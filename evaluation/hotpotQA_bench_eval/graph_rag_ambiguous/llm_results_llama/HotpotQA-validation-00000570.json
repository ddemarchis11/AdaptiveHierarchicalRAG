Starting in March 2018, the cycle begins again with VAQ-138 flying to Nellis AFB, Nevada, for RED FLAG 18–2. From May to December, the Rampaging Yellow Jackets once again found themselves stationed at Misawa, Japan for one of their most busy deployments yet by participating in the following exercises: MALABAR (Guam), THROWING KNIVES (Japan), NUDAY HUNTER (Guam), VALIANT SHIELD (Guam), PACIFIC THUNDER (South Korea), and KEEN SWORD (Japan). After finishing the 2018 deployment, 2019's training cycle started in February for the squadron's first trip to NAS Fallon for a missile shoot. The next trip to Fallon lasted just shy of two weeks, beginning 31 March; the final trip to Fallon occurred in mid June, also for two weeks. In between the detachments, three times throughout 2019, VAQ-138 supported GTI operations in Fallon. The final detachment took the Rampaging Yellow Jackets up to Eielson AFB, Alaska, for a red flag integration exercise with various platforms from the United States Air Force. In October 2019, VAQ-138 was sent West, back to Misawa AFB, Japan, in support of Seventh Fleet and national tasking requirements. While on detachment, the Yellow Jackets seized the opportunity to partner with the esteemed F-16 \"Wild Weasels\" of the 13th Fighter Squadron to accomplish unique training opportunities, increasing joint capabilities. Towards the end of January in 2019, while still stationed at Misawa AFB, a detachment was sent to Andersen AFB, Guam, to participate in Cope North for 5 weeks. At Cope North, VAQ-138 integrated with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), Japanese Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), United States Air Force (USAF), and the United States Marine Corps (USMC) assets to conduct multiple simulated large force strike. By the end of April, VAQ-138 and completed their mission and returned home to Whidbey Island, Washington. Later that year, the squadron played a role in Gunfighter Flag: a multi-branch/international integration exercise at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, to practice SEAD (suppression of enemy air defenses). The highlight of 2020 for VAQ-138 took place in September, as the squadron made base history: becoming the first squadron to execute a high-speed anti-radiation missile (HARM) shoot from home base NASWI.

      "text": "Map of the battle The Battle of Guam (21 July – 10 August 1944) was the American recapture of the Japanese-held island of Guam , an American territory in the Mariana Islands captured by the Japanese in the First Battle of Guam in 1941 during the Pacific campaign of World War II . The battle was a critical component of Operation Forager . The recapture of Guam and the broader Mariana and Palau Islands campaign resulted in the destruction of much of Japan's naval air power and allowed the United States to establish large airbases from which it could bomb the Japanese home islands with its new strategic bomber , the Boeing B-29 Superfortress . The invasion of Saipan was scheduled for 15 June 1944, with landings on Guam tentatively set for just three days later, but the Battle of the Philippine Sea and stubborn resistance by the unexpectedly large Japanese garrison on Saipan led to the invasion of Guam being postponed for over a month. On 21 July, American forces landed on both sides of the Orote Peninsula on the western side of Guam, planning to secure Apra Harbor . The 3rd Marine Division landed at Asan near Agana to the north of Orote, and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed near Agat to the south. The Marines at the two beachheads were pinned down by heavy Japanese fire, making initial progress inland quite slow. Supply was very difficult; landing ships could not come closer than the reef, several hundred yards from the beach, and amphibious vehicles were scarce. The 1st Provisional Brigade blocked off the Orote Peninsula on 25 July, and that night the Japanese counterattacked , in coordination with an attack against the 3rd Marine Division to the north. The effort was a failure. On 28 July the two beachheads were linked, and by 29 July the Americans had secured the Orote peninsula. The Japanese counterattacks against the beachheads and the fierce fighting beforehand had exhausted them. By the start of August, they were running out of food and ammunition, and they had only a handful of tanks left. They withdrew from southern Guam, planning to make a stand in the mountainous central and northern part of the island, and to engage in a delaying action. The Marines and the Army's 77th Infantry Division overran the rest of the island. Rain and thick jungle made conditions difficult for the Americans, but after an engagement with the main Japanese line of defense around Mount Barrigada from 2 to 4 August, the Japanese line collapsed. On 10 August organized Japanese resistance ended, and Guam was declared secure, but 7,500 Japanese soldiers were estimated to still be at large. Geography Guam , at 225 square miles (580 km 2 ), is the largest of the Mariana Islands , larger than the other fourteen major islands combined. It is 32 miles (51 km) long from north to south,",
