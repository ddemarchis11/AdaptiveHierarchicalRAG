He consoles Elio by advising him to keep his heart open for more joy and experiences rather than close himself off. During Hanukkah , Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married to a woman he has been intermittently dating for a few years. Elio calls Oliver by his (Elio's) name and Oliver responds with his (Oliver's); Oliver says \"[he] remember[s] everything\". After the call, Elio sits by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reflecting as his parents and staff prepare dinner.

Guadagnino described his approach to the film as \"lighthearted and simple\", a departure from his previous work, which has been called \"highly stylised [and] dazzling\". Guadagnino considers Call Me by Your Name a \"homage to the fathers of my life: my own father, and my cinematic ones\", referring to the filmmakers Jean Renoir , Jacques Rivette , Éric Rohmer , and Bernardo Bertolucci , who he says inspired him. Guadagnino has described Call Me by Your Name as a family-oriented film for the purpose of \"transmission of knowledge and hope that people of different generations come to see the film together\". He sees it not as a \"gay\" movie but as one about \"the beauty of the newborn idea of desire, unbiased and uncynical\", reflecting his motto of living \"with a sense of joie de vivre \". \"We should always be very earnest with one's feelings, instead of hiding them or shielding ourselves\", he said. He considers it an \"uplifting film\" about \"being who you want to be and finding yourself into the gaze of the other in his or her otherness.\" Guadagnino tried to avoid the flaws he had seen in most coming-of-age films , where growth is often portrayed as a result of resolving preconceived dilemmas such as an enforced choice between two lovers. He also wanted the story to follow two people",

      "text": "Edgar Selwyn (October 20, 1875 – February 13, 1944) was an American actor, playwright , director and producer on Broadway . A prominent figure in American theatre and film in the first half of the 20th century, he founded a theatrical production company with his brother, Archibald Selwyn , and owned a number of Selwyn Theatres in the United States. He transferred his talents from the stage to motion pictures, and directed a film for which Helen Hayes received the Academy Award for Best Actress . Selwyn co-founded Goldwyn Pictures in 1916. Biography Born in Cincinnati, Ohio , Selwyn flourished in the Broadway theater as an actor, playwright , director , and producer from 1899 to 1942. With his brother Archibald Selwyn (November 3, 1877 – June 21, 1959) he founded the theatrical production company The Selwyns which produced plays on Broadway from 1919 to 1932 (see, e.g., Wedding Bells ). The Selwyns owned several theatres in the United States including the Park Square Theatre in Boston; the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland, Ohio; the Selwyn in Chicago; and the Selwyn , Apollo , and Times Square theatres in New York City. Selwyn also worked in Hollywood, producing and directing eight films between 1929 and 1942. Among these was The Sin of Madelon Claudet (1931), which Selwyn directed for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . The film starred Helen Hayes , who won an Academy Award for her performance. Additionally, Selwyn wrote two screenplays and many more films were adapted from his original plays. He died in Los Angeles, California . Titanic sailing In April 1912 Selwyn and his wife, playwright Margaret Mayo , held tickets to New York on the RMS Titanic but did not make the trip as he had a prior engagement to hear the reading of a new play in Paris . They had had plans to accompany Broadway producer Henry B. Harris and his wife Renee with whom they had been touring Europe and Algiers . Selwyn's commitment to hearing the play, while others tried to goad him to board the ship, more than likely saved his life. His second wife was actress Ruth Selwyn , a sister of director Fred M. Wilcox and sister-in-law of Nicholas Schenck .
