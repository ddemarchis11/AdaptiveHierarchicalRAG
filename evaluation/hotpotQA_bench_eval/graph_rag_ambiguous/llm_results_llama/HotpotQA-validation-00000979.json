      "text": "Arthur Lubin (July 25, 1898 – May 11, 1995) was an American film director and producer who directed several Abbott & Costello films, Phantom of the Opera (1943), the Francis the Talking Mule series and created the talking-horse TV series Mister Ed . A prominent director for Universal Pictures in the 1940s and 1950s, he is perhaps best known today as the man who gave Clint Eastwood his first contract in film. Lubin, Motion Picture Magazine , August 1928 Early life Arthur William Lubovsky was born in Los Angeles in 1898. His father, William Lubovsky, had come to the US from Poland in 1889. He originally lived in Willsborough, Pennsylvania then moved to California. Lubovsky changed his name to Lubin in honour of filmmaker Siegmund Lubin and became a salesman. Lubin says his father \"became quite wealthy\" due to his success selling clothes and investments in copper mines in Arizona. His family moved to Jerome, Arizona , when Arthur was five. He was interested in acting at an early age, appearing in local Sunday school productions, with the encouragement of his mother, who died when Lubin was six. His father remarried and Lubin was sent away to the Page School for Little Boys, a military school. The family moved from Jerome to San Diego when Lubin was eight for the climate, to help with his step-mother's health. He managed the music and drama clubs at high school and said a key influence was playing the title role in The Vicar of Wakefield . He joined the San Diego Stock Company at $12 a week; the director was John Griffith Wray and the actors including Harold Lloyd . Lubin attended Carnegie Tech, in part on the recommendation of the head of English at his high school, because of its reputation as a drama school. He attended for three years and appeared regularly in plays. As a child he had worked as a water boy for touring theatre companies, such as the Virginia Brissoe stock company, and volunteered for circuses. He briefly served in the navy in World War One and attended Carnegie Tech , where he studied drama and made money by shifting scenery and props. On graduation from college in 1922, he decided to become an actor. He started appearing at the Pasadena Playhouse and was soon seen by talent scouts and put in films. He worked as a drama coach at Canadian Steel Mills before following one of his college drama teachers, B. Iden Payne, to New York. Actor In New York, Lubin managed to get work on stage in such plays as The Red Poppy , Anything Might Happen and My Aunt from Ypsilanti . None of these plays were particularly successful so he moved to Hollywood, where he succeeded in getting roles in some films such as His People . He also acted in stage, notably at the Potboiler Act Theatre. In",

The film was produced by Robert Arthur and directed by Arthur Lubin . It stars Donald O'Connor and Patricia Medina , with the distinctive voice of Francis provided by actor Chill Wills . Six Francis sequels from Universal followed the film, all but one starring O'Connor; Mickey Rooney replaced O'Connor in the final film of the series. Plot A bank manager speaks with teller Peter Stirling, who has been attracting public attention, and Stirling relates his story in a flashback . Stirling, a second lieutenant, is caught behind Japanese lines in Burma during World War II . A talking Army mule named Francis carries him to safety. Stirling later insists that the mule had rescued him, so he is placed in a psychiatric ward. Francis helps Stirling thwart enemy plans twice, and each time Stirling is returned to the psychiatric ward when he insists on crediting Francis. In an effort to obtain his release, Stirling asks three-star general Stevens to order Francis to speak, but Francis does not obey until it becomes clear that Stirling will be arrested for treason if he remains silent. Stevens is convinced and orders Stirling's release. During one of his hospital stays, Stirling is befriended by Maureen Gelder, a beautiful French refugee. He grows to trust her and tells her about Francis. Later, a propaganda radio broadcast from Tokyo Rose mocks the Allies for being advised by a mule, leading to the suspicion that Stirling or Gelder is a Japanese agent. The press is later informed that the absurd mule story was concocted to identify the spy. With help from Francis, the real culprit is identified as Gelder.

Nadel and Lubin had purchased the film rights from David Stern, with Stillman to produce and Lubin to direct. Lubin took the film to Universal, which had a commitment to Donald O'Connor for $30,000 and was looking to produce something inexpensive. The studio advanced Lubin $10,000 as a test to determine whether he could create the illusion of the mule speaking. The test was successful and Universal agreed to finance the film as a starring vehicle for Donald O'Connor . Lubin worked on the script with Stern, and Dorothy Davenport Reid contributed to the screenplay but was not credited within the film. Universal records show that Lubin was paid a flat fee of $25,000. Shooting Filming started on May 7, 1949 and continued until June. Parts of the film were shot at the Conejo Valley Airport in Thousand Oaks, California . Producer Robert Arthur said that the film was budgeted at $580,000 but finished $42,000 over budget. Lubin later claimed that the film had cost $150,000 and said: \"Donald got $30,000 at the time, the mule cost nothing. We had three mules then. And we made that picture in fifteen days.\" Reception Francis was first shown in January 1950 to Army troops stationed in West Germany .  Its premiere was held in New Orleans on February 8, 1950. In a contemporary review for The New York Times , critic Bosley Crowther wrote: \"[T]he whole gist and jesting of this farce are in an unsubtle demonstration that the mule is less of a jackass than is man—or, at least, than are men in the Army, in any eschelon [ sic ] above that of sergeant, especially second lieutenants and three-star 'brass.' And since this is an opinion to which millions of veterans will subscribe, the essential idea of 'Francis' is sure to be widely popular. Likewise its demonstration, for all its reliance on burlesque, is not beneath the mild appreciation of those who would have a good low laugh. ... Indeed, there are so many droll bits in 'Francis' that we hate to observe that it moves in a pretty small circle around one strictly fantastic joke and that it tends, in its limited revolutions, not only to repeat but to grow dull. Mr. Stern, with a very cute idea, has not endowed it with any real wit above the level of joke-book humor, which usually palls after the third time around. ...

The film that did win Best Picture was Driving Miss Daisy , a film that focused on race relations between an elderly Jewish woman ( Jessica Tandy ) and her driver ( Morgan Freeman ). Lee said in an April 7, 2006, interview with New York magazine that the other film's success, which he thought was based on safe stereotypes, hurt him more than if his film had not been nominated for an award. 1990–1999: Established director Lee at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival In 1990, Lee had his first collaboration with Denzel Washington in Mo' Better Blues . After the release of Mo' Better Blues , Lee was accused of antisemitism by the Anti-Defamation League and several film critics. They criticized the characters of the club owners Josh and Moe Flatbush, described as \" Shylocks \". Lee denied the charge, explaining that he wrote those characters in order to depict how black artists struggled against exploitation. Lee said that Lew Wasserman , Sidney Sheinberg , or Tom Pollock, the Jewish heads of MCA and Universal Studios , were unlikely to allow antisemitic content in a film they produced. He said he could not make an antisemitic film because Jews run Hollywood, and \"that's a fact\". His next film was Jungle Fever (1991), for which Samuel L. Jackson won acclaim for his performance as a crack addict. In 1992, Spike released his biographical epic film Malcolm X based on the Autobiography of Malcolm X , starring Denzel Washington as the famed civil rights leader . The film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his incarceration , his conversion to Islam , his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to Betty X , his pilgrimage to Mecca and reevaluation of his views concerning whites , and his assassination on February 21, 1965. Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness , and his experiences with racism are dramatized in flashbacks . The film received widespread critical acclaim including from critic Roger Ebert ranked the film No. 1 on his Top 10 list for 1992 and described the film as \"one of the great screen biographies, celebrating the sweep of an American life that bottomed out in prison before its hero reinvented himself.\" Ebert and Martin Scorsese , who was sitting in for late At the Movies co-host Gene Siskel , both ranked Malcolm X among the ten best films of the 1990s. Denzel Washington's portrayal of Malcolm X in particular was widely praised and he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor .

Despite thin, repetitive humor, critics like Bosley Crowther predicted broad popularity among veterans, and the picture’s success spawned six sequels and established a durable franchise for Universal-International.\n\n**Keywords**: Francis the Talking Mule, Arthur Lubin, Donald O’Connor, Universal-International, 1950 comedy franchise",
