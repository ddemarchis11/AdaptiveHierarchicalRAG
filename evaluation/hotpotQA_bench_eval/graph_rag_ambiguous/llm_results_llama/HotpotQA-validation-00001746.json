      "text": "Brag is an 18th century British card game , and the British national representative of the vying or \"bluffing\" family of gambling games. It is a descendant of the Elizabethan game of Primero and one of the several ancestors to poker , the modern version just varying in betting style and hand rankings. It has been described as the \"longest-standing British representative of the Poker family.\" History The rules of Brag first appear in 1721 in The Compleat Gamester where it is referred to as \"The Ingenious and Pleasant Game of Bragg\" , but in fact, it originates in an almost identical game called Post and Pair which is recorded as far back as 1528 (as Post ) and which, in turn, was descended from Primero. However, Brag introduced a key innovation over Post and Pair: the concept of wild cards known as 'braggers'. Initially there was just one, the Knave of Clubs ; later the Nine of Diamonds was added. In parallel with this early three-stake game, in 1751 Hoyle describes a version of Brag with a shortened pack that only had a single phase – the vying or 'bragging' round – with special powers for certain Jacks and Nines, thus anticipating the modern single-stake game. In 1825, an early American account of Brag describes a much more elaborate single-stake game with a complex vying procedure. Not until 1860 are rules for both variants published in one compendium, whereby \"Three Stake Brag\" is virtually unchanged from the earliest rules and the version of \"Single Brag\" described is less complicated than its American cousin. In a 1981 survey by Waddingtons , Brag was the fourth most popular card game in Britain. In 1992, Parlett stated that the classic three-stake variant (see Classic Brag below) was defunct; nevertheless, its rules were still being published in 2001. Classic Brag The earliest published rules for any form of Brag appear in Richard Seymour's 1721 revision of Charles Cotton 's The Compleat Gamester . They are less than complete, but with the aid of later descriptions, can be reconstructed. The following is based on Seymour, supplemented by The New Pocket Hoyle (1810). Classic Brag is a three-stake game and players ante 3 stakes, one for each phase of the game. Eldest hand deals 3 cards to each player in turn, turning the last card dealt to each player face up. The game phases are: Best Card In the first phase the player with the highest face-up card won the stakes, cards ranking in their natural order from Ace downwards, except that the A♦ outranked the other Aces. Bragging In the second phase, players passed or vied. The procedure is not detailed, but based on the 1810 Hoyle,",

Six cards, also, are expressly mentioned in the riddle itself, namely: \"the Knave\" (line 2), \"a King\" (3), \"Heart\" (5), \"Trey\", \"Quarter\" or quatre, and \"the Buck\" (7). \"The Buck\", probably one of the picture-cards, or the ace, inferior to \"Trey\", which is the best card in the game of put; therefore \"Trey\" comes \"to pull down the Buck\". \"The Buck\" is an old English synonym for the Coarse Appellation, intended, no doubt, for a Puritan , or for the Puritan party . \"Pulling down the Buck\", is also an allusion to hunting. John Dickson Carr 's novel The Devil in Velvet , set in 1675 London, includes a scene at Whitehall Palace in which the King's mistress Nell Gwyn and the courtier Ralph Montague play Put with stakes in the thousands of guineas. Gwyn is depicted as saying she prefers Put to other card games such as Ombre which are \"too slow\". The game of Put also appears in \"The English Rogue\", written by the Irish author Richard Head .

The dealer shuffles and non-dealer cuts. The dealer then gives three cards each, singly, non-dealer first. If there are more players, cards are dealt in clockwise order and the deal passes to the left each time. Non-dealer leads to the first trick. Players may always play any card; there are no trumps and no requirement to follow suit. The trick is taken by the higher card, and the winner of a trick leads to the next. If cards of equal rank are played e.g. two Threes or two Aces, the trick is tied. It is laid to one side and belongs to neither player. The same player then leads again. A player winning 2 o of the 3 tricks scores 1 point towards game. If each player wins a trick and the third is tied, it is \"trick and tye\" and neither scores. A player with a strong hand could say \"Put\" before playing to a trick. If the opponent declines, the 'putter' scores 1 point. If the opponent says \"I see it\", they play on and the one who takes most tricks wins the whole game, the Put, i.e. 5 or 7 points. There is no option to fold unless one's opponent has said \"Put\". Cotton's account of 1674 is reprinted until 1750 and appears again in Bohn (1850) and no other descriptions appear during the 18th century. Put (19th century) Pigott (1800) introduces new information. For the first time, methods of keeping score are described: whist counters, money as counters, chalking or drawing 5 lines or strokes with a pencil or chalk and erasing 1 line per point; the first to erase all 5 winning the game. In terms of play; a player can \"throw up his cards\", i.e. fold, on viewing the cards dealt or before playing a card to a trick, thus conceding 1 point to the opponent. Otherwise there is no practical change to the rules, a player being allowed to challenge with \"I put\" which, if accepted, means they will both play for the game. For the first time four-handed Put is described, whereby each person has a partner and when the cards are dealt, one partner gives the other their best card and throws the others two away; the partner receiving the card discards their worst card and a two-hand game is then played as normal. Strategy Considerable daring is necessary in this game, for a bold player will often \"Put\" upon very bad cards in order to tempt the adversary into giving him a point. Sometimes the hand is played with \"Putting\", when the winner of the three tricks,",

      "text": "Triomphe (French for triumph), once known as French ruff , is a card game dating from the late 15th century. It most likely originated in France or Spain (as triunfo) and later spread to the rest of Europe. When the game arrived in Italy, it shared a similar name with the pre-existing game and deck known as trionfi ; probably resulting in the latter becoming renamed as Tarocchi ( tarot ). While trionfi has a fifth suit that acts as permanent trumps , triomphe randomly selects one of the existing four suits as trumps. Another common feature of this game is the robbing of the stock. Triomphe became so popular that during the 16th century the earlier game of trionfi was gradually renamed tarocchi, tarot, or tarock. This game is the origin of the English word \"trump\" and is the ancestor of many trick-taking games like Euchre (via Écarté ) and Whist (via Ruff and Honours ). The earliest known description of Triomphe was of a point-trick game , perhaps one of the earliest of its type; later, the name was applied to a plain-trick game . Spanish rules The earliest surviving description was written by Juan Luis Vives in his Exercitatio linguae latinae around 1538 in Basel . As he left Spain in 1509 never to return, the rules may date to his youth. However the game was already widespread by then. In 1541, Juan Maldonado (d. 1554) expanded on Vives's rules and later revised them in 1549. Both Vives and Maldonado described the rules in the form of dialogues between the players. It is an ancestor of Ombre . The game is played by four players either individually or as partners. Maldonado uses a pack of 48 Spanish playing cards but Vives uses a French deck by discarding the 10s. In the suit of clubs and swords, the ranking from highest to lowest is King, Knight, Jack, 9 ... Ace while in the suit of cups and coins it is King, Knight, Jack, Ace ... 9. In the trump suit, the Ace is promoted above the King. Partners are chosen by drawing cards from the deck with the two highest and the two lowest going together. They sit opposite of one another. Each player is dealt nine cards with the top card of the remaining stock of 12 flipped to reveal the trump suit. If the exposed card is an Ace or a face card , the dealer has the right to exchange it for a card in his hand and get awarded three points. Players must follow suit , if devoid of that suit then they can play trumps or a card from another suit. Players with a weak hand can concede at any time and force a redeal but this is considered losing that particular",

      "text": "Crash is a British card game extension of Nine-card Brag and indeed is sometimes known as Thirteen Card Brag. In Crash, there is no betting, as in Brag, but rather players aim to reach a total of 15 points, gained over successive deals. Distribution Crash is played over much of northern England and Wales from Coventry and Burton-on-Trent in the south to the counties of Cumbria and Yorkshire in the north, also in Welshpool in north central Wales and in South Wales. It is also recorded in Plymouth and Edinburgh , where it is called Crackers . Rules Crash has many rule variations. Deal and play Players are dealt 13 cards each and must sort their hand into 4 Brag hands of three cards, or if you are lucky enough, in 3 sets of 4 of a kind, discarding the last remaining card. The hands rank as in Brag with the highest ranking hand being, 3 threes. All other hands are the same. Once the players have sorted their hands, each plays their highest ranked hand, and the player playing the highest gains one point. If hands are tied, no-one scores. Players then play their second-best hands, then their third best, then final hands. Note that not all players accept 'high card' hands, and many do not accept 'pairs', which means that it is quite common for a player not to have four hands. 'Crashing' Crashing in this game involve a person predicting they are going to win all four hands and calling 'crash'. If they win all after predicting they will win all four hands, usually there is a financial reward. If a player wins all four hands without calling crash, they usually receive a 50 pence reward. If they call crash and do not win all four hands, they usually have to pay a financial penalty of 50 pence to each player (a cost of 50p to £1.50 depending on whether it is 2, 3 or 4 players playing). Gambling The game is very popular in pubs and bars in the UK, and sometimes gambling is involved. All these rules depend on the rules of the house: An entry fee is used into a prize kitty and all players pay regardless of if they play or not commonly £1. If more than 4 players are involved, every player gets dealt a card, and if they receive a jack they enter the game, then stop receiving cards. This goes on until all players are dealt jacks. At the end of the game, every player except the winner must pay the winner for each point not earned (usually 20p). If a player crashes then the money for each point not earned is doubled, i.e. player B won on a crash, then Player C owes £2.80; however, this win can only be earned if a player needs more than 4 points to win.

      "text": "face-up card won the stakes, cards ranking in their natural order from Ace downwards, except that the A♦ outranked the other Aces. Bragging In the second phase, players passed or vied. The procedure is not detailed, but based on the 1810 Hoyle, beginning with elder hand, players would pass or say \"I brag\" and place a stake. If a player bragged, he could be challenged by another player matching or raising the stake. If two players wished to challenge, the elder took precedence. Vying continued between the two players until one passed or said \"I'll see you\" or the equivalent whereupon both revealed their hands. A prial (or pair royal ) beat a pair which beat a single card. Two pair royals were decided by their ranking; likewise two pairs and so on. The J♣ was a wild card, which could represent any other card, but a natural hand beat a 'wild' hand i.e. one with the Knave of Clubs. Some circles also admitted the 9♦ as a wild card. Thirty One In the third phase, players scored their hands and the first player to reach exactly 31 or, if no-one did, was closest to 31, won the stakes. To that end, courts and Aces scored 10 and pips their face value. Players could improve their hand by drawing a card from the stock, but if they 'drew out', i.e. exceeded 31, they lost. If two or more scored the same, they drew again until a winner was established. American Brag In 1825, the first American account of Brag appeared in a New York edition of Hoyle's Games Improved . This was a far more elaborate variant based solely on the bragging phase of classic Brag. Modern Brag Modern Brag, often called Three-Card Brag to distinguish it from its variants, is a single-stake game. Everyone antes , and players are each dealt three cards face down. There is a single round of betting, with action starting to the left of the dealer. Each player has the option of betting or folding . If there was a previous bet, the player must contribute at least that much more to the pot. (Unlike usual poker betting, a player's previous money contributed to the pot is ignored.) This betting continues until there are only two players left, at which point either player may double the previous bet to see his opponent. At this point, the two hands are revealed, and the player with the better hand takes the entire pot. If there is a tie, the player who is seeing loses. Hand ranks Hands generally follow the same sequence as the five-card hands of poker with some variation created by the differing odds of a three-card hand. By convention a prial (three of a kind) ranks first, above a straight flush, despite a prial being marginally more likely than a",

      "text": "2. If the dealer turns up the Ace as trumps, the dealer may 'ruff' (exchange) it with another card and, if agreed, may also exchange with the next card of the stock if it is a trump, continuing to exchange as long as trumps appear and laying out the cards discarded. This 'robbery' was known as 'ruffing' hence the name of the game. Players must follow suit or trump and overtrump if unable to follow; only discarding if unable to follow suit or trump. Winning three or four tricks scores 1 point, winning five tricks scores 5. If players agree, there are penalty points for incorrect dealing (1) or revoking (1 or 2). A player playing out of turn incurs 1 penalty point unless it is the last trick. Gambiter assumes that winning 5 tricks is only worth 2 points and that game is 5. Play is anti-clockwise and eldest hand (right of the dealer) leads to the first trick. However, it is not clear from what source these clarifications or changes are drawn from. German rules Incomplete rules from Strasbourg when it was still part of the Holy Roman Empire were recorded in both French and German (as Trümpfspiel) in 1637. Its rules are similar to the Dutch game of Troeven (\"Trumps\"). Aces are high and deuces are low. Each player takes a card from the deck; the lowest becomes the dealer. The dealer passes out nine cards to each player with the remaining cards forming the stock. The dealer exposes one card from the stock which will be the trump suit. If the dealer exposes an ace, he can exchange a worthless card for it. He can do the same with the remainder of the stock taking any trumps until he exposes a non-trump. The highest trump cards are fixed: the Ace of Hearts, the King of Diamonds, the Queen of Spades, and the Jack of Clubs. The object of each hand is to capture cards with the most points. Aces are worth four, kings three, queens two, and jacks one; in total there should be 40 points. If a player achieves a slam (winning all the tricks), he will get 80 points. It was thus a point-trick game , probably one of the earliest known. French rules Though Triomphe can be traced back to the 1480s in France, the earliest surviving rules date to 1659. French Triomphe was played by four players divided into two partnerships with a 52-card deck. The order of the cards from highest to lowest is King, Queen, Jack, Ace, 10, 9 ... 2. Each player takes a card from the deck, the one with the highest card becomes the dealer and passes five cards face down to everyone. The remaining 32 cards form the stock. The dealer then turns up",

Betting blind Players also have the option of playing blind (betting without looking at their cards). A blind player's costs are all half as much as an open (non-blind) player's. However, an open player may not raise or see a blind player. If all other players fold to a blind player, at least two variations exist - either the blind player takes the pot and the next round continues as normal; or alternatively, the pot remains, everyone re-antes, and the blind player gets to keep his hand for the next round (in addition to the new one he is dealt). At any time, a player with two blind hands may look at one of them and decide whether to keep it or throw it away. If he keeps it, he throws away the other hand and is considered open. If he throws it away, he keeps the other hand and is still blind. If everyone folds to a blind player with two hands, he must throw away one without looking. As with many rules in card games, regional differences apply to this rule. Shuffling Another unusual custom of Brag is that the deck is rarely shuffled . Unless a hand is seen and won by a prial , the cards from the hand are just placed on the bottom of the deck, and the next hand is dealt without shuffling.

Early rules required capturing the majority of tricks or points; later versions introduced bidding (Bête), pot contests (Mouche/Bourre), and special high cards (Pamphile). The game’s terminology gave English the word “trump” and influenced successors like Écarté, Euchre, and Whist.  \n\n**Keywords**:  \nTriomphe, French Ruff, trump suit, trick-taking, card-game history",

Players arrange their cards into four three-card Brag hands, earning points by winning each hand in sequence. A player may call “crash” to predict sweeping all four hands; success brings a cash bonus, while failure incurs a penalty paid to every opponent. Gambling variants add an entry kitty and end-of-game settlements where unpaid points cost 20 p each, doubled if the winner crashed. Four-of-a-kind is the highest hand, triggering extra payouts, followed by three-of-a-kind, suited runs (bouncers), mixed runs, flushes and pairs.  \n\n**Keywords**: Crash, Brag, crash-call, four-of-a-kind, point penalties",
