      "text": "Crassothonna capensis (previously Othonna capensis ), also known as little pickles (USA) , ruby necklace (Australia), Cape aster, Cape Othonna , and Bobbejaankool (Afrikaans), is a species of the genus Crassothonna previously ( Othonna ) in the family Asteraceae , and is a native of the Eastern Cape of South Africa . It is a native highveld species that originates from the southern Drakensberg region. Description This species is a low-growing, succulent, spreading ground cover with finger-like, blue-grey leaves, spirally arranged, which become tipped with maroon in dry conditions. It has yellow daisy-like flowers on long, slender stems. Taxonomy It was described by L.H. Bailey in 1901 and published in the Cyclopedia of American Horticulture replacing the original description and name from 1865 Othonna crassifolia Harv. In turn, the genus was changed from Othonna by Nordenstam et al., who erected the new genus Crassothonna for the clade of Othonna species O. sedifolia, O. alba and O. capensis . The new name for this species is therefore Crassothonna capensis (L.H.Bailey) B.Nord. Distribution and habitat This species is endemic to the Eastern Cape Province in semi-arid Karoo scrub and dry, rocky flats, often in the partial protection of surrounding vegetation or rocks. Cultivation In cultivation, the species is commonly called little pickles in the USA or ruby necklace in Australia and is used for rockeries, terrariums, indoor hanging pots and outside xeriscaping .

This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing. It includes some common wildflowers , such as the California buckwheat ( Eriogonum fasciculatum ). The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux , explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus ( E. tomentosum ) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ( \"planta lanata, geniculata\" ). Despite sharing the common name \"buckwheat\", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat . In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened. One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat ( Eriogonum truncatum , believed to be extinct) was rediscovered. Ecology Eriogonum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). An example of a butterfly that uses this plant for food is the Lycaena heteronea . Several of these are monophagous , meaning their caterpillars only feed on this genus, sometimes just on a single taxon of Eriogonum . Wild buckwheat flowers are also an important source of food for these and other Lepidoptera. In some cases, the relationship is so close that Eriogonum and dependent Lepidoptera are in danger of coextinction . Monophagous Lepidoptera on wild buckwheat include: Apodemia mormo (Mormon metalmark) – feeds exclusively on Eriogonum Apodemia mormo langei (Lange's metalmark) – only known from Eriogonum nudum ssp. auriculatum Chionodes dammersi – feeds exclusively on Eriogonum Chionodes luteogeminatus – only known from Eriogonum niveum Euphilotes enoptes smithi ( Smith's blue butterfly ) – only known from Eriogonum latifolium and Eriogonum parvifolium Euphilotes battoides allyni ( El Segundo blue butterfly ) - only known from Eriogonum parvifolium Additionally, bees of the sagebrush steppe rely on the nectar of desert buckwheats, and birds and rodents eat the seeds.

Classified in the frog's-bit family ( Hydrocharitaceae ), Elodea is native to the Americas and is also widely used as aquarium vegetation and laboratory demonstrations of cellular activities. It lives in fresh water. An older name for this genus is Anacharis , which serves as a common name in North America. The introduction of some species of Elodea into waterways in parts of Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand has created a significant problem and it is now considered a noxious weed in these areas.

As Elodea spreads into new ecosystems, it experiences rapid growth for 5–6 years and then slows as soil nutrients are used up. Elodea is threatening aquatic environments across Europe. Chemicals may be used in places that cause undue economic concerns, but very few aquatic herbicides are registered for aquatic use in the EU. Fluridone , the most commonly used aquatic herbicide is highly effective against Hydrilla, but only marginally effective against Elodea, especially at lower use rates. Mechanical control An aquatic weed harvester collecting Elodea from a lake The plants can also be removed from lakes and rivers mechanically. They are extracted either by hand or by using rakes, chains, mowing boats or weed buckets. The problem is that through vegetative reproduction via fragments, mechanical removal methods can contribute to the spread of the plant. Torn fragments can be transported downstream or are introduced to new environments via attachment to boats and anchor chains.

The genus Othonnna is known to be monophyletic. In 2012, a new genus Crassothonna B. Nord. was erected with 13 species transferred from Othonna . A complete modern taxonomic treatment of the genus is being undertaken by the Compton Herbarium and the South African National Biodiversity Institute . The first part, a revision of the Othonnna bulbosa group (those species that are geophytic with an aerial stem), was published in 2019. The name Othonna is derived from the Ancient Greek ὄθοννα and the Latin othone, which is a linen cloth or napkin, in allusion to the downy covering of some of the earlier known species.

It consists of more than 130 species, with the center of diversity being Australia and Polynesia . There are around 80 species in Australia, occurring throughout the continent, in a variety of habitats. Diversity is highest in the South West, where around 40 species are endemic . Common names for Scaevola species include scaevolas , fan-flowers , half-flowers , and naupaka , the plants' Hawaiian name. The flowers are shaped as if they have been cut in half. Consequently, the generic name means \" left-handed \" in Latin . Many Hawaiian legends have been told to explain the formation of the shape of the flowers. In one version a woman tears the flower in half after a quarrel with her lover. The gods, angered, turn all naupaka flowers into half flowers and the two lovers remained separated while the man is destined to search in vain for another whole flower. Scaevola taccada in Rangareddy district of Andhra Pradesh , India . Scaevola is the only Goodeniaceae genus that is widespread outside of Australia . In at least six separate dispersals, about 40 species have spread throughout the Pacific Basin , with a few reaching the tropical coasts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans . The Hawaiian Islands are home to ten Scaevola species, nine of which are endemic . Eight of the indigenous species are the result of a single colonization event. Scaevola glabra and Scaevola taccada arrived separately to produce a total of three colonizations of Hawaii by Scaevola . Some of the endemic species are of hybrid origin. Beach naupaka ( Scaevola taccada synonym S. sericea ) occurs throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans and is considered an invasive species in Florida, USA, and in some islands of the Caribbean including the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas . Beachberry or Inkberry ( Scaevola plumieri ) is widespread along the Atlantic coast of the tropical Americas and Africa ; however, it is becoming rarer in areas where S. taccada is displacing native coastal plants. Most Australian Scaevola have dry fruits and sprawling, herbaceous to shrubby habits.

      "text": "Vanilla orchids form the flowering plant genus Vanilla made of about 110 species in the orchid family ( Orchidaceae ). These orchids are found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, from tropical America to tropical Asia , New Guinea and West Africa . Five species are known from the contiguous United States, all limited to southern Florida. The most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla ( V. planifolia ), native to Mexico and Belize, from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived. It is the only orchid widely used for industrial purposes in flavoring such products as foods, beverages and cosmetics, and is recognized as the most popular aroma and flavor . The key constituent imparting its flavour is the phenolic aldehyde vanillin . The genus was established in 1754 by Plumier, after J. Miller. The word vanilla , derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina ( vaina itself meaning sheath or pod), simply translates as little pod. Description Flat-leaved vanilla ( Vanilla planifolia ) habitus This genus of vine -like plants has a monopodial climbing habitus . They can form long thin stems with a length of more than 35 m, with alternate leaves spread along their length. The short, oblong, dark green leaves of Vanilla are thick and leathery, even fleshy in some species. But there are also a significant number of species that have their leaves reduced to scales or have become nearly or totally leafless and appear to use their green climbing stems for photosynthesis . Long and strong aerial roots grow from each node. Vanilla plantations require trees for the orchids to climb and anchor by its roots. Flowers and fruit The racemose inflorescence 's short-lived flowers arise successively on short peduncles from the leaf axils or scales. There may be up to 100 flowers on a single raceme, but usually no less than 20. The flowers are quite large and attractive with white, green, greenish yellow or cream colors. The flowers' sepals and petals are similar. The lip is tubular-shaped and surrounds the long, bristly column , opening up, as the bell of a trumpet, at its apex. The anther is at the top of the column and hangs over the stigma , separated by the rostellum. Most Vanilla flowers have a sweet scent. Blooming occurs only when the flowers are fully grown. Each flower opens up in the morning and closes late in the afternoon on the same day, never to reopen. If pollination has not occurred meanwhile, it will be shed. The flowers are self-fertile, but need pollinators to perform this task. Pollinated flowers produces elongate, fleshy and later dehiscent capsule fruits 10–20 cm long with watery pulp ; the fruit ripens gradually for 8 to 9 months after flowering, eventually turning black in color and giving",

They grow in shade under trees and shrubs. Their leaves arise more or less directly from ground level, where their flowers also appear. The number of species known has increased considerably from the 1980s onwards, with around 100 accepted as of July 2013 [update] . Aspidistra elatior is common worldwide as a foliage house plant that is very tolerant of neglect. It and other species can also be grown in shade outside, where they are generally hardy to −15 °C (5 °F). Description Species of Aspidistra are perennial herbaceous plants growing from rhizomes . The leaves are either solitary or are grouped in small \"tufts\" of two to four. They arise more or less directly from the rhizome, rather than being borne on stems. Each leaf has a long stalk ( petiole ) and a blade with many veins. The flowering stem ( scape ) is usually very short so that the flowers appear low down among the leaves. The fleshy flowers are bell-, urn- or cup-shaped. They vary considerably in size and shape, although few are showy. The flowers of A. longipedunculata are yellow and, unusually for the genus, are borne on scapes up to 20 cm (8 in) high. A. grandiflora has spider-like flowers up to 12 cm (5 in) across. The flower has a large stigma with a flattened top. The fruit is a berry , often with a single seed. Taxonomy The genus Aspidistra was named by the English botanist John Ker Gawler in 1822, as a blend of Greek ασπίς/ασπίδ- aspid- , meaning shield, and the name of the sister genus Tupistra . The genus was at one time placed in a broadly defined Liliaceae, along with many other lilioid monocots . It has also been placed in the families Convallariaceae and Ruscaceae. The APG III system of 2009 places it in the family Asparagaceae , subfamily Convallarioideae . Species Aspidistra is a genus that was largely ignored by field botanists until the 1980s onwards, and there has been a rapid rise in the number of recognised species since then. Some 8 to 10 species were known in the late 1970s; 30 new species were described from China in the 1980s. Subsequently, more new species were found in Vietnam.

Established by Linnaeus in 1753 with 14 species, only four original taxa remain in the genus while others were reassigned to genera such as Senecio and Euryops; 13 former Othonna species now reside in the segregate genus Crassothonna (2012). A modern taxonomic revision led by the Compton Herbarium and SANBI is underway, beginning with the 2019 treatment of the geophytic O. bulbosa group. The name Othonna references a linen cloth, alluding to the downy indumentum of early-known species, and several species are colloquially called “bobbejaankool” (baboon cabbages) in Afrikaans.\n\n**Keywords**: Othonna, Crassothonna, Cape Floristic Region, taxonomic revision, succulent perennials",

Optimal growing conditions include warm temperatures (70–85 °F), high humidity (~80%), well-drained loamy soils rich in organic matter, and support structures for the climbing vines. Propagation is primarily through stem cuttings, and fertilization involves balanced NPK and organic inputs. Post-harvest curing—comprising killing, sweating, drying, and conditioning—develops the characteristic vanilla flavor, with grading based on pod length, appearance, and moisture content.
