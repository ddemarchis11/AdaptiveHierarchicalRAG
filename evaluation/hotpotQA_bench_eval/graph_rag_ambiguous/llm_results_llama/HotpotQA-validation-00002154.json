      "text": "\" You Kent Always Say What You Want \" is the twenty-second and final episode of the eighteenth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 20, 2007, as part of the one-hour season finale , alongside the episode \" 24 Minutes \". It was the milestone 400th episode of The Simpsons and was written by Tim Long and directed by Matthew Nastuk . In this episode, Kent Brockman is fired for swearing on air and moves in to the Simpson home where he and Lisa investigate the Republican Party. The episode guest starred Ludacris as himself and Maurice LaMarche as the Fox announcer. It received positive reviews. It was the last episode to air prior to The Simpsons Movie , which was released two months later on July 27, 2007. Special opening In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the show (when counting the shorts), the entire opening sequence is replaced with a black screen that reads, \"20 Years Ago...\" followed by a showing of The Tracey Ullman Show Simpsons short \"Family Portrait\", which involves Homer failing the shot on multiple occasions. Plot Driving home after a trip to the dentist , Homer takes the Simpson family to an ice cream parlor , where he buys the store's millionth ice cream cone. This results in Homer appearing on Kent Brockman 's TV news talk show Smartline on Channel 6 since both have the same owner. Kent is disgusted that he is forced to do a fluff piece instead of an in-depth, intellectually stimulating discussion of the conflict in the Middle East . During the interview, Homer accidentally knocks Kent's cup of coffee into his lap, making him swear in pain. After the commercial break, Kent apologizes, but is relieved to find that, as the Internet has supplanted television as a source of news information, no one saw his on-air faux pas. However, Ned Flanders reviews the incident and gets people of alike minds to report it to the Federal Communications Commission . The next day, during the newscast, Kent finds out that he is under scrutiny for his indiscretion and that the station has been fined $10 million. He is demoted to weekend weatherman with his rival, Arnie Pye , as the new anchorman. Later, Lindsey Naegle speaks to Kent, assuring him that his job is safe, but fires him on the pretence that he has put cocaine in his coffee cup, ignoring his insistence that it is actually Splenda . Marge invites a suicidal Kent to sleep over at the Simpson house. While watching TV the next day, Lisa wonders why the cable channel Fox News can be so conservative while the Fox Network broadcasts sexualized content. Kent replies that Fox deliberately airs programs with morally reprehensible content so that they will be fined by the FCC, with the fines being funneled to the Republican Party . According to Brockman, everyone in",

      "text": "\" At Long Last Leave \" is the fourteenth episode of the twenty-third season of the American animated television series The Simpsons , and the 500th episode overall of the series. In this episode, the Simpsons discover that the inhabitants of Springfield have grown tired of them and have secretly decided to throw them out of the city. After being evicted from Springfield, the family members end up in a rugged place without rules and regulations called the Outlands. There, they briefly come across their neighbor Julian Assange , who created WikiLeaks . Assange guest-starred in the episode as himself and recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in Britain, while waiting for the results of Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority . Michael Price wrote the episode without the intention of it becoming the 500th episode and felt honored when it was selected for the milestone. Television critics have given the episode generally positive reviews, particularly praising it for a montage of the series' couch gags that was included in the opening sequence . The storyline of \"At Long Last Leave\" has, however, received criticism for being similar to the main story structure previously done in The Simpsons Movie . During its original airing on the Fox network in the United States on February 19, 2012, the episode was watched by about 5.77 million people and received a 2.6 Nielsen rating in the demographic for adults aged 18–49 . Before this broadcast, Fox promoted the 500th episode milestone by arranging an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for longest continuous television viewing. A hundred fans of The Simpsons were invited to watch a marathon of the series' episodes, starting on February 8, 2012. The record was broken 86 hours and 37 minutes later on February 12, 2012, with only two fans left watching the marathon. Plot The Simpson family is advised of a citywide nuclear safety drill and all the inhabitants of Springfield are told to stay in their basements for three hours. The family members quickly become bored in the basement and decide to leave the house and go see the empty city. As they walk through Springfield, they see an unusual number of cars parked by the City Hall. The Simpsons go in and discover that everyone in town has gathered for a secret town meeting and have voted unanimously to kick them out of Springfield forever. Mayor Quimby reveals that the city has gone bankrupt due to the constant cleaning up of the family's shenanigans over the years, ranging from Homer 's drunken antics, Bart 's various pranks, and Lisa 's environmental concerns. Marge delivers a heart-felt plea to the residents to let the Simpsons live in the one place they call home, but they refuse, with Quimby declaring her the \"worst Simpson\" for always trying to see the family in a positive light. Ned attempts to defend the Simpsons by claiming no one should be quick to judge without being judged themselves. Quimby, having anticipated this, decides",

Hawaiʻi enters as a College Division Independent. The Rainbows continue to play local teams on occasion but the bulk of their schedules are made up of collegiate teams. Hank Vasconcellos era (1952–1960) 1955 – A year after suffering a 50–0 blowout loss to Nebraska in Honolulu, the Rainbows go up to Lincoln the following season and upset the Huskers 6–0. The win is considered one of the school's all-time biggest upsets. 1961 – The UH Board of Athletic Control votes to abolish the football program due to a lack of finances. The program would return to intercollegiate competition the following year behind the urgings of new athletics director Young Suk Ko . Jim Asato era (1962–1964) Shaughnessy-Sarboe-King era (1965–1967) 1965 – Larry Price performed in his third Hula Bowl as a College All-Star after a stint in the U.S. Army where he performed twice for the Hawai'i All-Stars. Legendary coach Clark Shaughnessy takes over for one season but the Rainbows flounder through a 1–8–1 season. 1966 – Phil Sarboe, after 15 seasons as head coach at Humboldt State, guides the team to a 4–6 record playing its first all-collegiate schedule. He resigns for \"personal reasons\" after the season. 1967 – Don King, an assistant under Sarboe, becomes head coach and the much-improved Rainbows post a 6–4 record. Significantly, large crowds (18,000 to 20,000) flock to Honolulu Stadium to watch the Rainbows for the first time in many years, setting the stage for a major gridiron revival in future years.

From 1968–1974, UH won 67 percent of its games and never suffered a losing season. Holmes still ranks as the all-time leader at Hawaiʻi in winning percentage (.718).

      "text": "Codename: Kids Next Door is an American animated spy fiction television series created by Mr. Warburton for Cartoon Network . It was produced by Curious Pictures with assistance from Cartoon Network Studios . The series follows the adventures of a diverse group of five children who operate from a high-tech treehouse , fighting against adult and teenage tyranny with advanced 2×4 technology. Using their code names (Numbuhs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), they are Sector V, part of a global organization called the Kids Next Door. The series' pilot premiered on Cartoon Network in mid-2001 as part of The Big Pick II , a special broadcast event showcasing 11 pilots for different series. The winner of a viewers' poll by Cartoon Network would decide which pilot would be greenlit to be a full series. After winning the poll, the series premiered on December 6, 2002, and concluded on January 21, 2008, after six seasons and 81 episodes. Two television films were broadcast: Operation: Z.E.R.O. , which aired in 2006, and Operation: I.N.T.E.R.V.I.E.W.S. , which aired as the series finale in 2008. A special half-hour crossover episode with fellow Cartoon Network series, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy , aired in 2007. Spin-off media include two video games, Operation S.O.D.A. and Operation V.I.D.E.O.G.A.M.E. , as well as a trading card game, comic books, and DVD releases. Codename: Kids Next Door has also appeared in DVD anthologies and compilation video games from Cartoon Network. Overview From left to right: Numbuh 2, Numbuh 4, Numbuh 3, Numbuh 1, and Numbuh 5.

Their mission is to fight crimes against children (such as homework , flossing , doctor , baths, bedtime, teeth brushing, babysitters , sharing, doing chores, etc.), many of which are willingly committed by \"evil\" adults , senior citizens , teenagers , and occasionally other children. Numbuh 1 is a level-headed, no-nonsense British boy named Nigel Uno, leader of Sector V. Numbuh 2 is an overweight, nerdy American boy named Hogarth \"Hoagie\" Pennywhistle Gilligan, Jr. Numbuh 3 is a friendly, happy-go-lucky Japanese girl named Kuki Sanban.

As with past adaptations this one does take some liberties with history. The series also parodies the violent atmosphere of Chicago during the Dry Law , as well as the old American films, their heroes and villains. The main characters in this series are four friendly mice: Elliot \"Mouse\", Gordon, Mr. Wilson, and Jack the Irishman, although there are also some cats and dogs. Plot The citizens of \"Cheesecago\" are defenceless against \"Al Catone's\" mobsters until a few brave federal agents from the \"Federal Mousehole of Investigation\" headed by \"Elliot Mouse\" dare to take on the gangsters. In spite of their rivalry and continuous fights, they control gambling, shows, races and every business in town. They charge poor people and terrified traders with high taxes; they rob, and kidnap, but their biggest racket is in confiscating cheese and then deal with it illegally so that it fetches very high prices, often causing Cheesecago citizens to get ripped off.

I just like knowing it's still there. ... It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate. But even after 500 episodes, it still has a little something left.\" Goodman described the couch gag as \"lovely\". Matt Roush of TV Guide wrote favorably about \"At Long Last Leave\", describing it as a \"keeper\" and highlighting the \"dazzling opening sequence\". He concluded that The Simpsons \"once again delivers the goods, proving itself to be a classic for our age and for the ages.\" Childs was less positive, writing that the episode is \"nothing special\" as \"all of the elements seem drawn from earlier stories\" and \"only a few of the jokes rise to the lowered bar of latter-day Simpsons humor.\" He added, however, that \"nothing in the episode goes outrageously wrong, either. There is little Family Guy -style stupidity and randomness, the satire is gently pointed inward, and the guest star, while splashy for his controversiality, does not hijack the plot—instead appearing for a single joke before vanishing.\" Time critic James Poniewozik commented that \"At Long Last Leave\" was an \"all right\" episode, noting that certain gags felt \"forced by the writers' room\". He added however that \"a few moments made me bark out loud and realize why I loved the show in the first place.\" References External links Wikiquote has quotations related to \"At Long Last Leave\" .

Despite Brockman’s on-line exposé, party bosses silence him with a lucrative re-hire, underscoring the show’s theme that contemporary media lacks courage or integrity.
