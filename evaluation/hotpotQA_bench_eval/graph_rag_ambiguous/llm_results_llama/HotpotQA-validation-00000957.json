      "text": "Triumph the Insult Comic Dog is a puppet character created, puppeteered, and voiced by actor/comedian/director Robert Smigel . As his name indicates, Triumph's comedic style is almost exclusively insult comedy . A Rottweiler & Montenegrin Mountain Hound ,  Triumph often is seen with a cigar in his mouth, which usually falls out when he starts talking. He first appeared in 1997 on NBC 's Late Night with Conan O'Brien , and also appeared on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien from time to time, as well as the short-lived TV Funhouse , TBS 's Conan , Adult Swim 's The Jack and Triumph Show , The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , The Daily Show , and Hollywood Squares . Smigel and Triumph have been ejected from several events for Triumph's antics, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show , the Honolulu line for auditions for American Idol , and the 2004 Democratic National Convention (while shooting an aborted movie project). Creation and debut Robert Smigel (right) performing his puppet character, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, at 2008 Republican National Convention with Associated Press production assistant (left) The dog puppet was found, in an assortment of animal puppets, at a country furniture store, by Robert Smigel and his newlywed-wife, which Smigel used in-store to jokingly \"smell\" his newlywed-wife's rear end. She bought an assortment of seven of those animal puppets, and later presented them to Smigel as a birthday gift. For four years, Late Night with Conan O'Brien had done remote segments parodying the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show . On February 13, 1997, Triumph , the character, created by Robert Smigel , was first used for a segment on Late Night with Conan O'Brien parodying the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show , where Triumph ( Ch. Triumph's Honor of Whitehall, Rottweiler, Yugoslavian Mountain Hound) appeared as a Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show winner (Hound division) in a vaudeville stage, with an Insult Comic talent, telling \"for me to poop on\" jokes later used in post-interview segments with ill-informed guests. Triumph speaks with a nebulous Eastern European accent, which Smigel based on his grandparents who were immigrants from Russia . Triumph first became a \"viral video\" at iFilm . Notable appearances Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show In 1999, Jordan Schlansky and the Triumph entourage crashed the 123rd annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden , New York City, and after some video shooting, were later ejected by security guards. Star Wars In May 2002, Triumph paid a visit to Star Wars fans lining up for the premiere of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones outside the Ziegfeld Theater in New York, airing",

Star Wars In May 2002, Triumph paid a visit to Star Wars fans lining up for the premiere of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones outside the Ziegfeld Theater in New York, airing 2002-05-17, mocking their actions and stereotypical nerd culture . Notable moments include a wedding that took place at the line, and the appearances of Blackwolf the Dragonmaster (Richard Washington), a real-life fantasy gaming fan and the \"Unofficial Wizard of New York\", and Spock who gave everyone the finger . Smigel has said \"It's still the Triumph sketch I hear the most about and I'd say it's still the best. The simplest explanation is that it features the funniest straight men Triumph's ever encountered. So you're laughing not only at the jokes but the faces, the costumes and committment [sic]. There's so much to enjoy.\" Space Ghost Coast to Coast In 2004, Triumph appeared as the guest star on the hit Adult Swim series Space Ghost Coast to Coast in the episode \"Dreams\". Triumph offhandedly mentions having anal sex with Lassie , which causes friction between Space Ghost and Moltar over such topics being brought up on television.  MTV Video Music Awards and incident with Eminem In 2001 and 2002, Triumph appeared in the audience at the MTV Video Music Awards . In 2001, Triumph interviewed Carson Daly before spotting Jennifer Lopez and asking if he could sniff her butt. In 2002, Triumph interviewed Moby before spotting Eminem , who covered Triumph with his hand, saying \"I already got my TV time\". Triumph was then shoved away by Eminem's bodyguards. The following day, Triumph appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien , and gave a press conference about the incident while wearing a neck brace. Triumph later appeared in Eminem's music video for \" Ass Like That \", and at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards , Eminem began his performance by voicing a lookalike puppet. 2004 presidential campaign Triumph filmed a number of segments during the 2004 US presidential election cycle. In November 2003, in the early days of the 2004 U.S. presidential primary campaign , Triumph was the \"lead guest\" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno the same night that Democratic candidate John Kerry also appeared on the show. Kerry made a dramatic entry, riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle onto the stage; but Triumph, in characteristic style, poked fun at him with a series of scathingly rude remarks, to Kerry's evident discomfort. (Among his jibes: \"The poop I made in the dressing room had more heat than John Kerry!\") In July and August 2004, Triumph followed up with visits to both major parties' national conventions . During the Democratic National Convention in Boston (from",

Two Triumph puppets were in use, dressed as Vance’s grandmother and WWE star Hulk Hogan. They were briefly interviewed by CNN’s Jake Tapper before the broadcast ended. On October 27, 2024, Triumph interviewed attendees waiting to attend a Donald Trump rally at Madison Square Garden. At one point, he dons face paint and Viking horns to resemble Jacob Chansley . Triumph caps the segment with a crowd song parodying conservative sentiments. Both incidents aired as correspondent pieces for The Daily Show . Triumph reappeared at the People's March in Washington, D.C. in January 2025. Trademark lawsuit In 1999, after Triumph accused Pets.com 's sock puppet mascot of being a \"rip-off\" of Triumph on television shows, in print media, online, and in a letter, the company sent lawsuit threats and cease and desist letters to Smigel claiming \"unfair competition, dilution and potentially tortious interference with contract in violation of federal and state laws\" and the following year filed a lawsuit against Late Night and Smigel. The bankruptcy and closing of the company during the dot-com bust of 2000 ended the lawsuit.  Triumph humped the Pets.com dog in a bathroom during a segment of Late Night as an act of revenge. Discography Triumph's 2003 album, Come Poop with Me , was released by Warner Bros. Records , and featured adult comedy and songs, plus a bonus DVD of live performances by Triumph. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. Appearing with Triumph on the album and the DVD were singer-actor Jack Black , comic actor Adam Sandler , Saturday Night Live cast members Maya Rudolph and Horatio Sanz ; Blackwolf the Dragonmaster from the Star Wars skit; and Conan O'Brien.

      "text": "Joseph Abraham Gottlieb (February 3, 1918 – October 17, 2007), known professionally as Joey Bishop , was an American entertainer who appeared on television as early as 1948 and eventually starred in his own weekly comedy series playing a talk / variety show host, then later hosted a late-night talk show with Regis Philbin as his young sidekick on ABC. He also was a member of the \" Rat Pack \" with Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford . He is listed as the 96th entry on Comedy Central's list of 100 greatest comedians. Early life and education Bishop, the youngest of five children, was born on February 3, 1918, in the Bronx , New York City, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants Anna (née Siegel) and Jacob Gottlieb. His father was a bicycle repairman. Bishop was raised in South Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Bishop was drafted into the US Army during World War II , and he rose to the rank of sergeant in the Special Services , serving at Fort Sam Houston in Texas . Career Bishop appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson , c. 1975 Bishop began his career in the 1930s when he skipped his final semester of high school to form a comedy trio with two other boys, performing in nightclubs and burlesque houses in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and throughout the East Coast . The boys were not related, but called themselves the \"Bishop Brothers\", borrowing the name of their driver, Glenn Bishop, with each adopting \"Bishop\" as their stage name. The act was originally made up of Morris \"Rummy\" Spector, Joey, and Sammy Reisman - who soon dropped out and was replaced by Mel Farber - and were individually known as Rummy Bishop, Joey Bishop, and Mel Bishop - stage names they would keep throughout their careers. The act broke up when Rummy was drafted during World War II , with Joey Bishop continuing as a solo performer until he himself was drafted in 1942. Bishop would later include his former partners in his projects, with Rummy Bishop having a small role in Oceans 11 and Mel Bishop appeared in several roles on The Joey Bishop Show , including one episode. \"Must the Show Go On?\" in which all three \"Bishop Brothers\" were reunited for the first time since the 1940s. Bishop resumed his solo career after he was discharged from the military in August 1945, working at the Casablanca Roadhouse in New Jersey and then becoming an opening act in New York City at the Greenwich Village Inn. He became a regular performer at New York's Latin Quarter nightclub for $1,000 a week, which led to appearances on television and film. Bishop appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show on May 28, 1950. In 1952, Frank Sinatra saw Bishop perform at the Latin Quarter",

      "text": "The Jack and Triumph Show is a television sitcom from Universal Television for Adult Swim that premiered on February 20, 2015, and ended on April 3, 2015, with a total of 7 episodes. The live-action series was created by Robert Smigel , Michael Koman , and David Feldman . The series features Jack McBrayer playing Jack Mlicki, the former child star of a fictional Lassie -like series. The puppet Triumph the Insult Comic Dog represents his co-star from that series. The series was initially picked up for 20 episodes, but when only 7 episodes had aired, in August 2015 Dino Stamatopoulos confirmed that it would not be returning. Plot The show is about two former child actors (Jack McBrayer and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog) who starred in a Lassie -like show from the 1980s and 1990s called Triumph's Boy . Jack had grown up playing the role of the small boy in the series even as he grew into adulthood. Though he is kind-hearted and optimistic, being a child actor had led to Jack being sheltered, naive, and socially awkward. After their show's cancellation, Jack and Triumph lived an indulgent and morally questionable lifestyle with the money they had made from the show. However, when Jack finds out that his parents had squandered all his earnings, he and Triumph are forced into a life of thievery and prostitution. This goes on until Jack decides to visit June Gregory, who played the role of his mother in Triumph's Boy . She agrees to take in both him and Triumph on the condition that Jack does not go back into acting and instead tries to get back on the straight and narrow path of a normal, Christian lifestyle. She grows ever more disdainful of Triumph, who continues to be a trouble-making nuisance, and eventually comes up with a plan to get rid of him. June arranges for Jack to go on a wilderness trip. Right after he leaves, she tells Triumph to get in the car because Pet Smart is having a sale on used kitty litter. She gives Triumph a handheld game to occupy him on the ride and drives to Montana, where she throws him into a ditch and abandons him. She gets home seconds before Jack returns from his trip and tells him that Triumph had left to get cigars and never came back. Over the course of 15 years, June helps teach Jack how to live a normal life while Triumph follows her scent back to her house, picking up many jobs along the way to sustain himself. Jack greets him warmly, but June fakes feeling ill and tells Jack to go get her medication. While Jack is upstairs, June and Triumph yell angrily at each other until they come to an agreement: Triumph will not tell Jack what June did to him as long as Triumph can stay and live with the two of them. Triumph is dead-set on getting Jack and himself back into",

His most iconic segments include mocking Star Wars fans camped outside a 2002 premiere, clashing with Eminem at the MTV Video Music Awards, and satirizing both major U.S. parties during multiple presidential campaigns—often getting ejected for his antics. Triumph’s Emmy-nominated 2016 election special, Grammy-nominated comedy album Come Poop with Me, and recurring appearances on The Late Show and The Daily Show cement his legacy as a fearless, foul-mouted satirist who weaponizes puppetry to lampoon celebrity worship, partisan politics, and nerd culture.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nTriumph the Insult Comic Dog, Robert Smigel, political satire, late-night comedy, puppet comedy",
