      "text": "The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set is a set of rulebooks for the Dungeons & Dragons ( D&D ) fantasy role-playing game . First published in 1977, it saw a handful of revisions and reprintings. The first edition was written by J. Eric Holmes based on Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson 's original work. Later editions were edited by Tom Moldvay , Frank Mentzer , Troy Denning , and Doug Stewart. The Basic Set details the essential concepts of the D&D game. It provides the rules for character creation and advancement for player characters at beginning levels . It also includes information on how to play adventures inside dungeons for both players and the Dungeon Master . 1977 version The original Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set was published by TSR, Inc. in 1977. TSR hired outside writer John Eric Holmes to produce the Basic Set as an introductory version of the D&D game. It incorporates game concepts from the original 1974 D&D boxed set plus Supplement I: Greyhawk . The rulebook is intended for characters of levels one through three, with rules for adventuring in dungeons, and introduces the main concepts of the game; it explains the game's concepts and method of play in terms that make them accessible to new players ages twelve and older who might not be familiar with the rules and structure of tabletop miniatures wargaming . Although the Basic Set was not fully compatible with Advanced Dungeons & Dragons , players were expected to continue play beyond third level by moving to AD&D , which was released beginning later that year. Holmes preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation, while Gary Gygax, who wrote the Advanced books, wanted an expansive game with rulings on any conceivable situation which might come up during play, and so could be used to arbitrate disputes at tournaments. The first Basic Set was available as a 48-page standalone rulebook featuring artwork by David C. Sutherland III , or as part of a boxed set , which was packaged in a larger, more visually appealing box than the original boxed set, allowing the game to be stocked on retail shelves and targeted at the general public via toy stores. The boxed set included a set of polyhedral dice and supplemental materials. In that same year, Games Workshop (U.K.) published their own version of the rulebook, with a cover by John Blanche , and illustrations by Fangorn. The boxed set contained geomorphs , lists of monsters and treasures, and a polyhedral dice set as supplemental materials. For a period in 1979, TSR experienced a dice shortage. Basic sets published during this time frame came with two sheets of numbered cutout cardstock chits that functioned in lieu of dice, along with a coupon for ordering dice from TSR. The rulebook also included a brief sample dungeon with a full-page map. Starting with the fourth printing in 1978, the two booklets of maps, encounter tables, and treasure lists were replaced",

Starting with the fourth printing in 1978, the two booklets of maps, encounter tables, and treasure lists were replaced with the module B1 In Search of the Unknown ; printings six through eleven (1979–1982) featured the module B2 The Keep on the Borderlands instead. Jon Peterson, for Polygon , highlighted that Dave Arneson sued TSR over Basic Set royalties in 1977 – Arneson was only being paid royalties for the Basic D&D rulebook included in the boxed set and was not paid for the \"cover price of the whole Basic Set \". Peterson wrote \"as Arneson's lawsuit loomed, TSR made a very pointed substitution to the contents of the Basic Set : they rotated out the Dungeon Geomorphs and Monster & Treasure Assortment booklets, replacing them with Mike Carr's In Search of the Unknown module. [...] It was a good idea to target a module at beginning dungeon masters — but it also had clear implications for the legal situation. Previously, when Arneson sought a 5% royalty on the whole contents of the Basic Set , he was effectively asking for money that was going into Gygax's pocket. Now, he would instead be asking for money earmarked for his friend Mike Carr\". Carr received royalties for In Search of the Unknown when the module was sold alone and when it was included in the Basic Set . After the September 1979 disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III , Dungeons & Dragons received \"mainstream notoriety. And with that, sales of the Basic Set rose dramatically. Right before the steam tunnel incident, the Basic Set might have sold 5,000 copies a month. By the end of 1979, it was trading over 30,000 copies per month, and only going up from there\". Following Carr's financial success due to his module being included in the boxed set, Gygax changed the module included with the Basic Set to Keep on the Borderlands which was a module he wrote. 1981 revision After the release of the AD&D game, the Basic Set saw a major revision in 1981 by editor Tom Moldvay . The game was not brought in line with AD&D but instead further away from that ruleset, and thus the basic D&D game became a separate and distinct product line from AD&D . The former was promoted as continuing the tone of original D&D , while AD&D was an advancement of the mechanics. The revised version of the set included a larger, sixty-four page rule book with a red border and a color cover by Erol Otus , the adventure B2 The Keep on the Borderlands , a set of six polyhedral dice, as well as a marking crayon. The book came drilled with holes so that it could",

Freeman gave this game an Overall Evaluation of \"Very Good\", concluding: \"It's still preferable to participate in an ongoing campaign, but if you must venture into RPG country without a guide, this is the first place to visit\". Clayton Miner reviewed the 1981 version of the Basic Set for Pegasus magazine #1 (1981). Miner commented that \"the book is a vast improvement over the earlier version. Better organization and well written rules are the main features of this edition\". Anders Swenson and Douglas Law reviewed the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set and Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"the new D&D Basic and Expert Sets should be a smooth introduction to the hobby of adventure-game playing for vast numbers of new players and an enjoyable addition to the libraries of experienced players. We recommend this version of the game over the previous editions, especially for beginners, because it is clearer, better organized, and more refined\".

Games magazine included Dungeons & Dragons, Basic Set in their \"Top 100 Games of 1982\", describing it as \"more than a game, it's a cooperative exercise limited only by the players' imaginations. For advanced players there are dozens of excellent supplemental books, adventures, and playing aids\". Doug Cowie reviewed the 1983 version of the Basic Set for Imagine magazine and gave it a positive review. According to Cowie, while the rules stay the same, thus allowing those with the older version to continue using their sets, the presentation has changed. He approved of the fact that \"at long last\", a game company released a product that explains to someone new to role-playing games how to get started. Cowie ended his review by stating that \"Basic is a lot closer to the spirit of the original game than is the rambling, unwieldy and sometimes pompous Advanced\" and that \"for one-off dungeon type games I would recommend Basic to anyone, beginner and veteran alike\". Ken Rolston reviewed Dungeons & Dragons: Basic Rules Set 1 for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"Is the Basic Rules Set complete? Technically yes - the package contains ample material for many hours of gaming. However, the Expert Rules are really necessary if a regular gaming group develops. Personal observation indicates that young players will go through the set's three character levels in no time at all, and the gamemaster will certainly want access to high er level rules to handle the non-play er character antagonists in his adventures.

It was the Crimson Tide's 19th overall and 16th season as a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA). The team was led by head coach D. V. Graves , in his first year, and played their home games at the University of Alabama Quad in Tuscaloosa and the Birmingham Fairgrounds in Birmingham , Alabama . They finished the season with a record of five wins, two losses and two ties (5–2–2 overall, 2–2–2 in the SIAA). In June 1911, Guy Lowman resigned from his position of head coach and athletic director at Alabama, and one month later the hiring of Graves to serve in both capacities was announced by the university president. Under Graves, Alabama opened their season with a pair of victories over Howard and Birmingham College at Tuscaloosa. They were then upset by Georgia at Birmingham before playing both Mississippi A&M and Georgia Tech to ties on the road. After a victory over Marion Military Institute in their final road game of the season, Alabama closed the season with victories over both Tulane and Davidson and an upset loss to Sewanee . Schedule Before the season On June 21, 1911, Kansas State Agricultural College (now known as Kansas State University ) announced Alabama head coach and athletic director Guy Lowman had been hired to serve in the same capacities at Kansas State. After a month-long search, on July 21, university president John Abercrombie offered the job of professor of physical training and athletic director to D. V. Graves to which he accepted immediately via telegraph . The appointment was inclusive of him serving as head coach of all athletic teams at Alabama, including football. Graves was selected as he was the most highly recommended candidate, and he also played baseball for a single-season under Lowman while in college at the University of Missouri .

After a scoreless third, Alabama then closed the game with a trio of fourth quarter touchdowns. Robert Bumgardner scored first on a five-yard run, Moody on a one-yard run and Charlie Joplin on a 65-yard reception. The victory brought Alabama's all-time record against Howard to 4–0.

      "text": "South African PhD graduate (on the right, wearing a ceremonial gown) Detailed requirements for the award of a PhD degree vary throughout the world and even from school to school. It is usually required for the student to hold an Honours degree or a Master's degree with high academic standing, in order to be considered for a PhD program.  In the US, Canada, India, Sweden and Denmark, for example, many universities require coursework in addition to research for PhD degrees. In other countries (such as the UK) there is generally no such condition, though this varies by university and field. Some individual universities or departments specify additional requirements for students not already in possession of a bachelor's degree or equivalent or higher. In order to submit a successful PhD admission application, copies of academic transcripts, letters of recommendation, a research proposal, and a personal statement are often required. Most universities also invite for a special interview before admission. A candidate must submit a project, thesis, or dissertation often consisting of a body of original academic research, which is in principle worthy of publication in a peer-reviewed context. Moreover, some PhD programs, especially in science, require one to three published articles in peer-reviewed journals. In many countries, a candidate must defend this work before a panel of expert examiners appointed by the university; this defense is open to the public in some countries, and held in private in others; in other countries, the dissertation is examined by a panel of expert examiners who stipulate whether the dissertation is in principle passable and any issues that need to be addressed before the dissertation can be passed. Some universities in the non- English -speaking world have begun adopting similar standards to those of the anglophone PhD degree for their research doctorates (see the Bologna process ). A PhD student or candidate is conventionally required to study on campus under close supervision. With the popularity of distance education and e-learning technologies, some universities now accept students enrolled into a distance education part-time mode. In a \" sandwich PhD \" program, PhD candidates do not spend their entire study period at the same university. Instead, the PhD candidates spend the first and last periods of the program at their home universities and in between conduct research at another institution or field research . Occasionally a \"sandwich PhD\" will be awarded by two universities. It is possible to broaden the field of study pursued by a PhD student by the addition of a minor subject of study within a different discipline. Value and criticism A career in academia generally requires a PhD, although in some countries it is possible to reach relatively high positions without a doctorate. In North America, professors are increasingly being required to have a PhD, and the percentage of faculty with a PhD may be used as a university ratings measure. The motivation may also include increased salary, but in many cases, this is not the result. Research by Bernard H. Casey of the University of Warwick, U.K, suggests that, over all subjects, PhDs provide an earnings",

      "text": "Dungeons & Dragons Immortals Rules , written by Frank Mentzer , is a boxed set for the Dungeons & Dragons ( D&D ) fantasy role-playing game first published by TSR in 1986 as an expansion to the Basic Set . Publication history The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set was revised in 1983 by Frank Mentzer as Dungeons & Dragons Set 1: Basic Rules . Between 1983 and 1985, the system was revised and expanded by Mentzer as a series of five boxed sets, including: the Basic Rules (supporting character levels 1–3), Expert Rules (supporting levels 4–14), Companion Rules (supporting levels 15–25), Master Rules (supporting levels 26–36), and Immortals Rules (supporting Immortals—characters who had transcended levels). The Immortals Rules set contains two booklets: one is fifty-two pages long and the other is thirty-two pages. The booklets, Player's Guide to Immortals and DM's Guide to Immortals , were written by Frank Mentzer and edited by Anne Gray McCready , with cover artwork by Larry Elmore , and interior illustrations by Elmore and Jeff Easley . Harold Johnson also had a role in editing and development. Contents Immortals Rules is a supplement intended for player characters after successfully completing the requirements for achieving immortality as detailed in the Master Rules . This set adds a system in which characters that attain immortality exchange all of their experience points for power points at a rate of ten thousand to one. Players can spend these power points to permanently increase attribute scores, and to use a magic point system to give the character new special abilities. Immortals advance in ranks instead of levels; a character must keep enough power points to maintain a rank, and will need to compete in the Olympics to get promoted to the next rank. The combat and magic systems have been modified to account for Immortal powers. Each Immortal player character has an abundance of powers, literally able to cast any magic spell in addition to new combat abilities. The rules detail playing transhuman Immortal characters, and cover their powers, artifacts, and relationships with each other, as well as their ability to construct their own personal \"home planes\". The set also presents powerful new monsters, and suggestions for adventure scenarios. The set describes the history of Immortals within the D&D game: once there were only three Immortals, who discovered the multiverse , and decided to give it order and purpose. This set expands the D&D multiverse system, with an Astral Plane that permeates and connects the whole of the multiverse. In addition to the Astral Plane, there are also the Prime Material Plane , elemental planes, the Ethereal Planes , and many outer planes; these outer planes range from mono-spatial atto-planes (about 1/3\" big) to penta-spatial tera-planes",
