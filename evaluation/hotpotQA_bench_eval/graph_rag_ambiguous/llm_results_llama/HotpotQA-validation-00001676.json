      "text": "Sonerila is a genus of plants in the family Melastomataceae . This genus is characterized the by presence of three petals (along with the genera Stussenia and Lithobium ) as opposed to five in the other members of the family. Most members of the genus prefer growing in shady habitats. It is a large genus including about 175 species. This is primarily an Asiatic genus of the tropical and subtropical regions distributed from India and Sri Lanka to the Indo-Pacific . The members of the group are generally herbs or under shrubs, including some stemless members. Leaves opposite, leaf margin entire or serrulate. Inflorescence usually scorpioid cymes. Flowers in most species purple, some members with reddish or white flowers. Stamens 3, (in one whorl) or rarely 6 (in two whorls). Ovary inferior, 3-celled. Many species of this genus have restricted distribution and very small populations and would thus be regarded as Vulnerable (VU) or Endangered (EN) based on IUCN Red List criteria though this taxon has not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List.

      "text": "Apiaceae ( / ˌ eɪ p i ˈ eɪ s i . iː , - ˌ aɪ / ⓘ ), also called Umbelliferae , is a family of mostly aromatic flowering plants named after the type genus Apium , and commonly known as the celery , carrot , or parsley family , or simply as umbellifers . It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,800 species in about 446 genera , including such well-known, and economically important plants as ajwain , angelica , anise , asafoetida , caraway , carrot , celery , chervil , coriander , cumin , dill , fennel , lovage , cow parsley , parsley , parsnip and sea holly , as well as silphium , a plant whose exact identity is unclear and which may be extinct. The family Apiaceae includes a significant number of phototoxic species, such as giant hogweed , and a smaller number of highly poisonous species, such as poison hemlock , water hemlock , spotted cowbane , fool's parsley , and various species of water dropwort . Description Most Apiaceae are annual , biennial or perennial herbs (frequently with the leaves aggregated toward the base), though a minority are woody shrubs or small trees such as Bupleurum fruticosum . Their leaves are of variable size, and alternately arranged , or with the upper leaves becoming nearly opposite. The leaves may be petiolate or sessile . There are no stipules but the petioles are frequently sheathing, and the leaves may be perfoliate . The leaf blade is usually dissected, ternate , or pinnatifid , but simple, and entire in some genera, e.g. Bupleurum . Commonly, their leaves emit a marked smell when crushed, aromatic to fetid, but absent in some species. The defining characteristic of this family is the inflorescence , the flowers nearly always aggregated in terminal umbels , that may be simple or more commonly compound, often umbelliform cymes . The flowers are usually perfect ( hermaphroditic ), and actinomorphic , but there may be zygomorphic flowers at the edge of the umbel, as in carrot ( Daucus carota ) and coriander , with petals of unequal size, the ones pointing outward from the umbel larger than the ones pointing inward. Some are andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or even dioecious (as in Acronema ), with a distinct calyx , and corolla , but the calyx is often highly reduced, to the point of being undetectable in many species, while the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or purple. The flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous , with five petals",

      "text": "Chamelaucium , also known as waxflower , is a genus of shrubs endemic to south western Western Australia . They belong to the myrtle family Myrtaceae and have flowers similar to those of the tea-trees ( Leptospermum ). The most well-known species is the Geraldton wax, Chamelaucium uncinatum , which is cultivated widely for its large attractive flowers. Description Plants of the genus Chamelaucium are woody evergreen shrubs ranging from 15 cm (6 in) to 3 m (10 ft) high. The leaves are tiny to medium-sized and arranged oppositely on the stems. They contain oil glands and are aromatic, often giving off a pleasant aroma when crushed. The flowers are small and have five petals, ten stamens, and are followed by small hardened fruit. Taxonomy The genus was first defined by French botanist René Louiche Desfontaines in 1819. The derivation of the name is unclear. They are commonly known as waxplants, or wax flowers from the waxy feel of the petals. Fourteen species are currently recognised within the genus. It gives its name to a number of closely related genera, collectively known as the Chamelaucium alliance within the family Myrtaceae; larger members include Verticordia , Calytrix , Darwinia , Micromyrtus , Thryptomene and Baeckea .

      "text": "Vanilla orchids form the flowering plant genus Vanilla made of about 110 species in the orchid family ( Orchidaceae ). These orchids are found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, from tropical America to tropical Asia , New Guinea and West Africa . Five species are known from the contiguous United States, all limited to southern Florida. The most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla ( V. planifolia ), native to Mexico and Belize, from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived. It is the only orchid widely used for industrial purposes in flavoring such products as foods, beverages and cosmetics, and is recognized as the most popular aroma and flavor . The key constituent imparting its flavour is the phenolic aldehyde vanillin . The genus was established in 1754 by Plumier, after J. Miller. The word vanilla , derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina ( vaina itself meaning sheath or pod), simply translates as little pod. Description Flat-leaved vanilla ( Vanilla planifolia ) habitus This genus of vine -like plants has a monopodial climbing habitus . They can form long thin stems with a length of more than 35 m, with alternate leaves spread along their length. The short, oblong, dark green leaves of Vanilla are thick and leathery, even fleshy in some species. But there are also a significant number of species that have their leaves reduced to scales or have become nearly or totally leafless and appear to use their green climbing stems for photosynthesis . Long and strong aerial roots grow from each node. Vanilla plantations require trees for the orchids to climb and anchor by its roots. Flowers and fruit The racemose inflorescence 's short-lived flowers arise successively on short peduncles from the leaf axils or scales. There may be up to 100 flowers on a single raceme, but usually no less than 20. The flowers are quite large and attractive with white, green, greenish yellow or cream colors. The flowers' sepals and petals are similar. The lip is tubular-shaped and surrounds the long, bristly column , opening up, as the bell of a trumpet, at its apex. The anther is at the top of the column and hangs over the stigma , separated by the rostellum. Most Vanilla flowers have a sweet scent. Blooming occurs only when the flowers are fully grown. Each flower opens up in the morning and closes late in the afternoon on the same day, never to reopen. If pollination has not occurred meanwhile, it will be shed. The flowers are self-fertile, but need pollinators to perform this task. Pollinated flowers produces elongate, fleshy and later dehiscent capsule fruits 10–20 cm long with watery pulp ; the fruit ripens gradually for 8 to 9 months after flowering, eventually turning black in color and giving",

      "text": "Aspidistra / ˌ æ s p ɪ ˈ d ɪ s t r ə / is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae , subfamily Convallarioideae , native to eastern and southeastern Asia, particularly China and Vietnam . They grow in shade under trees and shrubs. Their leaves arise more or less directly from ground level, where their flowers also appear. The number of species known has increased considerably from the 1980s onwards, with around 100 accepted as of July 2013 [update] . Aspidistra elatior is common worldwide as a foliage house plant that is very tolerant of neglect. It and other species can also be grown in shade outside, where they are generally hardy to −15 °C (5 °F). Description Species of Aspidistra are perennial herbaceous plants growing from rhizomes . The leaves are either solitary or are grouped in small \"tufts\" of two to four. They arise more or less directly from the rhizome, rather than being borne on stems. Each leaf has a long stalk ( petiole ) and a blade with many veins. The flowering stem ( scape ) is usually very short so that the flowers appear low down among the leaves. The fleshy flowers are bell-, urn- or cup-shaped. They vary considerably in size and shape, although few are showy. The flowers of A. longipedunculata are yellow and, unusually for the genus, are borne on scapes up to 20 cm (8 in) high. A. grandiflora has spider-like flowers up to 12 cm (5 in) across. The flower has a large stigma with a flattened top. The fruit is a berry , often with a single seed. Taxonomy The genus Aspidistra was named by the English botanist John Ker Gawler in 1822, as a blend of Greek ασπίς/ασπίδ- aspid- , meaning shield, and the name of the sister genus Tupistra . The genus was at one time placed in a broadly defined Liliaceae, along with many other lilioid monocots . It has also been placed in the families Convallariaceae and Ruscaceae. The APG III system of 2009 places it in the family Asparagaceae , subfamily Convallarioideae . Species Aspidistra is a genus that was largely ignored by field botanists until the 1980s onwards, and there has been a rapid rise in the number of recognised species since then. Some 8 to 10 species were known in the late 1970s; 30 new species were described from China in the 1980s. Subsequently, more new species were found in Vietnam.

The genus was established by Linnaeus in 1753 containing 14 species, however, of those original species, only four are still retained in Othonna , while the others have been transferred to different genera including Cineraria , Euryops , Hertia , Ligularia , Senecio , and Tephroseris . The genus Othonnna is known to be monophyletic. In 2012, a new genus Crassothonna B. Nord. was erected with 13 species transferred from Othonna . A complete modern taxonomic treatment of the genus is being undertaken by the Compton Herbarium and the South African National Biodiversity Institute . The first part, a revision of the Othonnna bulbosa group (those species that are geophytic with an aerial stem), was published in 2019. The name Othonna is derived from the Ancient Greek ὄθοννα and the Latin othone, which is a linen cloth or napkin, in allusion to the downy covering of some of the earlier known species.

      "text": "Silene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae . Containing nearly 900 species, it is the largest genus in the family. Common names include campion and catchfly . Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Scientific history Members of this genus have been the subject of research by preeminent plant ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists, including Charles Darwin , Gregor Mendel , Carl Correns , Herbert G. Baker , and Janis Antonovics . Many Silene species continue to be widely used to study systems, particularly in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. The genus has been used as a model for understanding the genetics of sex determination for over a century. Silene species commonly contain a mixture of hermaphroditic and female (or male-sterile) individuals ( gynodioecy ), and early studies by Correns showed that male sterility could be maternally inherited, an example of what is now known as cytoplasmic male sterility . Two independent groups of species in Silene have evolved separate male and female sexes ( dioecy ) with chromosomal sex determination that is analogous to the system found in humans and other mammals. Silene flowers are frequently visited by flies, such as Rhingia campestris . Silene species have also been used to study speciation, host-pathogen interactions, biological species invasions, adaptation to heavy-metal-contaminated soils, metapopulation genetics, and organelle genome evolution. Notably, some members of the genus Silene hold the distinction of harboring the largest mitochondrial genomes ever identified. Taxonomy Silene was originally described by Linnaeus . Divisions of the genus into subgenera or sections before 2003 do not seem to be well-supported by molecular evidence. The genus Lychnis is closely related to (and sometimes included in) Silene . When treated as a distinct genus, it can often be differentiated by the number of flower styles (five in Lychnis' and three in Silene ), the number of teeth of the seed capsule (five in Lychnis' and six in Silene ), and by the sticky stems of Lychnis . Sexual systems Sexual systems vary across species. Most Silene species are hermaphroditic representing 58.2% of Silene species, 14.3% are dioecious , 13.3% gynodioecious , and 12.2% are both gynodioecious and gynomonoecious . Trioecy , andromonoecy , and gynomonoecy have also been reported but are extremely rare.
