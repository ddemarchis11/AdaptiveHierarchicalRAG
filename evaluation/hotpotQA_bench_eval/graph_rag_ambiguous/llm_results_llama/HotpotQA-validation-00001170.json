      "text": "Naked Weapon (赤裸特工) is a 2002 Hong Kong action-thriller film directed by action choreographer Tony Ching , starring Maggie Q , Anya Wu and Daniel Wu . Written by film producer Wong Jing , Naked Weapon is similar in theme though unrelated to his earlier work Naked Killer (1992). The film revolves around three assassins who get close to their targets, primarily through seduction, before they kill them. The film grossed HK$ 72,828 in the first week of release in Hong Kong but quickly dropped in the subsequent month, therefore a box-office bomb . Plot The movie opens with the assassination of a man of unknown identity. A team of three CIA officers, including rookie Jack Chen ( Daniel Wu ), watch through surveillance as an assassin named Fiona Birch (Marit Thoresen) enters the man's heavily guarded apartment suite and, after having sex with him, kills him by breaking his spine with her bare hands during a massage. As she makes her escape, Fiona's car is hit by a rocket. As the CIA officers rush over to extricate her from the wreckage, they are shot and killed by a woman in a limousine, leaving Jack as the only survivor. The woman in the limousine is revealed to be Madam M ( Almen Wong ), the leader of a mysterious assassin organization. After the incident, young girls across the globe start disappearing one after another. The only relationship among them is that they are all trained in martial arts or sports. As Jack correctly theorizes, these girls have been abducted by Madam M and transported to an island to be trained to become professional assassins. After six years of gruesome training, only Charlene Ching ( Maggie Q ), Katt ( Anya Wu ) and Jing ( Jewel Lee ) survive and \"graduate.\" The last test in order for them to graduate was a fight to the death test. Katt and Charlene, being friends, could not kill each other, and so each is accepted as a survivor. To celebrate, Madam M gives them all wines that have drugs in them. As the drugs take effect, Madam M calls her guards to rape the girls, thus (in Madam M's words) making them ready for what was to come. The three girls are then sent on several missions around the world. During one of her missions in Hong Kong, Charlene runs into her long-lost mother, Faye Ching ( Cheng Pei-pei ). Jack tracks Charlene down, but Charlene manages to knock him out and escape. Believing she would return to see her mother, Jack waits outside Faye's house. However, Jing arrives before Charlene and stabs Faye. Jack tries to fend her off but fails. Charlene shows up and kills Jing after a fierce fight. She and Jack then escort the wounded Faye to the hospital. To regain their freedom, Charlene and Katt accept",

A yakuza boss, Ryuichi ( Andrew Lin ), has contracted Madam M to eliminate a traitor in his gang.

Unraced as a two-year-old, he showed promising form in Britain in 2011 before being sold to race in Hong Kong. He continued to show useful but unexceptional form before emerging as a dominant middle-distance performer in the early part of 2013, winning the January Cup , Hong Kong Gold Cup , Premier Plate , Queen Elizabeth II Cup and Singapore Airlines International Cup . In July 2013 at the Hong Kong Jockey Club Champion Awards , he won three awards including the title of Hong Kong Horse of the Year .

However, following multiple index adjustments, its weighting gradually declined to 4.72% as of June 2025. According to provisional statistics from the Insurance Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission for Hong Kong's long-term insurance and investment securities business from January to December 2017, AIA has over 3 million customers. It is the insurance and investment securities company with the most policies in Hong Kong, meaning roughly one in every four Hong Kong residents with medical insurance or investment securities is an AIA Hong Kong customer. Additionally, combined membership of MDRT (Million Dollar Round Table) in AIA Hong Kong and AIA Macau ranked first for the 17th consecutive year. History AIA traces its roots to 19 December 1918 when Cornelius Vander Starr founded what was then known as American Asiatic Underwriters in Shanghai , China (later American International Underwriters). Starr eventually expanded his business throughout the world. On 21 January 1939, Starr relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York City after the Japanese invasion of China and again on 5 April 1949 with the communist takeover of mainland China, and the Chinese AIA became a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG). On 1 December 2009, AIG sold preferred equity interests in two newly formed international life insurance subsidiaries, American International Assurance Company, Limited (AIA) and American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to reduce its debt by US$25 billion. AIA had planned to be a listed company in Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Securities and Futures Commission on 3 April 2010. However, on 2 March 2010, Prudential PLC , a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), which at the time was the world's third largest IPO ever (currently sixth as of June 2023). On 11 September 2012, AIA acquired a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). AIA also entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network.

It is located in Central , not far from the landmark Bank of China Tower . The Furama Kempinski Hotel , famous for its revolving restaurant, formerly stood on the same lot that the former AIG Tower rises from, but in December 2001, the 33-storey hotel was demolished to make way for the AIG Tower. The tower was renamed to AIA Central on 9 July 2009. The building was jointly developed by Lai Sun Development , CapitaLand , and American International Group (AIG). The architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed the building to look like the Chinese junk , a Chinese sailboat design dating from ancient times and still in use today. Leslie E. Robertson Associates are the structural engineers for this project. As well they included a pedestrian bridge linking the tower to the Hong Kong elevated walkway network. The building has approximately 41,777 m² (450,000 ft²) of office accommodation. Plot history The 999-year leasehold site has an area of 24,427 square feet (2,269 m 2 ). Lai Sun Development (\"LSD\"), founded by textiles magnate Lim Por-yen , paid HK$7 billion for Furama Hotel Enterprises in June 1997. Lai Sun, which already owned the Ritz-Carlton Hotel next door, acquired a 45.42 per cent stake for $3.13 billion, and made a general offer at $33.50 for each remaining shares at a total cost of $6.893 billion. LSD intended to combine the two plots into a prime office block. Then the Asian financial crisis struck, plunging the entire group into distress and forced asset sales. In March 2000, LSD announced that a 65% stake in the Furama Hotel would be sold to a 50:50 joint venture between Pidemco and AIG for HK$1.88 billion. Pidemco, the largest owner of commercial properties in Singapore, is part of Singapore Technologies, controlled by Temasek Holdings . As part of the deal, Lai Sun would continue to operate the hotel until its redevelopment. The Furama Hotel closed in November, and was demolished in December 2001. Following the demolition of the Furama Hotel, the construction of the new tower AIA Central commenced in November 2002. AIA Central is a 37-storey grade A office building with a gross floor area of approximately 41,777 square metres. It provides 26 floors of prime office space, each of some",

Early issues featured varied colors and sizes until a partial standardization in 1970 when red became the dominant color across issuers. Note-issuing banks evolved over time, with Mercantile ceasing in 1974 and Bank of China joining in 1994, ultimately leading to a uniform red design for all $100 notes.\n\n**Keywords**: Hong Kong currency, $100 banknote, banknote issuers, numismatics, monetary history",

Personal favorites—*Citizen Kane*, *La Dolce Vita*, *The Third Man*—reflected his admiration for morally complex, humanistic storytelling. Even after cancer left him unable to speak, he continued writing passionate, star-rated reviews that balanced intellect with emotional honesty until his death in 2013.  \n\n**Keywords:**  \nfilm criticism, animation advocacy, black-and-white aesthetics, emotional honesty, Life Itself",
