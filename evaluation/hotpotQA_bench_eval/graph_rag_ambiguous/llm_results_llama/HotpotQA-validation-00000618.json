      "text": "The Pennacook , also known by the names Penacook and Pennacock , were Algonquian Indigenous people who lived in what is now Massachusetts , New Hampshire , and southern Maine . They were not a united tribe but a network of politically and culturally allied communities. Penacook was also the name of a specific Native village in what is now Concord, New Hampshire . The Pennacook were related to but not a part of the original Wabanaki Confederacy , which includes the Miꞌkmaq , Maliseet , Passamaquoddy , and Penobscot peoples. Name Pennacook is also written as Penacook and Pennacock. The name Pennacook roughly translates (based on Abenaki cognates) as \"at the bottom of the hill.\" Territory Historian David Stewart-Smith suggests that the Penacook were Central Abenaki people. Their southern neighbors were the Massachusett and Wampanoag . Pennacook territory bordered the Connecticut River in the West, Lake Winnipesauke in the north, the Piscataqua to the east, and the villages of the closely allied Pawtucket confederation along the southern Merrimack River to the south. The Pennacook homeland was built around the upper Merrimack and the major towns at Amoskeag Falls (now Manchester) and Pennacook (now Concord ), which served as major population hubs and later fallback centers for people across the region during the colonial period. Confederacy The Pennacook were a loose and fluid confederacy of village communities. Pennacook was a specific community within this confederacy that also included Accominta, Agawam , Amoskeag, Coosuc , Cowasack , Nashua , Naumkeag , Newickawanoc, Ossipee , Piscataway , Piscatequa, Souhegan, Squamscot, Wambesit, Washacum, Winnepesaukee, Wachusett, and other villages. The children of Pennacook Sachem Passaconaway intermarried with the children of Pawtucket Bashaba Nanepashemet in the 17th century.  Because decisions to ally and become a part of such alliances were largely in the hands of the leaders of individual bands, the membership of these confederations and alliances fluctuated regularly. Subsistence Pennacook people were semi-sedentary. Families and bands had permanent claims to territory, and their hierarchical political structure from locally representative sagamores to more regionally representative sachems was fundamentally democratic and designed to reduce conflict and provide social stability. Leaders and sachems like Passaconaway played important roles in organizing long-distance kin and trade networks with allied neighbors (his own children were all married to the children of allied political leaders).

      "text": "The Lochmere Archeological District is a large archeological area on the banks of the Winnipesaukee River in Belknap County, New Hampshire , near the village of Lochmere . The area, part of which is now preserved by the state as the Brennick Lochmere Archaeological Site , is a multi-component site with evidence of human occupation from the Middle Archaic through the Late Woodland periods. The site was occupied in historic times by the Winnipesaukee sub-tribe of the Pennacook people, and is near Aquadoctan (aka The Weirs), one of the largest native towns of prehistoric New Hampshire. The district also encompasses a number of archaeologically sensitive historic sites that were developed by white settlers and later residents to take advantage of the river's water power for industrial purposes. These uses began as early as the 1770s and continued into the 19th century, when the proprietors of the area's mills contested with the wealthier owners of downstream mills in Manchester, New Hampshire , Lowell, Massachusetts , and other sites on the Merrimack River for control over the river's flow. These well-funded interests eventually purchased all of the major water rights in the area, and shut the smaller area mills down, and by 1882 most of them lay in ruins. About 90 acres (36 ha) of the area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, an area that includes 13 prehistoric and 18 historic sites. Some of the archaeologically sensitive areas have been partially compromised by home construction in the area, and by the state in the dredging and widening the river channel.

      "text": "An illustration of the Nodena site in northeastern Arkansas . Artist H. Roe Pacaha was a Native American polity encountered in 1541 by the Hernando de Soto expedition. This group inhabited fortified villages in what is today the northeastern portion of the U.S. state of Arkansas . The tribe takes its name from the chieftain Pacaha (born in the early 16th century), who ruled the tribe from its primary village on the Mississippi River , which was thought to be located in present-day Crittenden County, Arkansas near Turrell . The site, part of the Nodena phase , is known to archaeologists as \"The Bradley Site\". Information about Chief Pacaha and his people comes from journals made during the expedition of Hernando De Soto in 1541. The de Soto expedition stayed at Pacaha's village for approximately 40 days. De Soto expedition The initial encounter between the Pacaha and the de Soto expedition was violent. Chief Pacaha's tribe had been at war for some time with a neighboring chieftain named Casqui . The Casqui tribe is thought to have lived at a site near Parkin, Arkansas , which is the location of the present-day Parkin Archeological State Park . A map showing the de Soto expedition route through Mississippi , and Arkansas , up to the point de Soto dies. Based on the Charles M. Hudson map of 1997. De Soto had encountered the Casqui tribe first. When he pressed on to visit the Pacaha village, many of the Casqui people followed him. Many of the Pacaha, seeing the approach of their enemy, attempted to flee to an island in the river and drowned. The Casqui who accompanied de Soto sacked the village, desecrated holy sites, and looted valuables. The Pacaha controlled more territory and had a larger population than the Casqui. Chief Pacaha was younger than the Casqui chief, however, and seemingly had more to lose from the continued aggressive Casqui attacks. De Soto contacted Chief Pacaha and convinced him that he had nothing to do with the attack and that the expedition's intentions were peaceful. De Soto assured the Pacaha that the expedition would help the Pacaha attack the Casqui to punish them for their subterfuge. The Casqui received advance warning of the planned attack. They returned the looted items and apologized in order to stave off retribution. De Soto arranged a dinner for the two leaders and a peace treaty between the tribes. Chief Pacaha presented de Soto with one of his wives, one of his sisters, and another woman from his tribe. This action was in gratitude for the arrangement of peace and also to outdo his rival, who had only presented a daughter to de Soto. The Hernando de Soto expedition records are the only historical records of Chief Pacaha and his tribe. Their later history is",

Situated close to Ganderbal , the lake is connected with the famous Dal Lake via a channel, \"Amir Khan Nallah,\" which passes through Gilsar and Khushal Sar . The lake is in a highly deteriorated condition. In case of flooding, the excessive water of the Dal is diverted here. The Shallabugh Wetland is fed by water from the Sind River and Anchar Lake. Deterioration Once a popular tourist destination, as tourists on shikaras and houseboats used to travel here from Dal Lake, over the years it has deteriorated owing to pollution , large-scale encroachment , and illegal constructions in its surroundings. In the 1990s, when the Nallah Mar was covered to build the Mearplan highway around the western side of Dal, six-foot pipes were laid under the new road to allow Dal to continue to drain into the Anchar lake system, however, the pipes soon clogged due to waste and debris.

Chandra Taal is near the source of the Chandra River . Despite the rugged and inhospitable surroundings, it is in a protected niche with some flowers and wildlife in summer. It is a favourite spot for tourists and high-altitude trekkers. It is usually associated with Spiti , although geographically it lies in the watershed of the Chandra River of Lahaul. Kunzum La separates Lahaul and Spiti valleys. It's surrounded by the Chandratal Wildlife Sanctuary . Description A view of the lake, Jul 2024 Chandra Taal Lake is on the Samudra Tapu plateau, which overlooks the Chandra River (a source river of the Chenab ). The name of the lake originates from its crescent shape. It is at an altitude of about 4,300 metres (14,100 ft) in the Himalayas . Mountains of scree overlook the lake on one side, and a cirque encloses it on the other. Access Foot path to Chandra Taal, Aug 2016 Chandra Taal is a tourist destination for trekkers and campers. The lake is accessible by road from Batal and by road as well as on foot from Kunzum Pass from late May to early October. The road to Chandra Taal branches off from NH-505 about 2.9 kilometres (1.8 mi) from Batal and 8 km (5.0 mi) from Kunzum Pass. This 12 km (7.5 mi) motor road runs as far as a parking lot 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from the lake. One has to travel on foot for the final 1 km (0.62 mi). It takes approximately two hours from Kunzum Pass to Chandra Taal. Chandra Taal is also accessible from Suraj Tal , 30 km (19 mi) away. Fauna and flora Herd of sheep passing the lake, Jul 2016 There are vast meadows on the banks of the lake. During springtime, these meadows are carpeted with hundreds of varieties of wild flowers. In 1871, Harcourt, Assistant Commissioner of Kullu, reported that there was a plain of good grass to the north of Chadra Taal, where shepherds brought large herds for grazing from Kullu and Kangra . Due to overgrazing, the grasslands are now degraded. Ruddy (Brahminy) shelduck, Jun 2018 Vegetation around the lake, Jul 2024 Chandra Taal is home to a few species such as the Snow Leopard , Snow Cock , Chukor, Black Ring Stilt, Kestrel , Golden Eagle , Chough,",

It is the third-highest lake in India and the 21st-highest in the world. Suraj Tal Lake is just below the source of the Bhaga River that joins the Chandra River downstream at Tandi to form the Chandrabhaga River in Himachal Pradesh. The Chandrabhaga River is known as the Chenab as it enters the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir . The other major tributary of the Chandrabhaga, the Chandra, originates and flows south-east of the Bara-lacha La. Access Suraj Tal is 65 km (40 mi) from Keylong , the district headquarters of the Lahaul Spiti district . It is accessible by National Highway NH 21, also known as the Leh-Manali Highway . The road skirts Suraj Tal, which is just 3 km (1.9 mi) short of the Bara-lacha-la pass. It remains inaccessible during the winter months of November to April since the pass becomes totally snowbound during this period.

The pass is 8 km long and is also called the \"Pass with Crossroads on Summit\" since roads from Zanskar , Ladakh , Spiti, and Lahaul meet at this pass. In addition to the Bhaga River that originates from it and flows through Suraj Tal, Bara-lacha-la Pass is also the source of the Chandra and Yunan Rivers in the southeast and north, respectively. The lake is situated in the Upper Himalayan Zone, or High Latitudinal Zone part of the Himalayas which has very sparse population with climatic conditions akin to polar conditions. Snowfall in this zone, though scanty, is reported to be spread throughout the year. Rainfall is rare in the region. Snow precipitation from snow storms is reported to be less than 200 mm (7.9 in) of snow in nearly 50% of the storms, even though one observatory in the region has reported 800 mm (31 in) of snowfall. The precipitation starts melting in May. Snow on slopes is generally slackly bonded, with the wind redistributing it. The average total snowfall recorded in a year is reported to be 12–15 m (39–49 ft), with the highest temperature at 13 °C (55 °F), the mean highest temperature at 0.5 °C",

The Lakes Region of New Hampshire is located in the east-central part of the state, south of the White Mountains Region and extending to the Maine border. It is named for the numerous lakes in the region, the largest of which are Lake Winnipesaukee , Lake Winnisquam , Squam Lake , and Newfound Lake . The area comprises all of Belknap County , the southern portion of Carroll County , the eastern portion of Grafton County , and the northern portions of Strafford County and Merrimack County . The largest municipality is the city of Laconia . Besides the lakes, there are also two small mountain ranges, the Belknap Mountains which lie to the southwest, and the Ossipee Mountains to the northeast. The area is a popular tourist destination in the summer time, with the activity peaking during the annual Motorcycle Week and races at Loudon's New Hampshire Motor Speedway . Other tourist destinations include Funspot in Weirs Beach , the Squam Lakes Natural Science Center in Holderness , the children's museum of Center Harbor , Gunstock ski resort and Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion at Meadowbrook , both in Gilford, Castle in the Clouds in Moultonborough , and the town of Wolfeboro , which claims to be the nation's oldest resort town. Lake Winnipesaukee is the largest lake in the state, and is home to numerous vacation homes. Several motion pictures have either been filmed or set in the region, including the 1981 classic, On Golden Pond (filmed on Squam Lake in the town of Holderness ) and the 1991 comedy What About Bob? , which was filmed in Virginia but (fictitiously) took place in Wolfeboro.

Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians (pronounced \"Soo Saint Marie\", Ojibwe : Baawiting Anishinaabeg ), commonly shortened to Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians or the more colloquial Soo Tribe , is a federally recognized Native American tribe in what is now known as Michigan 's Upper Peninsula . The tribal headquarters is located within Sault Ste. Marie , the major city in the region, which is located on the St. Marys River. Originally a part of the homelands of the Oc̣eṭi Ṡakowiƞ (Dakota, Lakota, Nakoda, or Sioux), who were pushed westward by the Anishinaabe Migration from the east coast, this location became known as Bawating by the Anishinaabe (the Ojibwe or Chippewa), who arrived there before Europeans showed up in the mid-to-late 16th century. Bawating , sometimes seen written as Baawiting or Bahweting , is an Ojibwe word meaning \"The Gathering Place.\" The Chippewa participated in trading with other tribes, and later with the French, British and American traders here in turn. The Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians is the largest federally recognized tribe in Michigan, outnumbering the next largest tribe, the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians , by a scale of about 10 to one. It was recognized in 1972 with five units in seven counties. In 1979 the tribal council included the Mackinac Band as members, nearly doubling its enrollment. The tribe's revenues from its Kewadin Casinos has enabled it to establish health centers and invest in education for its members. Government The Sault Tribe operates its own government, with regular elections for chairperson and council members. Council members represent the tribe's five units throughout seven counties in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Over one half of the tribe's enrolled members reside outside the five units, but vote within those established units. They vote in a unit where they have significant ancestral or historic ties. In 2012 the current chairman Aaron A. Payment was elected by the largest majority in the tribe's modern history. He had first been elected to the Tribal Council in 1996. He was elected as chairman in 2004, defeating a 17-year incumbent. In 2008 he lost his race for re-election to Joe Eitrem, but was re-elected in 2012, 2016 and 2020. The tribe operates its own police department and tribal court.
