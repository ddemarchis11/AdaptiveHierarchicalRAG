During the 1980s he was appointed by Margaret Thatcher , then Prime Minister, to renovate the interiors of 10 Downing Street , restored 40 years previously by Raymond Erith, Terry's teacher, after war damage. Terry's work there is more assertive than Erith's. In Gloucestershire , he designed Waverton House, where he used the style made popular by Matthew Brettingham in the late 18th century, featuring a central staircase lit from above, surrounded by rooms on both floors. In 1989, he designed a series of three new villas for the Crown Estate Commissioners in Outer Circle in London's Regent's Park . Building in the park was controversial but said to be in the spirit of the Prince Regent 's original though unrealised intentions for the park, which was to contain numerous villas for Regency courtiers surrounding a new royal palace. Terry's three new villas have near-identical plans, based on Palladio 's Villa Saraceno , but the external elevations vary, showing respectively Gothic , Italian Mannerist and muscular Neo-classical features in the manner of William Chambers . Six villas were eventually built between 1989 and 2002. In the mid-1990s, Terry designed the restoration of St Helen's Bishopsgate , controversially turning the orientation of the medieval church through 90 degrees, moving or removing some fittings, and reworking its previous Tractarian Anglican layout into a Georgian stripped-back meeting house plan informed by the precepts of Reformation theology, in tune with its current firmly evangelical congregation. Also in the 1990s, he designed a castle for David and Frederick Barclay on their private island of Brecqhou in the Channel Islands. Terry designed the external envelope of New Margaret Thatcher Infirmary at the Royal Hospital Chelsea , with Steffian Bradley Architects as the lead consultant and planners for the building; a new Georgian Theatre for Downing College Cambridge; new offices, retail and residential development at 264–267 Tottenham Court Road , London; offices and retail at 22 Baker Street , London; and Queen Mother Square, Poundbury ; and mixed use development Richmond Riverside . In the United States His works in the US include the Abercrombie Residence, a classical mansion based on Marble Hill House , Twickenham , London. Complete with a piano nobile approached by an external staircase, it has a pediment supported by Corinthian columns. The house is constructed of Kasota limestone , with Indiana limestone dressings. Appraisal Terry's architecture was championed by David Watkin , who wrote the monograph Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry (2006), and by Roger Scruton who called it \"one long breath of fresh air\" in his Spectator article \"Hail Quinlan Terry: our greatest living architect\".",

      "text": "by David Watkin , who wrote the monograph Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry (2006), and by Roger Scruton who called it \"one long breath of fresh air\" in his Spectator article \"Hail Quinlan Terry: our greatest living architect\". Quinlan Terry is the single most distinguished and prolific architect at work in the Classical tradition in either Britain or the United States. He has attempted more completely than any other architect in Britain to pull the rug from beneath the false certainties of Modernism. – David Watkin (2006). Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry Conversely, Terry has been the subject of considerable criticism. A 2015 article in the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Journal quoted the late architectural historian Gavin Stamp , author of the Piloti column in the magazine Private Eye , in which Stamp derided Terry's work as \"stiff, pedantic and uninspiring, classical details stuck on to dull boxes\". The cultural critic Jonathan Meades , in a 2020 article in The Critic , repeated Stamp's strictures and dismissed Scruton's praise, \"[a man] who had no eye\", as \"embarrassingly silly\"; while Stephen Bayley is among those who have attacked the close relationship between Terry and the Prince of Wales. In a column in The Guardian in 2009, Bayley mocked the Prince's circle of architectural advisers as \"a coterie of fogeyish misfits, dreamers, forelock-tugging courtiers, DIY specialists, greasy pole-climbers [and] short-sighted antiquarians\", reserving particular scorn for Terry, \"a specialist in architectural pastiche [whose] modesty and art are in inverse proportion\". Honours In 2003 Terry won the Best Modern Classical House 2003, awarded by the British Georgian Group for Ferne House in Wiltshire . In 2005 Terry won the 3rd Annual Driehaus Prize , the most prestigious award for outstanding classical and traditional architects. He holds the Philippe Rothier European Prize for the Reconstruction of the City of Archives d'Architecture Moderne (1982). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to classical architecture.

Nicknamed the \" King of Cool \", he is regarded as one of the most popular entertainers of the 20th century. Martin gained his career breakthrough together with comedian Jerry Lewis , billed as Martin and Lewis , in 1946. They performed in nightclubs and later had numerous appearances on radio and television and in films. Following an acrimonious ending of the partnership in 1956, Martin pursued a solo career as a performer and actor. He established himself as a singer, recording numerous contemporary songs as well as standards from the Great American Songbook . Martin became one of the most popular acts in Las Vegas and was known for his friendship with fellow artists Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. , who together with several others formed the Rat Pack . Starting in 1965, Martin was the host of the television variety program The Dean Martin Show , which centered on Martin's singing and comedic talents and was characterized by his relaxed, easy-going demeanor. From 1974 to 1984, Martin was roastmaster on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast , a popular show that drew celebrities, comedians and politicians. Throughout his career, Martin performed on concert stages, in nightclubs and audio recordings and appeared in 85 film and television productions and sold 12 million records in the United States alone, over 50 million worldwide. Martin's best-known songs include \" Ain't That a Kick in the Head? \", \" Memories Are Made of This \", \" That's Amore \", \" Everybody Loves Somebody \", \" You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You \", \" Sway \", and \" Volare \".

Gaetano, who was a barber, was originally from Montesilvano, Pescara , Abruzzo and Angela was born December 18, 1897, in Fernwood, Ohio . Angela's father, Domenico Barra, emigrated from Monasterolo, Bergamo . Martin had an older brother Guglielmo \"William\" Antonio Crocetti (1916–1968). At 15, Martin billed himself as \"Kid Crochet\". His prizefighting earned him a broken nose (later straightened), a scarred lip, many broken knuckles (a result of not being able to afford tape used to wrap boxers' hands), and a bruised body.

      "text": "The complexity of the storyline is greatly reduced by eliminating subplots. Gluck was influenced by the example of French tragédies en musique , particularly those of Rameau . Like them, the opera contains a large number of expressive dances, extensive use of the chorus and accompanied recitative. The coup de théâtre of opening the drama with a chorus mourning one of the main characters is very similar to that used in Rameau's Castor et Pollux (1737). Other elements do not follow Gluck's subsequent reforms; for instance, the brisk, cheerful overture does not reflect the action to come. The role of Orfeo calls for an especially gifted actor, so that the strophic \"Chiamo il mio ben così\" does not become dull, and so that tragic import can be given both to this aria and to \"Che farò senza Euridice?\", both of which are based on harmonies that are not obviously mournful in nature. The first Orfeo, Gaetano Guadagni, was reputedly a fine actor who had certainly taken lessons while in London from the Shakespearian actor David Garrick . Guadagni was apparently also able to project a moving and emotive tone without raising his voice. Indeed, Gluck faced criticism of \"Che farò senza Euridice?\" on the grounds that it was emotionally uninvolved; he responded by pointing out the absolute necessity of fine execution of the aria: \"make the slightest change, either in the movement or in the turn of expression, and it will become a saltarello for marionettes\". Gluck's reforms, which began with Orfeo ed Euridice , have had significant influence throughout operatic history. Gluck's ideals heavily influenced the popular works of Mozart , Wagner , and Weber , with Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk vision especially influenced by that of Gluck. Old-style opera seria and the domination of embellishment -orientated singers came to be increasingly unpopular after the success of Gluck's operas as a whole and Orfeo in particular. In Orfeo ed Euridice the orchestra is far more predominant than in earlier opera, most notably in Orfeo's arioso \"Che puro ciel\". Here the voice is reduced to the comparatively minor role of recitative-style declamation, while the oboe carries the main melody, supported by solos from the flute, cello, bassoon, and horn. There is also accompaniment from the strings (playing in triplets) and the continuo in the most complex orchestration that Gluck ever wrote. Orchestration Gluck made a number of changes to the orchestration of Orfeo when adapting it from the original Italian version to the French version of 1774. Cornetts and chalumeaux are replaced by more common and modern oboes and clarinets , while the part played by",

It is also a tribute to those employees who served in the wars. The monument was designed and executed by the British sculptor Sydney March , of the March family of artists. Location Livesey Memorial Hall in 2011 The Livesey Hall War Memorial is located in the Sydenham area of Lewisham , Greater London, England. The locality is also referred to as Catford . It is positioned on Perry Hill, in the Bell Green neighbourhood, in front of Livesey Memorial Hall. Both structures take their name from the philanthropist Sir George Livesey (1834–1908), former chairman of the South Metropolitan Gas Company, as did the Livesey Museum for Children . Design The monument includes a bronze winged female figure with outstretched arms held aloft and wings spread horizontally. The triumphant Victory statue stands on a bronze globe encircled with serpents and set on a bronze wreathed base. This is all set on a semi-circular stone base to which a small bronze plaque was attached. Three steps lead to a backdrop of vertical limestone slabs on which three bronze plaques were affixed, two on the front and one on the back. The inscriptions on the left hand panel on the front and the smaller panel in the centre dedicated the memorial to the partners and employees of the South Suburban Gas Company who died in the two world wars. The inscriptions on the right hand panel on the front listed the names of the fallen. The panel also included a quote from English poet Rupert Brooke : \"If I should die, think only this of me: that there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England. There shall be in that rich earth a richer dust concealed.\" The bronze plaque on the back of the monument lists the partners and employees of the company who served during World War I. Dedication The Livesey Hall War Memorial, sometimes referred to as the Sydenham or Livesey War Memorial, was unveiled by Lord Robert Cecil (1864–1958) on 4 June 1920. The British statesman helped draft the League of Nations Covenant in 1919 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1937. National Heritage List for England The monument is a listed building . It was added as a Grade II structure on the National Heritage List for England on 25 April 1995. Its listing was amended on 30 August 1996. George Livesey's statue by F. W.

Loveleen has featured in the \"Annual Women's Big Impact Report\", an initiative of Hollywood's Variety magazine, which profiles women that have made pathbreaking contributions in world entertainment. Early life and background Loveleen Tandan was born and raised in New Delhi, India. She did her schooling from Mater Dei School. Loveleen studied Sociology Honors at the Hindu College, University of Delhi . She was active in college politics and was nominated as the Finance Minister of the college. She pursued a Master's degree with top honors in Mass Communication from MCRC , Jamia Millia Islamia University. Career Loveleen Tandan has worked with Deepa Mehta on Earth (1998), and later worked with Mira Nair on three films: Monsoon Wedding (2001), Vanity Fair (2004) and The Namesake (2006). She was also the casting director (alongside Shaheen Baig) for Brick Lane (2007), directed by Sarah Gavron and adapted from Monica Ali 's novel of the same name. Tandan's most major credit is Slumdog Millionaire (2008), where she initially began as one of the film's casting directors (with Gail Stevens co-ordinating casting from London) but was, during production on the film, designated as the \"Co-Director: India\" by Danny Boyle in recognition of her significant contributions in the making of the film. Boyle explained his reasoning behind the credit by stating it was \"because I had her there every day, and I kind of relied on her enormously to make sure I didn't make any big mistakes, and obviously, translation for the kids. And translation of the text because obviously, if you translate a line of Simon's literally into Hindi, a seven-year-old is just going to go… So, they had to be given a line that was the equivalent in Hindi.\" Tandan herself has stated that she was given the co-director credit after she \"suggested to Danny and Simon Beaufoy, the writer of Slumdog, that it was important to do some of it in Hindi to bring the film alive (20% of the film is in Hindi). They asked me to come up with Hindi dialogues which I, of course, instantly agreed to do. And as we drew closer to the shoot date, Danny asked me to step in as the co-director.\" The film won eight Academy Awards, five Critics' Choice Awards , four Golden Globes and seven BAFTA Awards .

      "text": "Arthur Bryce Courtenay , AM (14 August 1933 – 22 November 2012) was a South African-Australian advertising director and novelist. He is one of Australia's best-selling authors, notable for his book The Power of One . Background and early years Arthur Bryce Courtenay was born in the Lebombo Mountains in what was then the Union of South Africa , the son of Maude Greer and Arthur Ryder. Ryder was married with six children, and lived with his family, but also maintained a relationship with Greer, with whom he already had a daughter, Rosemary. Maude Greer gave the surname Courtenay to both her children. Bryce Courtenay spent most of his early years in a small village in the Lebombo Mountains in the Northern Transvaal province (present-day Limpopo ). He later attended King Edward VII School, Johannesburg . In 1955, while studying journalism in London, Courtenay met Benita Solomon. They emigrated to Sydney in 1958, married in 1959 and had three sons – Brett, Adam and Damon. Courtenay entered the advertising industry and, over a career spanning 34 years, was the Creative Director of McCann Erickson , J. Walter Thompson and George Patterson Advertising . His award-winning campaigns included the original Milkybar Kid commercial. Along with Geoff Pike , Courtenay developed the concept behind the Cadbury Yowie , a chocolate that contained a children's toy, typically an Australian or New Zealand native animal. On 1 April 1991, Courtenay's son Damon (who was born with the blood condition haemophilia ) died at age 24 from AIDS-related complications , contracted through a blood transfusion. Courtenay divorced Benita in 2000 and acknowledged sexual relationships with other women during their 42-year marriage. Benita Courtenay died on 11 March 2007, at the age of 72, four months after being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia . He later lived in Canberra with his second wife, Christine Gee. Writing Courtenay's novels are primarily set in South Africa, the country of his birth, or Australia, his adopted country. His first book, The Power of One , was published in 1989 and, despite Courtenay's fears that it would never sell, quickly became one of Australia's best-selling books by any living author. The story was made into a film , as well as being re-released in an edition for children. Courtenay was one of Australia's most commercially successful authors. He built up this success over the long term by promoting himself and developing a relationship with readers as much as marketing his books; for instance, he gave away up to 2,500 books free each year to readers he met in the street. However, only The Power of One has been published in the United States. Courtenay claimed that this was because",
