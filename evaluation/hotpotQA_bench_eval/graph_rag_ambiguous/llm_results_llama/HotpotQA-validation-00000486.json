      "text": "\" Hoppípolla \" ( pronounced [ˈhɔʰpiˌpʰɔtl̥a] ) is a song by Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós from their 2005 album Takk... . It was released as the album's second single on 28 November 2005. The song title is a univerbation of hoppa í polla (the -a in hoppa is not pronounced ), which is Icelandic for \"hopping into puddles\", and the lyrics are mainly in Icelandic, with some nonsensical phrases, a \"language\" the band calls Vonlenska (\"Hopelandic\"). As with many of the band's songs, it was given a nickname in the early stages of writing. \"Hoppípolla\" was \"The Money Song\", as the band was certain they had written a song which would have commercial success. \"Hoppípolla\" is the band's most successful single, charting at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart in May 2006. It is also considered the best-known song within its genre.  The single also features \"Með blóðnasir\", an instrumental coda to \"Hoppípolla\", which is also featured on Takk... ; and a studio remake of \"Hafssól\", a song previously released on the band's 1997 debut album, Von . The title appears as \"Hafsól\" on the single.

It depicts two groups of elderly friends strolling around the suburbs of Reykjavík and acting like children; pulling pranks on people and battling with water balloons and wooden swords near a cemetery . When one old man is injured and suffers a nosebleed (as referenced in the lyrics), the opponents run away in fear, while the others celebrate their victory. The video shows several shots of the friends \"hopping in puddles\" of water along a path. The band members are featured in the video: keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson plays the victim of a Knock, Knock, Ginger trick, guitarist and vocalist Jón Þór Birgisson plays the cashier at a shop where an old man steals and eats some pears, drummer Orri Páll Dýrason can be seen repairing his bicycle,",

He has won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical three times, making him the first actor to have three wins in that category. He is perhaps best known for his role as Inspector Javert in the stage musical Les Misérables and in the Les Misérables: The Dream Cast in Concert . He is also well-known for numerous other theatre roles, notable ones being Georges Seurat /George in Sunday in the Park with George (which won him a Laurence Olivier Award ), Archibald Craven and Dr. Neville Craven in The Secret Garden , Judge Turpin in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street , George Banks in Mary Poppins , Georges in La Cage aux Folles , Juan Peron in Evita , Fred Anderson in A Christmas Carol , and The Wolf and Cinderella's Prince in Into the Woods . He is also known for appearances in film and for his roles in television shows such as Ultraviolet , Brides of Christ , and Play School . Early life and education Quast, one of three children, was born in 1957 in Tamworth, New South Wales . His family lived and worked on a mixed, but predominantly turkey, farm. He graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1979. Acting career 1980s Theatre After graduating from NIDA in 1979 Quast began his career in the resident acting company of the State Theatre Company of South Australia . In the early 1980s he appeared in plays such as The Mystery Plays of Wakefield , Three Sisters , On the Wallaby , Pericles , A Month in the Country , As You Like It , Pygmalion , A Hard God , No End of Blame , The Threepenny Opera , Shark Infested Waters , Candide with Nimrod Theatre Company , and a musical adaption of Carmen which he debuted with the Melbourne Theatre Company . Les Misérables Quast shot to prominence in 1987 as Javert in the original Australian production of Les Misérables , winning him a Sydney Critic Award and a Mo Award . In 1989, he traveled to London to reprise the role on the West End stage. Quast never expected to gain such a prominent role, going to the auditions hoping simply for a place in the chorus. Unable to sight-read music, he walked off the stage at the audition but was called back by Claude-Michel Schönberg and eventually given the part as Javert . Quast credits much of his success as Javert to stage director Trevor Nunn . \"Javert for me is not the Wicked Witch of the West ,\" Quast has said. \"In fact, there is very little material to work with in the script. Trevor would say things in passing like 'Have you read the Ten",

The single was also a top 20 hit in Canada and reached No. 2 in Australia (September 1985), but only reached No. 51 on the UK charts. The British press dismissed the album, with New Musical Express calling the band 'INX-cusable' and a reviewer declaring Listen Like Thieves to be a 'complete and utter turkey'. In the United States, however, Rolling Stone wrote, \"INXS rocks with passion and seals the deal with a backbeat that'll blackmail your feet.\" In August 1985, INXS toured ahead of the release of Listen Like Thieves , touring South America before returning to Melbourne to play for Prince Charles and Princess Diana of Wales at a concert. The concert was filmed and later released on a home video entitled Living INXS ; an edited version of the concert was played on MTV in the U.S. in 1985 on its Saturday night concert series. INXS toured North America, Europe, and New Zealand from November 1985 to February 1986. Next the band took a two-month break, with Andrew Farriss writing and producing \"You're Gonna Get Hurt\" for Jenny Morris (who had previously been a backing vocalist with the band), and Hutchence featuring in Richard Lowenstein 's second feature film Dogs in Space . Lowenstein had previously made the video clip for \" Dancing on the Jetty \". While a song from the movie, \"Rooms for the Memory\", written by Ollie Olsen , with vocals by Hutchence charted, the movie was received well by critics but was not a commercial success. Beginning in May 1986, the band performed 32 European shows (including support for Queen at their Live at Wembley '86 concert on 12 July), 42 U.S. shows, and 12 Australian shows. America's influential Musician magazine called INXS \"the best live band in the world.\" From \"Good Times\" to Kick Lead singer Michael Hutchence in 1986 While the band took an eight-month break before beginning work on a new album, manager CM Murphy decided to stage a series of major outdoor concerts across Australia featuring INXS, Jimmy Barnes , Models , Divinyls , Mental as Anything , The Triffids and I'm Talking . To promote the tour, INXS recorded two songs with Jimmy Barnes of Cold Chisel: The Easybeats cover \" Good Times \" and \"Laying Down the Law\" which Barnes co-wrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly. \"Good Times\" was used as the theme song for the Australian Made series of concerts in the summer of 1986–1987. It peaked at No. 2 on the Australian charts, and months later was featured in the Joel Schumacher film The Lost Boys and its soundtrack ,",

In September 2019, Carter was granted a temporary restraining order against his younger brother Aaron after alleging that Aaron threatened to kill his then-pregnant wife. On November 20, the judge made the decision the day after one of Carter's sisters was granted a domestic violence restraining order against Aaron, and Carter's brother-in-law was granted a harassment restraining order until November 2020, also against Aaron. On February 18, 2022, in a class-action lawsuit filed against the cryptocurrency company SafeMoon that alleged the company is a pump and dump scheme, Carter was named a defendant along with YouTuber and professional boxer Jake Paul , rappers Soulja Boy and Lil Yachty , and social media personality Ben Phillips for promoting the SafeMoon token on their social media accounts with misleading information . On the same day, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media. Sexual assault allegations 2006 incident In October 2017, Radar Online reported on a March 2006 incident involving a 20-year-old fan at a house party. Information was obtained from an incident report filed by police in West Allis, Wisconsin . The alleged victim, whose name was not disclosed, stated that after drinking with Carter and his friend Rob Kalouch, she was digitally penetrated by Carter and was forced to perform oral sex on both men. She stated that she refused them, telling them that she had a boyfriend and was \"saving herself for marriage\". The alleged victim stated that the two attempted to have intercourse with her later, as she pretended to be asleep. The report indicated that afterward, she was brought to the hospital and interviewed by police. The victim did not press charges, and the case was closed in June 2006. Melissa Schuman accusation In November 2017, following the Radar Online report, Melissa Schuman , a former member of the girl group Dream , publicly claimed that Carter had raped her. The alleged rape occurred in 2003, according to paperwork filed by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Schuman said Carter provided her with alcohol and slipped a roofie into the alcohol before raping her. Schuman stated that she was emboldened to disclose the incident after observing similarities to the 2006 accusation. Carter denied Schuman's allegation. In February 2018, it was reported that the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office would not pursue charges against Carter in the case because the statute of limitations had expired. Schuman later sued Carter over the allegation in April 2023. In August 2024, it was revealed that Carter had countersued Schuman for $2.5 million, accusing her of defamation .

Jerrod Niemann 's late-2017 album This Ride features Diamond Rio on the song \"I Ain't All There\". Some of the individual members have also contributed to songs by other artists. Roe sang duet vocals with then-labelmate Pam Tillis on \"Love Is Only Human\", a cut from her 1992 album Homeward Looking Angel . Olander was featured along with bluegrass musicians Carl Jackson and Mark O'Connor on the track \"Hap Towne Breakdowne\" from Steve Wariner's 1996 instrumental album No More Mr. Nice Guy .

Truman co-wrote Shane Minor 's 1999 single \" Ordinary Love \"; Minor would later co-write the band's hit \"Beautiful Mess\". In 2003, Truman and songwriter Jason Deere co-founded the Nashville Tribute Band , which has recorded three albums for missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , of which Truman is a member. Roe, Johnson, and Williams sang backing vocals on Josh Turner 's 2006 single \" Me and God \" (from the album Your Man ), which also featured a guest vocal from bluegrass musician Ralph Stanley . Musical stylings In the country music industry particularly, record producers hire mostly session musicians to record instrumental tracks for an album for both solo artists and bands, as opposed to rock bands who record their own instrumental and vocal tracks on their albums. Diamond Rio has been one of few self-contained country bands to have followed the practice of each member playing their own instruments and singing their own vocals on all their albums themselves, without any additional input from outside musicians. The sole exception has been the inclusion of string sections on some of their later work, starting with \"I Know How the River Feels\" and continuing through certain tracks on One More Day and Completely . According to Prout, other labels had rejected the band prior to their signing with Arista Nashville due to the band members' insistence that they play all their own instruments. Their early music blended neotraditionalist country with occasional traces of country rock , primarily in the song's prominent rhythm sections . A bluegrass influence has also been shown, primarily in the three-part harmonies among Roe (lead), Williams (baritone), and Johnson (tenor). Bluegrass influences are also shown in the band's prominent use of the mandolin , as well as in the instrumentals featured on many of their earlier albums. The band's later material has tended towards pop-oriented ballads, such as \"I Believe\" and \"One More Day\" – songs which received critical acclaim for their often",
