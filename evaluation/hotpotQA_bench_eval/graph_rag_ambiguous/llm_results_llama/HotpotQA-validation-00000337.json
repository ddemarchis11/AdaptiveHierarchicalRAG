      "text": "\" Can't Take My Eyes Off You \" is a 1967 song written by Bob Crewe and Bob Gaudio , and first recorded and released as a single by Gaudio's Four Seasons bandmate Frankie Valli . The song was among his biggest hits, earning a gold record and reaching No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a week, making it Valli's biggest solo hit until he hit No. 1 in 1975 with \" My Eyes Adored You \". \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" has been recorded in many other arrangements, many of which have charted in different countries. Background Gaudio describes the song as \"the one that almost got away\" until Windsor, Ontario , radio station CKLW (a station also serving the Detroit metro on the American side of the border) intervened. In 1967, the record's producers urged Paul Drew, program director at the station, to consider the tune for rotation . For much of the 1960s and 1970s, CKLW was credited with launching hit records via its powerful signal, blanketing the Great Lakes region; in addition to CKLW, Drew also held a role as the national program director for the entire RKO General 's contemporary hit radio chain, putting him in a particularly strong position to break new records to a national audience. Drew did not warm to the song at first, but accepted an invitation to hear it live at the Roostertail, where Valli was performing a weeklong stint with the Four Seasons. Drew liked what he heard and added the song to his station's playlist. \"The switchboards lit up, and the rest, as they say, is history\", Gaudio recalled. Valli recalled in 2014 that \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" was the first step in the fulfillment of his goal to sing music that did not require him to use falsetto : \"I didn't want to sing like that my whole life. Once we established the sound, the plan was that eventually I would do solo [records] and some things I really wanted to do. I was very lucky to make the transition to 'My Eyes Adored You' and ' Swearin' to God ', which had none of that.\" Valli also recalled that the record had been mothballed by The Four Seasons' record company for a year because of their fear that The Four Seasons (who had already lost Nick Massi in 1965) were breaking up, to which Valli insisted that he had no intentions of ever leaving The Four Seasons. Credits The song was written by Bob Crewe and Bob Gaudio .

In early 2010, they went on tour with New Found Glory , Saves the Day , and Fireworks. According to their Twitter on February 25, 2010, they officially parted ways with Drive-Thru Records. This ended an over year-long lawsuit with the label which hindered a new album release which had already been written and recorded. Future releases will now be through their own label, Wasted Summer.

In July and August, the group went on a tour of the US with Relient K , William Beckett and House of Heroes .

As Mars later said, \"We were confused about what we were.\" Sometime in late 1981, the Replacements played a song called \"Kids Don't Follow\".  Jesperson was convinced the song sounded like a hit and pleaded with the Twin/Tone co-owners Stark and Hallman, \"I will do anything to get this out. I will hand-stamp jackets if I have to.\" The partners agreed to fund the recording, but Jesperson and virtually everyone he knew had to hand-stamp ten thousand white record jackets. The band recorded eight tracks within a week, with Jesperson as producer. Their \"balls-to-the-wall hardcore punk attempt\", their first EP Stink , containing \"Kids Don't Follow\" and seven other songs, was released in June 1982, six months after a show in Chicago . The Replacements began to distance themselves from the hardcore punk scene after the release of Stink . \"We write songs rather than riffs with statements,\" Westerberg later stated. Inspired by other rock subgenres, he had been writing songs that incorporated a wide range of musical styles. He even wrote an acoustic ballad, \"You're Getting Married One Night\", but when he played it to the rest of the band, it was met with silence. \"Save that for your solo album, Paul,\" Bob Stinson said. \"That ain't the Replacements\". The track remained unreleased for years. Westerberg realized his toughest audience was the band itself, later saying, \"If it doesn't rock enough, Bob will scoff at it, and if it isn't catchy enough, Chris won't like it, and if it isn't modern enough, Tommy won't like it.\" Hootenanny and Let It Be (1983–1984) The Replacements publicity photo, c. 1983 .

Westerberg wrote songs in stops and starts, so it took several sessions of recording to finish the album. Stark's meticulous approach to recording contrasted with that of the Replacements, often frustrating the band. In one session, Mars and Westerberg switched instruments and the band began to improvise, with Westerberg repeatedly shouting, \"It's a hootenanny.\" The band declared it to be \"side one, track one\" of the new album. According to Stark, the recording \"was a complete joke from their point of view—they did not care what they delivered\". Hootenanny , the band's second studio album, was released in April 1983. On Hootenanny Westerberg expanded his songwriting capabilities, in songs such as \"Willpower\", with echoed vocals and",

      "text": "Violent Femmes are an American folk punk band from Milwaukee , Wisconsin , United States. The band consists of founding members Gordon Gano (guitar, lead vocals) and Brian Ritchie (bass, backing vocals), joined by multi-instrumentalist Blaise Garza (joined 2004), and drummer John Sparrow (joined 2005). Former members of the band include drummers Victor DeLorenzo (1980–1993, 2002–2013), Guy Hoffman (1993–2002), and Brian Viglione (2013–2016). Violent Femmes are considered to be an integral part of the then-underground folk punk and alternative rock scenes of the 1980s, and remain influential or inspirational to the subsequent movements, particularly on folk rock , indie rock , grunge , pop punk , emo , and the late 1980s and 1990s alternative rock scene. Violent Femmes have released 10 studio albums and 19 singles during the course of their career. The band found critical acclaim with the release of their self-titled debut album in early 1983. Featuring many of their best-known songs, including \" Blister in the Sun \", \"Kiss Off\", \" Add It Up \", and \" Gone Daddy Gone \", Violent Femmes became the band's biggest-selling album and was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA . After releasing two more albums, Hallowed Ground (1984) and The Blind Leading the Naked (1986), the band's future was uncertain and they split up in 1987 when Gano and Ritchie went solo. They regrouped a year later, however, releasing their fourth album 3 (1989). The follow-up album, Why Do Birds Sing? (1991), contains the fan favorite and concert staple \"American Music\".  In 1993, founding member Victor DeLorenzo (percussion, snare drum) left Violent Femmes and was replaced by Guy Hoffman, who debuted on the band's sixth album New Times (1994). Two more albums – Rock!!!!! (1995) and Freak Magnet (2000) – were released with this lineup before DeLorenzo rejoined the band in 2002 for what was to be a farewell tour. Following the commercial failure of Freak Magnet , Violent Femmes did not release any more studio albums for almost two decades, although a number of compilation albums were released in the early 2000s, along with a few one-off songs. Some controversy over the licensing of the band's songs for commercial use led to an official break-up in 2009, though they re-formed in 2013 (shortly before DeLorenzo left Violent Femmes again), and have since released two more studio albums of new material: We Can Do Anything (2016) and Hotel Last Resort (2019).

      "summary": "**Title:** Count Basie’s Legacy and Collaborations  \n\n**Summary:**  \nCount Basie, a pioneering jazz pianist and bandleader, sustained the Big Band era by collaborating with iconic vocalists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Joe Williams, and Tony Bennett, producing landmark albums from the 1950s through the 1970s. His orchestra, noted for the “New Testament” band sound, featured arrangements by Quincy Jones, Neal Hefti, and Sammy Nestico, yielding Grammy-winning and Hall-of-Fame recordings. Basie’s later life was marked by personal losses—his wife Catherine in 1983 and his own death to pancreatic cancer in 1984—yet his influence endures through honors including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a U.S. postage stamp, and multiple inductions into music Halls of Fame.  \n\n**Keywords:**  \nCount Basie, Big Band jazz, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Grammy Hall of Fame",
