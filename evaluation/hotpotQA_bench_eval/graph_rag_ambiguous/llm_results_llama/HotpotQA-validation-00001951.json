Development of this version was initiated due to multiple systems being compromised to the West by Phazotron engineer Adolf Tolkachev . This was the final version of the MiG-29 produced before the collapse of the Soviet Union and only limited numbers were produced. Upgraded variants based on original airframe MiG-29S (Product 9.12S) Post Soviet upgrade for older 9.12 variants incorporating the changes developed for version 9.13S. MiG-29SD (Product 9.12SD) Export variant of upgraded 9.12S with downgraded versions of radar and avionics. MiG-29SE (Product 9.13SE) Export variant of the 9.13S with slightly downgraded N-019ME radar with multiple target tracking ability and RVV-AE (R-77 missile) compatibility. The first export model MiG-29 with underwing drop tanks; the inner underwing pylons can carry over 500 kg (1,100 lb) bombs in side by side tandem pairs. Its weapons mix includes R-27T1, R-27ER1 and R-27ET1 medium-range missiles. The aircraft can be fitted with active ECM systems, weapons guidance aids, improved built-in check and training systems.

Baza Lotnicza ) ( ICAO : EPLK ) is a Polish Air Force base, located in Łask , about 30 km south-west of Łódź . It is one of the two bases where Poland 's F-16 fighters are stationed, the other being 31st Air Base . 9 of them were first moved there in October 2008. The goal is to have 16 fighters, operated by the 10th Tactical Squadron . A detachment of the US Air Force has been permanently based at Łask since November, 2012. Additional units rotate to the base periodically to conduct training exercises. The force is thought to be nuclear-capable and has joined nuclear exercises with NATO . The base airfield was built in 1957. The current base unit, combining infrastructure and ground personnel, was formed in 2001. In the past there were plans to use this airfield for civilian airliners, but with the expansion of nearby Łódź Władysław Reymont Airport these have been shelved.

Jet era English Electric Canberra of the RAAF, 1964 No. 1 Squadron re-equipped with Canberra Mk.20s after returning to Australia. The RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra was subsonic but had long range and was highly manoeuvrable. It had been procured partly for its capacity to deliver nuclear weapons , an ordnance option the government seriously contemplated but never acquired. Initially the Canberra's envisaged mission profile was medium-to-high-altitude area bombing but its primitive bombsight and light load made this a dubious proposition, and by mid-1961 crews were training in low-level army cooperation tactics. No. 1 Squadron was awarded successive Gloucester Cups for its proficiency in 1959–60 and 1960–61. As of January 1962, its strength was eight aircraft and 53 personnel, including 18 officers. The unit effectively ceased operations in 1968, to begin converting to the General Dynamics F-111C supersonic bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Already controversial owing to its escalating cost, the F-111 program was heavily delayed by airworthiness concerns related to its swing-wing technology. In September 1970, as an interim measure while awaiting delivery of the F-111, No. 1 Squadron relinquished its Canberras for leased McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms . Although the Phantom had a multi-role capability, the RAAF employed it as a strike aircraft to maintain compatibility with the proposed F-111 mission profile. One of No. 1 Squadron's Phantoms was lost with its crew of two in June 1971, the only fatalities and hull loss of the 24 aircraft leased to the RAAF. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and well regarded by its Australian crews. F-4E Phantom of the RAAF, 1971 No. 82 Wing accepted its first F-111Cs in June 1973. The Chief of the Air Staff , Air Marshal Charles Read , ordered that the new aircraft be flown with great caution initially, well within operational limits, to minimise the possibility of further damage to its reputation through early attrition. No. 1 Squadron was assigned 12 of the initial 24 aircraft delivered. It was No. 82 Wing's lead strike force, No. 6 Squadron's primary task being crew conversion training . The wing employed a centralised servicing regime, whereby all aircraft and maintenance personnel were held by No. 482 Squadron, which released the F-111s in line with Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons' joint flying program. In February 1981, responsibility for operating-level servicing of the F-111s",

Both wings were under the TAC's 831st Air Division . Assigned squadrons of the 37th (Tail Code: \"WW\") at George AFB were: 561st Tactical Fighter Squadron : 30 March 1981 – 5 October 1989 (Yellow Tail Stripe) 562nd Tactical Fighter Training Squadron : 30 March 1981 – 5 October 1989 (Blue Tail Stripe) As the only \"Wild Weasel\" training wing in the world, it provided instructor pilots and qualified aircrews for the other two \"Wild Weasel\" wings in the Philippines (3d TFW) and West Germany (52d TFW). As part of the training mission, the wing participated in numerous tactical, maritime, and electronic warfare exercises locally and worldwide in hunter/killer tactics, suppression of enemy air defenses, force escort operations and dissimilar air combat training with Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve squadrons, and various allies. Wing aircrews and ground personnel won the United States Air Force Worldwide Fighter gunnery meet in 1985 and 1987. In 1988, George AFB was scheduled in the first round of base closures passed by Congress under the Base Realignment and Closure program. On 5 October 1989, the 37th TFW turned over F-4G aircraft to the host 35th TFW at George AFB. Superfund site In June 2018, Military Times reported several cases of unusual medical conditions suffered by Air Force women and wives of service members, plus one case of a rare cancer that killed the Air Force husband of one of the affected women. The article claims that nearly 300 women have connected on Facebook, and shared tales of ovarian cysts , uterine tumors , birth defects in their children, hysterectomies , and miscarriages . Jet fuel, trichloroethylene , and PFOS / PFOA are said to contaminate the base's water supply. George AFB was designated a superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1990. Remedial action is still underway to clean up 33 separate hazardous wastes left there. Closure George Air Force Base was officially decommissioned in December 1992. In 1993, President Bill Clinton announced a \"Five Part Plan\" to speed economic recovery in communities where military bases were to be closed. One part of this plan called for improving public participation in the base's environmental cleanup program. George AFB was among a number of installations where environmental cleanup was placed on a \"fast track\" so base property could be quickly transferred to the community for reuse.

On 10 May 2008, a Darfur rebel group, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) mounted an assault on the Sudanese capital. During this action, the JEM shot down a Sudanese Air Force MiG-29 with 12.7 and 14.5 mm (0.500 and 0.571 in) heavy machine gun fire while it was attacking a convoy of vehicles in the Khartoum suburb of Omdurman . The aircraft was piloted by a Russian mercenary. He was killed in action as his parachute did not open after ejecting. On 14 November 2008 Sudanese Ministry of Defence admitted that Sudan had received 12 MiG-29s from Russia. An anonymous Russian source claimed that the aircraft had been delivered before 2004. During the brief 2012 South Sudan–Sudan border conflict , on 4 April 2012, Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) claimed the downing of a Sudanese MiG-29 using antiaircraft guns. The Sudan government denied the claim. On 16 April 2012, the SPLA issued a second claim about the downing of a Sudanese MiG-29. It was not clear if this second claim referred to the previous one. On 15 April 2023, a Sudanese MiG-29 was captured on film firing missiles over Khartoum during a skirmish with paramilitary forces. 25 May 2023, a Sudanese MiG-29 was filmed being shot down by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) over Omdurman .

Fourteen were MiG-29S models, which are equipped with an active radar jammer in its spine and are capable of being armed with nuclear weapons.
