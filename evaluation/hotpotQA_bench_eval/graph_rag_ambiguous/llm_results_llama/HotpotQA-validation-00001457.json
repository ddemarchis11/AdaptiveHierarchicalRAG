      "text": "Britten in 1968, by Hans Wild Edward Benjamin Britten, Baron Britten OM CH (22 November 1913 – 4 December 1976) was an English composer, conductor, and pianist. He was a central figure of 20th-century British music, with a range of works including opera, other vocal music, orchestral and chamber pieces. His best-known works include the opera Peter Grimes (1945), the War Requiem (1962) and the orchestral showpiece The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). Britten was born in Lowestoft , Suffolk , the son of a dentist. He showed talent from an early age. He studied at the Royal College of Music in London and privately with the composer Frank Bridge . Britten first came to public attention with the a cappella choral work A Boy Was Born in 1934. With the premiere of Peter Grimes in 1945, he leapt to international fame. Over the next 28 years, he wrote 14 more operas, establishing himself as one of the leading 20th-century composers in the genre. In addition to large-scale operas for Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden , he wrote chamber operas for small forces, suitable for performance in venues of modest size. Among the best known of these is The Turn of the Screw (1954). Recurring themes in his operas include the struggle of an outsider against a hostile society and the corruption of innocence. Britten's other works range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and instrumental as well as film music. He took a great interest in writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera Noye's Fludde , a Missa Brevis , and the song collection Friday Afternoons . He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the tenor Peter Pears ; others included Kathleen Ferrier , Jennifer Vyvyan , Janet Baker , Dennis Brain , Julian Bream , Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau , Osian Ellis and Mstislav Rostropovich . Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as Bach 's Brandenburg Concertos , Mozart symphonies, and song cycles by Schubert and Schumann . Together with Pears and the librettist and producer Eric Crozier , Britten founded the annual Aldeburgh Festival in 1948, and he was responsible for the creation of Snape Maltings concert hall in 1967. In 1976, he was the first composer to be given a life peerage . He died shortly afterwards, aged 63.

      "text": "Orfeo ed Euridice ( Italian: [orˈfɛːo ed euriˈdiːtʃe] ; French : Orphée et Eurydice ; English: Orpheus and Eurydice ) is an opera composed by Christoph Willibald Gluck , based on the myth of Orpheus and set to a libretto by Ranieri de' Calzabigi . It belongs to the genre of the azione teatrale , meaning an opera on a mythological subject with choruses and dancing. The piece was first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 5 October 1762, in the presence of Empress Maria Theresa . Orfeo ed Euridice is the first of Gluck's \"reform\" operas, in which he attempted to replace the abstruse plots and overly complex music of opera seria with a \"noble simplicity\" in both the music and the drama. The opera is the most popular of Gluck's works, and was one of the most influential on subsequent German operas . Variations on its plot—the underground rescue mission in which the hero must control, or conceal, his emotions—can be found in Mozart 's The Magic Flute , Beethoven 's Fidelio , and Wagner 's Das Rheingold . Though originally set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to the genre of French opera , particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence of vocal virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera to suit the tastes of a Parisian audience at the Académie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline . This reworking was given the title Orphée et Eurydice , and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes. Background Algarotti by Jean-Étienne Liotard in the Rijksmuseum Francesco Algarotti 's Essay on the Opera (1755) was a major influence in the development of Gluck's reformist ideology. Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of opera seria , with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music or ballet or staging. The drama itself should \"delight the eyes and ears, to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense\". Algarotti's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist, Calzabigi. Calzabigi was himself a prominent advocate of reform, and he stated, \"If Mr Gluck was the creator of dramatic music, he did not create it from nothing. I provided him with the material or the chaos, if you like. We therefore share the honour of that creation.\" Other influences included the composer",

In 1857, Italian versions were performed in Naples: at the Teatro Nuovo with the title Giovanni di Sicilia in the spring and at the Teatro San Carlo with the title Batilde di Turenna in the autumn. Overall, Verdi was not happy with the translation, which Budden regards as \"one of the worst ever perpetrated\". Some improvements were made after the unification of Italy in 1861, when the title of the Italian version of the opera was changed to I vespri siciliani . Verdi wrote to Ricordi on 6 June 1865: \"I now know what it means to translate and I feel sympathy for all bad translations that are around because it is impossible to make a good one\". The opera was also performed outside of Italy in Italian translation: Barcelona (4 October 1856), Lisbon (12 March 1857), Saint Petersburg (1857), Santiago, Chile (1857), London at the Drury Lane Theatre (27 July 1859), New York City (7 November 1859), Constantinople (October 1860), Buenos Aires (23 May 1862), Havana (1862), Malta (1862), Mexico (November 1864), Sydney (May 1870), and Rio de Janeiro (1872). Other languages It was performed in Hungarian in Budapest (1856); in German (in a translation by Karl Ferdinand Dräxler-Manfred [ de ] ) in Darmstadt (14 March 1857; revived 12 September 1887), Vienna (19 November 1857), and Prague (1859); and in Polish in Warsaw (1872). A Swedish translation by Fritz Arlberg was published in 1872. 20th century and beyond After a long period of relative neglect, the opera in its original French version has begun to appear onstage more regularly in the 21st century. A production was mounted at the Bastille Opera in 2003 and a 2010 production by the Netherlands Opera . In May 2011 French versions were presented at the Grand Théâtre de Genève and at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples and, in February 2013, the ABAO company in Bilbao presented the opera. Other presentations have included stagings by Frankfurt Opera in 2013 and Bavarian State Opera in 2018. The Royal Opera House Covent Garden's staging of the full version for the first time in its history (minus the ballet) in October/November 2013 drew a variety of critical responses.

      "text": "Les vêpres siciliennes ( French pronunciation: [le vɛːpʁ sisiljɛn] ; The Sicilian Vespers ) is a grand opera in five acts by the Italian romantic composer Giuseppe Verdi set to a French libretto by Eugène Scribe and Charles Duveyrier from their work Le duc d'Albe of 1838. Les vêpres followed immediately after Verdi's three great mid-career masterpieces, Rigoletto , Il trovatore and La traviata of 1850 to 1853 and was first performed at the Paris Opéra on 13 June 1855. Today the opera is performed both in the original French and (rather more frequently) in its post-1861 Italian version as I vespri siciliani . The story is based on a historical event, the Sicilian Vespers of 1282, using material drawn from the medieval Sicilian tract Lu rebellamentu di Sichilia . Composition history Verdi in 1859 After Verdi's first grand opera for the Paris Opéra – his adaptation of I Lombardi in 1847 given under the title of Jérusalem – the composer had wanted to write a completely new grand opera for the company, the appeal being the same as that which influenced all Italian composers of the day: the challenges of a form different from that of their homeland and the ability to appeal to an audience which welcomed novelty. Eugène Scribe, librettist of the opera Verdi began discussions with the Opéra but negotiations were stalled by the 1848 revolutions and the composer broke them off for a period of time. It was not until February 1852 (while Il trovatore was still being prepared) that he returned to Paris and entered into a contract to write an opera, the libretto to be prepared by Scribe, who was given a deadline for a \"treatment\" to be delivered on 30 June 1853 with rehearsals to begin in mid-1854 and the opera staged in November/December of that year. Verdi was guaranteed the choice of suitable artists as well as forty performances in the ten months following the premiere. In July 1852, Verdi had written to Scribe outlining his hopes: I should like, I need a subject that is grandiose, impassioned and original; a mise-en-scène that is imposing and overwhelming. I have consistently in view so many of those magnificent scene to be found in your poems ... Indeed, these scenes are miracles! But you work them so often that I hope you will work one for me. When Scribe missed his July 1853 deadline, Verdi went to Paris to negotiate directly and it was then that the librettist proposed a solution, using a revised version of the libretto for Le duc d'Albe , one which had been written about",

      "text": "Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev (27 April [ O.S. 15 April] 1891 – 5 March 1953) was a Russian composer, pianist, and conductor who later worked in the Soviet Union . As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres , he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century. His works include such widely heard pieces as the March from The Love for Three Oranges , the suite Lieutenant Kijé , the ballet Romeo and Juliet —from which \"Dance of the Knights\" is taken—and Peter and the Wolf . Of the established forms and genres in which he worked, he created—excluding juvenilia —seven completed operas, seven symphonies , eight ballets , five piano concertos , two violin concertos , a cello concerto , a symphony-concerto for cello and orchestra , and nine completed piano sonatas . A graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915, Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite , compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes . Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev— Chout , Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son —which, at the time of their original production, all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. But Prokofiev's greatest interest was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel . Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges , composed for the Chicago Opera and performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia. After the Revolution of 1917 , Prokofiev left Russia with the approval of Soviet People's Commissar Anatoly Lunacharsky , and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, pianist and conductor. In 1923 he married a Spanish singer, Carolina (Lina) Codina , with whom he had two sons; they divorced in 1947. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev's ballets and operas to be staged in America and Western Europe. Prokofiev, who regarded himself as a composer foremost, resented the time taken by touring as a pianist, and increasingly turned to the Soviet Union for commissions of new music; in 1936, he finally returned to his homeland with his family. His greatest Soviet successes included Lieutenant",

      "text": "documented in 1144, and the Slovenian form appeared in records as early as 1146. The 10th-century work Life of Gregentios provides the Greek variant Λυπλιανές ( Lyplianés ) and situates it among the Avars in the 6th century. This account is influenced by an earlier northern Italian source written shortly after the conquest of 774 . The connection between the Slovene and German names has posed a puzzle for scholars. In 2007, linguist Tijmen Pronk , an authority in comparative Indo-European linguistics and Slovene dialectology from the University of Leiden , provided strong support for the theory that the Slavic ljub- 'to love, like' was the most likely origin. He argued that the river's name likely stemmed from the settlement's name. Silvo Torkar, a linguist with expertise in Slovene names, put forth the idea that Ljubljana's name has its roots in Ljubija , the original name of the Ljubljanica River . This can be traced back to the Old Slavic male name Ljubovid , which translates to 'the one with a lovely appearance'. Torkar also asserted that the name Laibach is a combination of German and Slovene, sharing its origins with the same personal name. Dragon symbol The city's symbol is the Ljubljana Dragon . It is depicted on the top of the tower of Ljubljana Castle in the Ljubljana coat of arms and on the Ljubljanica-crossing Dragon Bridge ( Zmajski most ). It represents power, courage, and greatness. Several explanations describe the origin of the Ljubljana Dragon. According to a Slavic myth, the slaying of a dragon releases the waters and ensures the fertility of the earth, and it is thought that the myth is tied to the Ljubljana Marsh , the expansive marshy area that periodically threatens Ljubljana with flooding. According to Greek legend , the Argonauts on their return home after having taken the Golden Fleece found a large lake surrounded by a marsh between the present-day towns of Vrhnika and Ljubljana. There Jason struck down a monster. This monster evolved into the dragon that today is present in the city coat of arms and flag. It is historically more believable that the dragon was adopted from Saint George , the patron of the Ljubljana Castle chapel built in the 15th century.  In the legend of Saint George, the dragon represents the old ancestral paganism overcome by Christianity . According to another explanation, related to the second, the dragon was at first only a decoration above the city coat of arms. In the Baroque , it became part of the coat of arms and, in the 19th and especially the 20th",

      "text": "retaining the original melodies but giving them new, highly sophisticated orchestral accompaniments. Song cycles Throughout his career Britten was drawn to the song cycle form. In 1928, when he was 14, he composed an orchestral cycle, Quatre chansons françaises , setting words by Victor Hugo and Paul Verlaine . Brett comments that though the work is much influenced by Wagner on the one hand and French mannerisms on the other, \"the diatonic nursery-like tune for the sad boy with the consumptive mother in 'L'enfance' is entirely characteristic.\" After he came under Auden's influence Britten composed Our Hunting Fathers (1936), ostensibly a protest against fox-hunting but which also alludes allegorically to the contemporary political state of Europe. The work has never been popular; in 1948 the critic Colin Mason lamented its neglect and called it one of Britten's greatest works. In Mason's view the cycle is \"as exciting as Les Illuminations , and offers many interesting and enjoyable foretastes of the best moments of his later works.\" Poets whose words Britten set included (clockwise from top l) Blake , Rimbaud , Owen and Verlaine The first of Britten's song cycles to gain widespread popularity was Les Illuminations (1940), for high voice (originally soprano, later more often sung by tenors) with string orchestra accompaniment, setting words by Arthur Rimbaud . Britten's music reflects the eroticism in Rimbaud's poems; Copland commented of the section \"Antique\" that he did not know how Britten dared to write the melody. \"Antique\" was dedicated to \"K.H.W.S.\", or Wulff Scherchen , Britten's first romantic interest. Matthews judges the piece the crowning masterpiece of Britten's early years. By the time of Britten's next cycle, Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo (1942) for tenor and piano, Pears had become his partner and muse; in Matthews's phrase, Britten wrote the cycle as \"his declaration of love for Peter\". It too finds the sensuality of the verses it sets, though in its structure it resembles a conventional 19th-century song cycle. Mason draws a distinction between this and Britten's earlier cycles, because here each song is self-contained, and has no thematic connection with any of the others. The Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings (1943) sets verses by a variety of poets, all on the theme of night-time. Though Britten described the cycle as \"not important stuff, but quite pleasant, I think\", it was immediately greeted as a masterpiece, and together with Peter Grimes it established him as one of the leading composers of his day. Mason calls it \"a beautifully unified work on utterly dissimilar poems, held together by the most superficial but most effective, and therefore most",

His 1913–1914 work transformed the periodic table from a chemical ordering scheme into a precise physical sequence, provided decisive experimental support for Rutherford’s nuclear atom, and laid the groundwork for the modern Aufbau principle.
