Coaches from both schools have accused each side of various episodes of poor sportsmanship over the years, and both schools have some of the nation's rowdiest home fans. The rivalry has featured some lopsided results, including a 70–14 Fresno victory over Hawaiʻi in 2004 and a 68–37 Warriors victory in 2006 over Fresno . In 2007 , allegations that Fresno State fans were physically and verbally abused by hometown Hawaiʻi fans circulated the internet and television media added to this rivalry. It was being reported that several Fresno State fans attempted to warn Boise State fans from attending Hawaiʻi football games due to potential violence against them, however no incidents were reported by Boise State fans and many photographs from Hawaiʻi-based publications covered incidents where Hawaiʻi and Boise State fans were seen mingling together before and after their 2007 game. The rivalry still continues to be one that is anticipated by both sides and continues to the present, with Fresno State having joined the Mountain West Conference in 2012, reuniting it with Hawaiʻi and other former WAC members in Nevada and Boise State. It is Hawaii's most-played rivalry series. The two teams have met 57 times, with Fresno State leading the all-time series 31–25–1. Air Force Battle for the Kuter Trophy This is one of the oldest rivalries involving Hawaii, along with the Fresno State rivalry. This rivalry is attributed to the late General Laurence S. Kuter, who was stationed on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam as commander of the Pacific Air Forces. This led to the creation of the Kuter Trophy, a symbol of sportsmanship and school pride, but also the eternal friendship between the Air Force and Hawaii. Hawaii is in possession of the trophy following their 44–35 in Colorado Springs in 2025. The two teams have met 24 times, with Air Force leading the series 14–9–1. Wyoming Battle for the Paniolo Trophy The rivalry began in 1978, when Hawaii joined the Western Athletic Conference , and was played annually until 1997, shortly before Wyoming departed from the WAC and joined the newly formed Mountain West Conference . The rivalry was renewed in 2013 when Hawaii joined the MW as a football-only affiliate member. The teams have met 29 times, with Wyoming leading the series 17–12.
