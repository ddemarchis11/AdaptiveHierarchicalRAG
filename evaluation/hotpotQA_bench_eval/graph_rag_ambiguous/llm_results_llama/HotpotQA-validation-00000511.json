Gabai also played one of the leading roles in the highly acclaimed Israeli TV series Shtisel , which to date, has run for three seasons (2013-2021).

Nuchem is an Antwerp-based travel agent who shows up at Shulem's apartment with his daughter Libbi, at the beginning of Season 2. One of Nuchem's first lines in the show is when he explains why he is late, blaming the immigration/custom officials at Ben Gurion airport, and calling them Reshaim Arrurim (Yiddish vernacular for \"accursed evil people\"). Reshaim Arrurim is a line Nuchem reprises to great comedic effect, at the slightest perceived slight, throughout the season. It was initially announced on 28 February 2018 that Gabai would reprise his role as Tewfiq in the Broadway adaptation of The Band's Visit in the summer of 2018. The lead producer of The Band's Visit , Orin Wolf, confirmed the news in a press conference on 10 June, following the 72nd Annual Tony Awards (in which The Band's Visit won ten awards, including Best Musical ).

      "text": "Bruno Richard Hauptmann (November 26, 1899 – April 3, 1936) was a German-American carpenter and criminal who was convicted of the abduction and murder of Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., the 20-month-old son of aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh . The Lindbergh kidnapping became known as the \" crime of the century \". He was executed in 1936 by electric chair at the Trenton State Prison . Both Hauptmann and his wife, Anna Hauptmann, proclaimed his innocence. In recent years, Hauptmann's guilt has been questioned by authors and researchers, and law enforcement behavior in the case has been widely criticized. Background Bruno Richard Hauptmann was born on November 26, 1899, in Kamenz , a town near Dresden in the Kingdom of Saxony , which was a state of the German Empire . He was the youngest of five children. Neither Hauptmann nor his family or friends used the name Bruno, although prosecutors in the Lindbergh kidnapping trial insisted on referring to him by that name. At age 11, Hauptmann joined the Boy Scouts ( Pfadfinderbund ). He attended public school during the day while attending trade school ( Gewerbeschule ) at night, studying carpentry for the first year, then switching to machine building ( Maschinenschlosser ) for the next two years. Hauptmann's father died in 1917. That same year, Hauptmann learned that his brother, Herman, had been killed fighting in France in World War I . Not long after that, Hauptmann was informed that another brother, Max, had also been killed while fighting in Russia . Shortly thereafter, Hauptmann was conscripted into the 67 German Army and assigned to an artillery battery. Upon receiving his orders, Hauptmann was sent to Bautzen but was transferred to the 103rd Infantry Replacement Regiment upon his arrival. In 1918, he was assigned to the 12th Machine Gun Company at Königsbrück . Hauptmann later claimed that he was deployed to western France with the 177th Regiment of Machine Gunners in either August or September 1918, then fought in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel . Hauptmann also claimed that he was gassed in September or October 1918, and that he was struck in the helmet by shrapnel from shelling, knocking him out so that he was left for dead. When Hauptmann came to, he crawled back to safety and was back on duty that evening. After the war, Hauptmann and a friend used a pistol to rob two women transporting food. His other charges include burgling a mayor's house with the use of a ladder. Released after three years in prison, Hauptmann was arrested three months later on suspicion of additional burglaries. Hauptmann illegally entered the United States by stowing away on an ocean liner. Landing in New",

The winning entrant was set on a roller coaster and was screened at Ebertfest that year. Other interests In addition to film, Ebert occasionally wrote about other topics for the Sun-Times , such as music. In 1970, Ebert wrote the first published concert review of singer-songwriter John Prine , who at the time was working as a mailman and performing at Chicago folk clubs. Ebert was a lifelong reader, and said he had \"more or less every book I have owned since I was seven, starting with Huckleberry Finn .\" Among the authors he considered indispensable were Shakespeare , Henry James , Willa Cather , Colette and Simenon . He writes of his friend William Nack : \"He approached literature like a gourmet. He relished it, savored it, inhaled it, and after memorizing it rolled it on his tongue and spoke it aloud. It was Nack who already knew in the early 1960s, when he was a very young man, that Nabokov was perhaps the supreme stylist of modern novelists. He recited to me from Lolita , and from Speak, Memory and Pnin . I was spellbound.\" Every time Ebert saw Nack, he'd ask him to recite the last lines of The Great Gatsby . Reviewing Stone Reader , he wrote: \"get me in conversation with another reader, and I'll recite titles, too. Have you ever read The Quincunx ? The Raj Quartet ? A Fine Balance ? Ever heard of that most despairing of all travel books, The Saddest Pleasure , by Moritz Thomsen? Does anybody hold up better than Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather? Know any Yeats by heart? Surely P. G. Wodehouse is as great at what he does as Shakespeare was at what he did.\" Among contemporary authors he admired Cormac McCarthy , and credited Suttree with reviving his love of reading after his illness. He also loved audiobooks , particularly praising Sean Barrett 's reading of Perfume . He was a fan of Hergé 's The Adventures of Tintin , which he read in French. Ebert first visited London in 1966 with his professor Daniel Curley , who \"started me on a lifelong practice of wandering around London. From 1966 to 2006, I visited London never less than once a year and usually more than that. Walking the city became a part of my education, and in this way I learned a little about architecture, British watercolors, music, theater and above all people. I felt",

      "text": "on the ransom notes, testimony that lumber used in constructing the ladder probably originated in Hauptmann's house, Condon's address and telephone number having been found written on the inside of one of Hauptmann's closets, and what appeared to be a hand-drawn sketch of a ladder found in one of Hauptmann's notebooks. Experts retained by the defense were never called to testify. The trial began on January 3, 1935 and lasted until February 13. During the trial, Hauptmann was identified as the man who received the ransom money, the man who had spent some of the ransom gold certificates, and as a man seen near the Lindbergh home on the day of the kidnapping. He had been absent from work on the day of the ransom payment and had quit his job two days later.  Hauptmann's attorney, Edward J. Reilly, argued that the evidence against Hauptmann was entirely circumstantial, as no reliable witness had placed Hauptmann at the scene of the crime, nor were his fingerprints found on the ladder, the ransom notes, or anywhere in the nursery. However, Hauptmann was convicted and immediately sentenced to death. His appeals failed, though his execution was stayed twice while New Jersey Governor Harold G. Hoffman reviewed the case. Execution On April 3, 1936, Hauptmann was executed in the electric chair at the New Jersey State Prison . Reporters present said that he made no statement. Hauptmann's spiritual advisor said that Hauptmann told him, before being taken from his cell, \" Ich bin absolut unschuldig an den Verbrechen, die man mir zur Last legt \" (\"I am absolutely innocent of the crimes I am accused of\"). Hauptmann's widow, Anna, had his body cremated. Two Lutheran pastors conducted a private memorial service in German. A crowd of some 2,000 gathered outside. Guilt questioned Several books have been written proclaiming Hauptmann's innocence. In 1974, Anthony Scaduto wrote Scapegoat , which took the position that Hauptmann was framed and that the police withheld and fabricated evidence. This led to further investigation, and in 1985, Scottish journalist Ludovic Kennedy published The Airman and the Carpenter , in which he argued that Hauptmann had not kidnapped and murdered Lindbergh Jr. These and other books criticize the police for allowing the crime scenes to become contaminated, Lindbergh and his associates for interfering with the investigation, Hauptmann's trial lawyers for ineffectively representing him, and the reliability of the witnesses and physical evidence presented at the trial. Kennedy in particular questioned much of the evidence, such as the origin of the ladder and the testimony of many of the witnesses. Skeptics pointed to various items of evidence that they claim was misrepresented at the trial, such as a scrawled phone number on a board in his closet, which was the number of the man who delivered the ransom, John F. Condon. According",

Key evidentiary disputes include the origin of a homemade ladder, handwriting on ransom notes, and a phone number scrawled in Hauptmann’s closet. After Hauptmann’s 1936 execution, his widow Anna spent over 50 years unsuccessfully seeking exoneration through lawsuits and appeals, while numerous books and researchers continue to question whether he was framed for the “crime of the century.”  \n\n**Keywords**: Lindbergh kidnapping, Hauptmann trial, wrongful conviction, historical controversy, forensic dispute",
