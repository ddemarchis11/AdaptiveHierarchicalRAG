      "text": "The Boeing EA-18G Growler is an American carrier-based electronic warfare aircraft , a specialized version of the two-seat Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet . The EA-18G replaced the Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowlers in service with the United States Navy . The Growler's electronic warfare capability is primarily provided by Northrop Grumman . The EA-18G began production in 2007 and entered operational service with the US Navy in late 2009. Australia has also purchased thirteen EA-18Gs, which entered service with the Royal Australian Air Force in 2017. Development Requirement and testing The first EA-18G at the roll-out ceremony on 3 August 2006 On 15 November 2001, Boeing successfully completed an initial flight demonstration of F/A-18F \"F-1\" fitted with the ALQ-99 electronic warfare system to serve as the EA-18 Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) concept aircraft. In December 2003, the US Navy awarded a development contract for the EA-18G to Boeing. As primary contractor, Boeing was to construct the forward fuselage and wings, and perform the final assembly. Northrop Grumman was the principal airframe subcontractor and they would supply the center and aft fuselage as well as the principal electronic combat system. In 2003, the Navy expected to receive 90 EA-18Gs. The first EA-18G test aircraft entered production on 22 October 2004. The first test aircraft, known as EA-1, was rolled out on 3 August 2006, before making its maiden flight at St. Louis on 15 August 2006; it was later ferried to Naval Air Station Patuxent River , Maryland on 22 September 2006. EA-1 primarily supports ground testing in the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility (ACETEF) anechoic chamber . The second aircraft (EA-2) first flew on 10 November 2006, and was delivered to NAS Patuxent River on 29 November 2006. EA-2 is an AEA flight test aircraft, initially flying on Pax River's Atlantic Test Range (ATR) for developmental test of the AEA system before transitioning to the Electronic Combat Range (ECR, or 'Echo Range') in Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California. Both aircraft are assigned to VX-23 \"Salty Dogs\". EA-1 and EA-2 are F/A-18Fs F-134 and F-135, pulled from the St. Louis production line and modified by Boeing to the EA-18G configuration. However, since they were not built initially as Growlers, the Navy has designated these two test aircraft as NEA-18Gs. There were five Growlers flying in the flight test program as of June 2008.

Their tail code is NE and their callsign is \"Bullet\". They are attached to Carrier Air Wing 2 (CVW-2), a composite unit made up of a wide array of aircraft performing a variety of combat and support missions that deploy aboard the Carl Vinson . History Four distinct squadrons have been designated VF-2. Officially, the US Navy does not recognize a direct lineage with disestablished squadrons if a new squadron is formed with the same designation. Often, the new squadron will assume the nickname, insignia, and traditions of the earlier squadrons. 1970s VF-2 F-14As aboard USS Enterprise during their first deployment, 1975 VF-2, known as the \"Bounty Hunters,\" was established on 14 October 1972 flying the F-14A Tomcat . VF-2 completed aircrew training and received its first Tomcats in July 1973, attaining full strength of 12 F-14As in the spring of 1974. VF-2's initial deployment was in 1974 with her sister squadron VF-1 aboard USS Enterprise . The squadron flew over Saigon in support of Operation Frequent Wind , the evacuation of US personnel in April, 1975. Deployed on USS Enterprise Westpac 1978 Ports of call: Pearl Harbor Hawaii, Subic Bay Philippines, Singapore, Perth Australia, Hong Kong 1980s VF-2 F-14A equipped with AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles, 1988 VF-2 was assigned to USS Ranger for the September 1980 deployment, 4 months of which were spent in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf during the Iran hostage crisis . The squadron was the first Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System ( TARPS ) unit for both CVW-14 and later CVW-2 . VF-2 deployed aboard USS Kitty Hawk in 1984 In March 1984, Kitty Hawk participated in \" Team Spirit \" exercises in the Sea of Japan . The Soviet Victor-class nuclear attack submarine K-314 shadowed the task group. On 21 March, at the conclusion of the Sea of Japan part of the exercise, K-314 surfaced directly in front of Kitty Hawk , and at 22:05 hrs, too dark and far too close for Kitty Hawk to see and avoid the resulting collision, the vessels came in contact, resulting in minor damage to the carrier, and significant damage to the Soviet submarine. Kitty Hawk reported to the U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay in the Philippines for repairs. A piece of one of K-314 ' s propellers was embedded in Kitty Hawk ' s",

      "text": "suitable\" in February 2011. Prime contractor Boeing is working to address issues with software updates. In December 2011, Operational Test and Evaluation concluded that the EA-18G software was \"operationally effective and suitable\". On 19 December 2014, the Navy publicly reported that it wants to modify the production contract with Boeing to slow production of the Growler from three airplanes per month to two. It will also purchase an additional 15 Growlers, funded by a spending bill that will go to President Obama for signature in late December 2014. Boeing would then be able to continue running the St. Louis production line through 2017. Boeing has said it cannot sustain the production line at fewer than two airplanes per month. [ needs update ] Design An EA-18G Growler of test and evaluation squadron VX-9 , carrying external fuel tanks, jamming pods, and AGM-88 HARM and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. The Growler's flight performance is similar to that of the F/A-18E/F. This attribute enables the Growler to perform escort jamming as well as the traditional standoff jamming mission ( radar jamming and deception ). Growlers are able to accompany F/A-18s during all phases of an attack mission. In order to give the Growler more stable flight for the electronic warfare mission, Boeing changed the leading edge fairings and wing fold hinge fairings, and added wing fences and aileron \"tripper strips\". The Growler has more than 90% in common with the standard Super Hornet, sharing airframe, Raytheon AN/APG-79 AESA radar and weapon systems such as the AN/AYK-22 stores management system. Most of the dedicated airborne electronic attack equipment is mounted on a plate in the space that used to house the internal 20 mm cannon and on the wingtips. Nine weapons stations remain free to provide for additional weapons or jamming pods. The added electronics include AN/ALQ-218 wideband receivers on the wingtips and ALQ-99 high and low-band tactical jamming pods . The ALQ-218 combined with the ALQ-99 form a full spectrum electronic warfare suite that is able to provide detection and jamming against all known surface-to-air threats. However, the current pods may be inadequate against emerging threats. The EA-18G can be fitted with up to five ALQ-99 jamming pods and will typically add two AIM-120 AMRAAM or AGM-88 HARM missiles. The EA-18G will also use the INCANS Interference Cancellation system that will allow voice communication while jamming enemy communications, a capability not available on the EA-6B. In addition to the radar warning and jamming equipment, the Growler possesses a communications receiver and jamming system that will provide suppression and electronic attack against airborne communication threats.

The aircraft was written off on 15 August and the Australian Government is attempting to claim compensation for the loss of the A$125 million aircraft. On 9 December 2020, the Royal Australian Air Force announced that the 11 EA-18G Growlers and 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets had been grounded after an incident occurred where the crew of an RAAF F/A-18F had to eject on take-off. On 30 September 2021, the US State Department approved the sale of an EA-18G to Australia to replace that lost in the 2018 accident. This aircraft was ordered in early 2022, with the price being up to US$125 million. It was acquired from the US Navy's stock of Growlers and modified to the same configuration as the other Australian aircraft before being delivered to the RAAF. The aircraft was delivered to the RAAF in February 2023. In February 2023, a A$2 billion project to upgrade the RAAF's Growlers and support infrastructure was approved and awarded to Boeing . As part of the project, new radar infrastructure will be installed at RAAF Base Amberley and the Delamere Air Weapons Range . The Growlers will also be fitted with improved sensors, longer-range missiles and new jamming pods.

      "text": "The Mikoyan MiG-29 ( Russian : Микоян МиГ-29 ; NATO reporting name : Fulcrum ) is a twin-engine fighter aircraft designed in the Soviet Union . Developed by the Mikoyan design bureau as an air superiority fighter during the 1970s, the MiG-29, along with the larger Sukhoi Su-27 , was developed to counter U.S. fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon . The MiG-29 entered service with the Soviet Air Forces in 1983. While originally oriented towards combat against any enemy aircraft, many MiG-29s have been furnished as multirole fighters capable of performing a number of different operations, and are commonly outfitted to use a range of air-to-surface armaments and precision munitions . The MiG-29 has been manufactured in several major variants, including the multirole Mikoyan MiG-29M and the navalised Mikoyan MiG-29K ; the most advanced member of the family to date is the Mikoyan MiG-35 . Later models frequently feature improved engines, glass cockpits with HOTAS (\"hands-on-throttle-and-stick\")-compatible flight controls, modern radar and infrared search and track (IRST) sensors, and considerably increased fuel capacity; some aircraft have also been equipped for aerial refueling . Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the militaries of multiple ex-Soviet republics have continued to operate the MiG-29, the largest of them being the Russian Aerospace Forces . The Russian Aerospace Forces wanted to upgrade its existing fleet to the modernised MiG-29SMT configuration, but financial difficulties have limited deliveries. The MiG-29 has also been a popular export aircraft; more than 30 nations either operate or have operated the aircraft. As of 2024 [update] Flight Global estimates that 809 MiG-29s, of all types, are in service with air forces, making it the 5th most common active fighter. Development Origins In the mid-1960s, the United States Air Force (USAF) encountered difficulties over the skies of Vietnam. Supersonic fighter bombers that had been optimized for low altitude bombing, like the F-105 Thunderchief , were found to be vulnerable to older MiG-17s and more advanced MiGs which were much more maneuverable. In order to regain limited air superiority, the US refocused on air combat using the F-4 Phantom multirole fighter, while the Soviet Union developed the MiG-23 in response. Towards the end of the 1960s, the USAF started the \"F-X\" program to produce a fighter dedicated to air superiority, which led to the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle being ordered for production in late 1969. At the height of the Cold War , a Soviet response was necessary to",

Both variants feature radar-absorbent coatings, modern avionics including helmet-mounted targeting, and full weapon compatibility with MiG-29M/SMT standards. The MiG-29KUB, while primarily a trainer, retains full combat capability and shares the same airframe size and NATO code “Fulcrum-D” as the single-seater.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nMiG-29K, naval aviation, Indian Navy, carrier-based fighter, Fulcrum-D",

Key design features include widely-spaced Klimov RD-33 engines that reduce wing loading and boost agility, variable intake ramps under large LERXs for high-Mach flight, and rough-field adaptations such as closable main inlets and dorsal auxiliary louvers (deleted on the latest MiG-35). Range grows from 1,500 km clean to 2,100 km with drop tanks, aided on newer models by in-flight refueling probes. The mid-mounted swept wing with automatic slats, composite/aluminum 9-g airframe and hydromechanical flight controls give excellent high-alpha maneuverability, though early cockpits lacked HOTAS and modern avionics. Continuous upgrades produced variants like the MiG-29S, MiG-29K, MiG-29M/SMT and MiG-35, adding glass cockpits, improved sensors, greater fuel and multirole capability, while export success kept ~800 aircraft active worldwide.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nMiG-29, RD-33 engines, LERX intakes, fighter agility, Fulcrum variants",
