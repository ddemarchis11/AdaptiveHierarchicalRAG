      "text": "Lawrence is a village within the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County , on Long Island , in New York , United States. It is located adjacent to the border with the New York City borough of Queens to the west and is near the Reynolds Channel to the south. The population was 6,809 at the time of the 2020 census. Lawrence is one of the \" Five Towns ,\" which consist of the villages of Lawrence and Cedarhurst , the hamlets (unincorporated areas) of Woodmere and Inwood , and \"The Hewletts\", which is made up of the hamlet of Hewlett together with the villages of Hewlett Bay Park , Hewlett Harbor and Hewlett Neck , along with Woodsburgh . History Old Lawrence, or Back Lawrence, is a part of the village, comprising many large homes, mansions, beach side villas and former plantations with very large property, a few dating back to the time of the American Revolution . This area, like Hewlett is unique because its rural affluence is similar in character to the more well known Gold Coast of the North Shore instead of being more urbanized like the rest of the South Shore of Nassau County . One of the area's oldest structures, Rock Hall – once home to two prominent families, the Martins and Hewletts – was constructed during colonial times and is now an active museum, Hewlett still being the most expensive city in the 5 towns. Beginning in 1869, a railroad line was completed which originated in New York City and ran through the part of Long Island now called The Five Towns. Part of the land in that area was acquired by three brothers with the surname \"Lawrence,\" which is who the Village was eventually named after. During the second half of the 19th century, it was a main vacation spot for the wealthy families until the 1890s. A series of hurricanes and nor'easters altered the coastline considerably and destroyed a large beachfront hotel. Lawrence could no longer boast direct access to the sands along the Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, Lawrence began to become a suburb , a village with schools, public facilities, better roads and a large town area that expanded into what it is now today. In 1897, Lawrence incorporated as a village. This enabled it to gain local control of zoning and govern itself through municipal home rule . Lawrence, or most notably Old Lawrence, was formerly home to a large upper class of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant families who lived there since the time of the American Revolution . From the 1940s to 1980s, it became a center of Reform and Conservative Jewish life that included the largest Reform synagogue on Long Island (Temple Israel). Many noteworthy residents grew up in Lawrence during this period. In the late 1980s, Lawrence saw a large migration of Modern Orthodox Jews.

Large-scale abandonments of lines began in the late 1950s, usually associated with highway or bridge work. 1960s and Skybus 1970s In the 1960s a 92-mile (148 km) automated guideway transit system was planned fanning out to the north, south, east, southeast and west, including connections to both the Pittsburgh International Airport and the Allegheny County Airport , Monroeville Mall and adjacent to Kennywood Amusement Park. The modern subway and light rail system can be traced to the abandonment of the proposed \"Skybus\" system in the mid-1970s, and the subsequent $265 million federal grant on May 7, 1979, for construction of a downtown subway and modernization of suburban light rail.  Modern system Train of CAF LRV rolling stock crossing the Monongahela River on the Panhandle Bridge Downtown subway and Beechview Line (Stage I) PRT, working with community representatives and government officials, undertook a detailed study on the future of the South Hills trolley lines, resolving to transform these valuable, high-density transit corridors into a modern LRT system. The resulting Stage I LRT plan achieved a comprehensive reconstruction and upgrading of the 10.5-mile (16.9 km) \"main line\" between downtown and the suburbs of Bethel Park and Upper St. Clair via Mt. Lebanon and Beechview—basically following the Skybus alignment. The crowning achievement was to be a 1.1-mile (1.8 km) downtown subway, eliminating the trolleys' slow, street-running loop through Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle.  On December 10, 1980, after receiving federal funding, Pittsburgh Regional Transit began construction on Stage One of its first \"modern\" light rail/subway service, the \"T\", which used a former Pittsburgh Railways trolley route to connect Downtown Pittsburgh to the South Hills. Stage One began with two construction projects, the downtown subway and the former trolley route from the newly constructed South Hills Village Station and Light Rail Maintenance Center to Castle Shannon, both ends working toward the middle section of the route. Steel Plaza subway station , the most utilized station on the system The first trolley cars on the modernized trackage began operation from South Hills Village to Castle Shannon on April 15, 1984. The downtown subway opened on July 3, 1985, initially with fare-free \"demonstration\" service running only as far as the then-new Station Square station for the first few days. The last day of streetcar service running on streets in downtown and across the historic Smithfield Street Bridge was July 6, 1985, with the subway opening for full service on July 7.",

      "text": "Location of East Islip on Long Island East Islip is a hamlet and CDP in the Town of Islip , Suffolk County, New York , United States. The population was 13,931 at the time of the 2020 census. History Originally referred to as \"East of Islip\", the name was acquired in 1890 from the estate of William Nicoll, an English aristocrat who purchased the surrounding land in 1683 to erect a family residence. Nicoll's purchase comprised 51,000 acres (210 km 2 ) from the Secatogue Indians, reaching as far as Bayport to the east, Babylon to the west and Ronkonkoma to the north. His mansion, Islip Grange, named after his family's ancestral estate at Northampshire, England , stood near the shoreline of what is now Heckscher State Park . East Islip, as well as many hamlets along Long Island's south shore, was once an enclave for some of the nation's wealthiest families. Its estates at one time included the Hollins, Gulden, and Knapp estates, among others. An original estate mansion, Brookwood Hall, has passed from its last private owners, the Thorne family (originally of Great Neck during the Dutch colonial era) and now serves as a municipal building for the Town of Islip. The Bradish Johnson estate known as Woodland Lodge became the home of the Hewlett School, a private boarding school which closed shortly after the turn of the century. Some estate and early farmlands were donated to the Roman Catholic church and make up the current grounds of St Mary's of East Islip, which includes a private elementary and middle school, in addition to church and other parish buildings. The original Westbrook farm on the boundary between East Islip and Oakdale , near the Bayard Cutting Arboretum, has ceased operations, and its fields are now the home of East Islip Soccer, near the fields set aside for the Little League of the Islips. Today, modern East Islip is composed of much smaller, yet affluent communities and few estates . Many of these newer communities were built on the land that was once part of former estates that were sold off, most notably the estate of Percy G. Williams. The Moorings , an opulent waterfront guard-gated private community , is one of the hamlet's premier neighborhoods. Other neighborhoods within the hamlet include Deer Run and Country Village as well as the Beecher Estates.
