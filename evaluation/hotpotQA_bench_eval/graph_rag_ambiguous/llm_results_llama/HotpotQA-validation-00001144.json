Jon Peters unified all the film's tie-ins , even turning down $6 million from General Motors to build the Batmobile because the car company would not relinquish creative control. During production, Peters read in The Wall Street Journal that comic book fans were unsatisfied with the casting of Michael Keaton. In response, Peters rushed the first film trailer that played in thousands of theaters during Christmas. It was simply an assemblage of scenes without music, but created enormous anticipation for the film, with audiences clapping and cheering. DC Comics allowed screenwriter Sam Hamm to write his own comic book miniseries . Hamm's stories were collected in the graphic novel Batman: Blind Justice ( ISBN 978-1563890475 ). Denys Cowan and Dick Giordano illustrated the artwork. Blind Justice tells the story of Bruce Wayne trying to solve a series of murders connected to WayneTech . It also marks the first appearance of Henri Ducard , who was later used in the rebooted Batman Begins (2005), albeit as an alias for the more notable Ra's al Ghul . In the months leading up to Batman ' s release in June 1989, a popular culture phenomenon known as \" Batmania \" began. Over $750 million worth of merchandise was sold. Cult filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith remembered: \"That summer was huge. You couldn't turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads. It was just the summer of Batman and if you were a comic book fan it was pretty hot.\" Hachette Book Group USA published a novelization, Batman , written by Craig Shaw Gardner . It remained on The New York Times Best Seller list throughout June 1989. Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of The New York Observer categorized Batman as a high concept film. He believed \"it is less movie than a corporate behemoth \". Reception Box office Batman grossed $2.2 million in late night previews on June 22, 1989, on 1,215 screens and grossed $40.49 million in 2,194 theaters during its opening weekend. This broke the opening weekend records held by Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (which had a 4-day Memorial Day weekend gross of $37.0 million the previous month) and Ghostbusters II (which had a $29.4 million 3-day weekend the previous weekend). Upon opening, the film would go on to reach the number one spot above Honey, I Shrunk the Kids . Additionally, it had the largest opening weekend for a Jack Nicholson film for 14 years until it was dethroned by Anger Management in 2003.

      "text": "The Volvo S40 is a series of subcompact executive cars marketed and produced by the Swedish manufacturer Volvo Cars from 1995 to 2012, offered as a more mainstream alternative to the compact executive Volvo 850 and later the Volvo S60 to compete in a lower pricing bracket. The S40 was more or less positioned against premium-leaning small family cars like the Volkswagen Jetta , as well as some mass-market large family cars . The first generation (1995–2004) was introduced in 1995 with the S40 (S from saloon) and V40 (V from versatility, estate) cars. The second generation was released in 2003, and the estate variant became differentiated from the sedan, having its name changed to V50 . The range was replaced by the Volvo V40 five door hatchback in 2012. First generation (1995–2004) During August 1995, Volvo released its new series, intending to call the cars S4 and F4. However, as Audi had already reserved the \"S4\" name, Volvo opted to name the range S40 (saloon), and V40 (estate). These cars were manufactured at the Nedcar factory at Born in the Netherlands (a pre Ford joint venture between Volvo and Mitsubishi Motors ) and based on a common platform with the Mitsubishi Carisma , later used by the Proton Waja . They were also the last Volvos to be produced at the Born plant; a lineage that had begun in the early 1970s with Volvo's collaboration with DAF that had led to the Volvo 66 and the Volvo 300 series . In the United Kingdom, it costs approximately 50% more than the related Mitsubishi Carisma. The car helped change perceptions of Volvo: \"The S40/V40 range was the car that finally persuaded buyers that Volvo really could build a credible compact executive car\", reported the RAC. For the 2000 model year, Volvo expanded the S40/V40's market to North America, where this range went on sale exclusively with the 1.9 liter turbo. The V40, with a drag coefficient of 0.32, was the first whole model to be introduced under the direction of the British designer Peter Horbury , Volvo’s design director and was marketed in Australia, South America and the Far East. The V40 was named the \"Most Beautiful Estate Car in the World\" at an Italian award ceremony. The official premiere was at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1995, with the V40 premiering in December 1995, at the Bologna Motor Show . In July 2000, Volvo updated the 40 Series (\"Phase II\"), implementing several technical improvements, including improved engine management, diesel direct fuel injection, extra safety features, larger brake discs, new front suspension and steering, revised rear suspension, larger tyres and a wider track. A minor facelift gave more streamlining, slightly different front wings",

However, in 2019, Chipotle paid $6.5 million to settle a lawsuit where the plaintiffs claimed that the company's food \"may have been sourced from livestock that consumed GMO animal feed\". In 2017, Chipotle committed to transitioning away from birds bred to maximize growth at the expense of animal well-being. However, in 2024, investigations by animal welfare groups showed that they were failing to meet these standards. Food safety In its annual reports, Chipotle has acknowledged that it \"may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation\". Following the 2015 outbreaks, some food safety experts and media commentators argued that the variety of pathogens involved pointed to systemic problems with the company's food handling practices.

The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time. Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.
