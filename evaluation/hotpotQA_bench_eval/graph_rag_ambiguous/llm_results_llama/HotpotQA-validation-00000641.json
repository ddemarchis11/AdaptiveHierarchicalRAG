While his acting career grew, Cedric continued to perform stand-up comedy and traveled the country as one of the Kings of Comedy headliners with Steve Harvey, D. L. Hughley and Bernie Mac . The act was later made into a Spike Lee film, The Original Kings of Comedy (2000). From 2002-2003, Cedric had his own sketch comedy show, Cedric the Entertainer Presents , but after being renewed for a second season, it was canceled by Fox before the season began. He took time to write a book, Grown-A$$ Man. He appeared in the 2003 video game Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 . He recorded comedic interludes on two Nelly albums, Country Grammar (2000) and Nellyville (2002) as well as on Jay-Z 's The Black Album (2003). A more recent HBO Comedy Special was Cedric The Entertainer: Taking You Higher in 2006. Cedric began appearing in films, including Ride (1998), Big Momma's House (2000), Barbershop (2002), and its sequels Barbershop 2: Back in Business (2004) and Barbershop: The Next Cut (2016), Serving Sara (2002), Intolerable Cruelty (2003), Johnson Family Vacation (2004), Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004), Man of the House (2005) and Be Cool (2005). He was the subject of controversy when his Barbershop character made unpopular remarks about Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks . These jokes (about the pastor's promiscuity with women, and Parks just being tired to get to the back of the bus) were spoken in character, as part of the script. Rev. Jesse Jackson publicly asked for those jokes to be edited out of the movie on the DVD and VHS releases. Cedric also voiced the character of Bobby Proud in the series The Proud Family (2001-2005), and starting in 2022, its revival series The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder , and characters in several films including Zoo Bear #1 in Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001) and Carl in Ice Age (2002).

      "text": "The expression \" macaroni and cheese \" is an example of irreversible binomial. The order of the two keywords of this familiar expression are normally not reversed. In linguistics and stylistics , an irreversible binomial , frozen binomial , binomial freeze , binomial expression , binomial pair , or nonreversible word pair is a pair of words, used together, in fixed order, as an idiomatic expression or collocation . The words typically have a semantic relationship, usually involving the word and or or . They also belong to the same part of speech : for example: nouns (e.g., milk and honey ); adjectives ( short and sweet ); or verbs ( do or die ). Usually (as with the preceding examples) the order of such word elements will not be reversed. The term \"irreversible binomial\" was introduced by Yakov Malkiel in 1954, though various aspects of the phenomenon had been discussed, since at least 1903, under different names: a \"terminological imbroglio\". Ernest Gowers used the name Siamese twins (i.e., conjoined twins ) in the 1965 edition of Fowler's Modern English Usage . The 2015 edition reverts to the scholarly name, \"irreversible binomials\", as \"Siamese twins\" had become \" politically incorrect \". Many irreversible binomials are catchy due to alliteration , rhyming , or ablaut reduplication , so becoming clichés or catchphrases . Idioms like rock and roll , the birds and the bees , and collocations like mix and match , and wear and tear have particular meanings apart from or beyond those of their constituent words. Ubiquitous collocations like loud and clear and life or death are fixed expressions , making them a standard part of the vocabulary of native English speakers. Some English words have become obsolete in general but are still found in an irreversible binomial. For example, spick is a fossil word that never appears outside the phrase spick and span . Some other words, like vim in vim and vigor or abet in aid and abet , have become rare and archaic outside the collocation. Numerous irreversible binomials are used in legalese . Due to the use of precedent in common law , many lawyers use the same collocations found in legal documents centuries old. Many of these legal doublets contain two synonyms, often one of Old English origin and the other of Latin origin: deposes and says , ways and means . While many irreversible binomials are literal expressions (like washer and dryer, rest and relaxation, rich and famous, savings and loan ), some are entirely figurative (like come hell or high water, nip and tuck, surf and turf ) or mostly so (like between a rock and a hard place, five and dime ). Somewhat in between are more subtle figures of speech , synecdoches , metaphors , or hyperboles (like",

The deeper metaphysical lyrics to \"Mine All Mine\" were rewritten seven times, with Hagar saying \"it was the first time in my life I ever beat myself up, hurt myself, punished myself, practically threw things through windows, trying to write the lyrics.\" Although it was considered a joke song, \"Source of Infection\" was written about Eddie's hospitalization with dengue fever during his vacation in Australia in April 1988, celebrating his seventh wedding anniversary with Valerie Bertinelli . The working title was Bone , which Alex hated. Hagar then decided on OU812 after seeing this on the side of a delivery truck on the freeway and finding it funny (rumors persist, though, that the title was a disguised response to the title of David Lee Roth's 1986 solo album, Eat 'Em and Smile ). OU812 is seen in Cheech and Chong's Next Movie (1980) on the license plate of the car given to Cheech at the \"Comedy House\" when he was leaving. It was also scribbled on the cinderblock column on which is mounted the payphone that the cab drivers used in the TV sitcom Taxi (1978–1983). The album's front cover is a homage to the classic cover of With the Beatles . The cover features a black and white photo of the band member's faces partly hidden in shadows, and is also similar to that of Blue Cheer 's Vincebus Eruptum (1968) and King Crimson 's Red (1974). Album artwork for the back cover is Hugo Rheinhold 's statuette Affe mit Schädel . The track listing on the back cover is arranged in alphabetical order, instead of in sequence on most releases. The album is dedicated to Eddie and Alex's father, Jan, who died on December 9, 1986, at the age of 66. The inner linings of the album include the words, \"This one's for you, Pa\". Jan had previously appeared playing clarinet on one track, \"Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)\", on Van Halen's 1982 album, Diver Down . Critical reception Reviews for OU812 were initially mixed. Robert Christgau rated the album a C in The Village Voice , which signifies \"a record of clear professionalism or barely discernible inspiration, but not both.\" He noted that \"trading Dave for Sammy sure wrecked their shot at Led Zep of the '80s--master guitarist, signature vocalist, underrated rhythm section.\" However, he stated: \"Eddie's obsessed with technique, Roth's contemptuous of technique, rhythm section's got enough technique and no klutz genius.

But Sammy . . . like wow. If I can't claim the new boy owns them [...], you can't deny he defines them.\" Rolling Stone ' s David Fricke rated the album three-and-a-half out of five stars. He said of \"Source of Infection\": \"While Eddie Van Halen sprays you with a machine-gun succession of speed-metal-guitar arpeggios, Sammy Hagar sends out the party invitations with his usual savoir-faire — \"Hey! All right! Whoo!\" Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony, of course, take him at his word, shooting into hyper-beat space before you can say, 'Jump'.\" He noted that \"Van Halen, contrary to purist grumbling, did not wimp out when Diamond Dave hit the bricks. Nor did the band go — ugh! — pop: the 5150 ladies' choice \" Why Can't This Be Love \" wasn't really a ballad; it was more like Big Rock Melancholia. In fact, all the 5150 -model Van Halen did was replace one mighty mouth with another and trot out some hip, new songwriting tricks.\" Still, he stated that \"the curve balls [...] don't always hit the strike zone. \"Finish What Ya Started\" is an unexpected turn into wheat-field-rock country.\" Despite this, he concluded that \"maybe Eddie and company haven't been pushing the envelope, so to speak, far enough in terms of songwriting. But \"Mine All Mine\" is a good teaser for the future, the slow stuff is classy radio fare, and at its best, OU812 is a veritable feast of great white rock & roll wow.\" Xavier Russell of Kerrang! was more enthusiastic and called OU812 \"loud, rude, dirty and very much a Van Halen album\". A retrospective review from AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was fairly positive. Erlewine stated that \"when David Lee Roth fronted the band, almost everything that Van Halen did seemed easy – as big, boisterous, and raucous as an actual party – but Van Hagar makes good times seem like tough work here.\" Still, he stated that \"the riffs are complicated, not catchy, the rhythms plod, they don't rock, and Sammy strains to inject some good times by singing too hard.\" However, he concluded that \"if it isn't as good as Fair Warning (even if it's nearly not as much fun), it's nevertheless the best showcase of the instrumental abilities of Van Hagar.\" Canadian journalist Martin Popoff defined OU812 music as \"cynical corporate rock\" and found the album \"over-produced and actually more commonplace\" than its predecessor 5150 , implying",

      "text": "Put , occasionally Putt , is an English tavern game first recorded in the 16th century and later castigated by 17th century moralists as one of ill repute. It belongs to a very ancient family of trick-taking card games and bears close similarities a group known as Truc, Trut, Truque , also Tru , and the South American game Truco . Its more elaborate cousin is the Catelan and Spanish game of Truc , which is still much played in many parts of Southern France and Spain. Etymology The name Put, pronounced \"uh\" like the \"u\" in the English village of Putney, derives from \"putting up your cards in case\", if you do not like them, or from \"putting each other to the shift\". Cotton spells it Putt. History Put is mentioned as early as 1662 where the opening line of a poem, The Riddle , says \"S-hall's have a Game at Put, to pass away the time...\" It appears in a compendium of poems and songs from the period 1639–1661. The rules of Put are recorded as early as the 1670s by Willughby and Cotton. At that time it was considered a very disreputable game, \"the ordinary rooking game of every place\", rooking meaning \"cheating\". Its reputation was such that Crawley (1876) cites an early play as saying \"if you want to be robbed, my son, play Put in a tavern.\" It was a game of the servants' quarters along with loo , whist and all fours . Cotton's rules were reprinted in various editions of The Compleat Gamester until 1750 and sporadically copied into the 19th century. No new information appears until around 1800 with Pigott and Jones' versions of Hoyle's Games . During the 19th century most sources copy these texts almost verbatim. Put died out during the 19th century, but not before having influenced Brag . Put (17th/18th century) The following description is based on the two earliest sources: Willughby (1672) and Cotton (1674). Put was almost invariably a two-hand game, although Willughby includes extra rules for any number of players and Cotton suggests three may also play. A full 52-card English pattern pack is used with cards ranking in the unusual order of 3-2-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4 in each suit. The game is won by the first player to score 5 points (a \"Putt\") or 7 points over as many deals as necessary. The player drawing the highest Put-card (Threes high, Fours low) deals first, and the deal then alternates. The dealer shuffles and non-dealer cuts. The dealer then gives three cards each,",

Using a full 52-card pack ranked 3-2-A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4, players compete to win two of three tricks per deal, scoring points toward a target of 5 or 7. A key strategic element is the optional “Put” bid, daring the opponent to play for the entire game stake. Variants include four-handed play and French Le Truc. Despite its disrepute, Put influenced later games like Brag and appears in 17th-century literature and riddles.\n\n**Keywords**: Put card game, trick-taking, 17th-century gambling, Le Truc, Brag",
