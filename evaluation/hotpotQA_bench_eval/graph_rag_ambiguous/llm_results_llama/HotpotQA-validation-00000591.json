      "text": "Quantrill's Raiders were the best-known of the pro- Confederate partisan guerrillas (also known as \" bushwhackers \") who fought in the American Civil War . Their leader was William Quantrill and they included Jesse James and his brother Frank .  Early in the war Missouri and Kansas were nominally under Union government control and became subject to widespread violence as groups of Confederate bushwhackers and anti-slavery Jayhawkers competed for control. The town of Lawrence, Kansas , was a center of anti-slavery sentiment. In August 1863, Quantrill led an attack on the town, killing more than 180 civilians. The Confederate government, which had granted Quantrill a field commission under the Partisan Ranger Act , was outraged and withdrew support for such irregular forces.  By 1864 Quantrill had lost control of the group, which split up into small bands. Some, including Quantrill, were killed in various engagements. Others lived on to hold reunions many years later, when the name Quantrill's Raiders began to be used. The James brothers formed their own gang and conducted robberies for years as a continuing insurgency in the region. Origins The Missouri - Kansas border area was fertile ground for the outbreak of guerrilla warfare when the Civil War erupted in 1861. The historian Albert Castel wrote: For over six years, ever since Kansas was opened up as a territory by Stephen A. Douglas ' Kansas-Nebraska Bill of 1854, its prairies had been the stage for an almost incessant series of political conventions, raids, massacres, pitched battles, and atrocities, all part of a fierce conflict between the Free State and pro-slavery forces that had come to Kansas to settle and to battle. In February 1861, Missouri voters elected delegates to a statewide convention, which rejected secession by a vote of 89–1. Unionists, led by regular US Army commander Nathaniel Lyon and Frank Blair of the politically-powerful Blair family, fought for political and military control across the state against the increasingly pro-secessionist forces, led by Governor Claiborne Jackson and future Confederate General Sterling Price . By June, open warfare occurred between Union forces and troops supporting the Confederacy. Guerrilla warfare erupted throughout the state and intensified in August after the Union defeat at the Battle of Wilson's Creek . One historical work describes the situation in the state after Wilson's Creek: Unlike other border areas in Maryland and Kentucky, local conflicts, bushwhacking, sniping, and guerrilla fighting marked this period of Missouri history. \"When regular troops were absent, the improvised war often assumed a deadly guerrilla nature as local citizens took up arms spontaneously against their neighbors. This was a war of stealth and raid without a front, without formal organization, and with almost no division between the civilian and the warrior.\" By August 1862, with the Union victory at the Battle",

Joseph Swing , landed unopposed at Nasugbu in southern Luzon and began moving north toward Manila. Meanwhile, the 11th Airborne's 511th Regimental Combat Team, commanded by Col.

Japanese defense Map of the capture of Manila As the Americans converged on Manila from different directions, they discovered that most of the Imperial Japanese Army troops defending the city had been withdrawn to Baguio on the orders of General Tomoyuki Yamashita , commander in chief of Japanese Army forces in the Philippines. Yamashita had planned to engage Filipino and U.S. forces in northern Luzon in a coordinated campaign of attrition, with the goal of buying time for defenses against an Allied invasion to be constructed on the Japanese home islands. He had three main force groupings under his command: 80,000 men of the \"Shimbu Group\" in the mountains east of Manila, 30,000 of the \"Kembu Group\" in the hills north of Manila, and 152,000 of the \"Shobu Group\" in northeastern Luzon. Yamashita decided not to declare Manila an open city , as General Douglas MacArthur had done before its capture by Japanese forces in 1941. This was based on concerns that doing so would tarnish the \"fighting spirit\" of the Japanese military, not because Yamashita intended to seriously defend the city; he did not think that he could feed the city's one million residents, and doubted his forces' ability to defend a large area with vast tracts of flammable wooden buildings. While not planning to fight over Manila itself, Yamashita did order the commander of \"Shimbu Group\", Gen. Shizuo Yokoyama , to destroy all bridges and other vital installations in the area and then evacuate his men from the city as soon as American troops arrived in force. In spite of these orders, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi , commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy 's 31st Naval Special Base Force, was determined to fight a last-ditch battle in Manila. Though nominally part of the Shimbu Group, Iwabuchi repeatedly ignored orders to withdraw from the city. The naval staff in Japan agreed to Iwabuchi's scheme, subverting Yamashita's attempts to confront the",

Bale plays a rancher impoverished by drought who takes on the dangerous but lucrative job of taking a notorious outlaw (Crowe) to justice. It is the second adaptation of Elmore Leonard 's 1953 short story \" Three-Ten to Yuma \", after the 1957 film of the same name . Filming took place in various locations in New Mexico . 3:10 to Yuma opened September 7, 2007, in the United States and received positive reviews from critics. It grossed $71 million worldwide on a budget of $48–55 million. Plot In 1884 Arizona Territory , Dan Evans is a poor rancher and Civil War veteran who owes money to Glen Hollander, a local banker in the town of Bisbee . Hollander's men burn down his barn and scatter his cattle as a warning to pay his debts. The next morning, Evans and his two sons search for their herd but stumble upon Ben Wade and his gang robbing a stagecoach staffed by Pinkertons . Wade sees Evans and his two sons watching from the hills and decides that they are not a threat to his gang. He takes their horses to prevent them from giving warning about the robbery. Wade promises to leave the horses tied up \"on the road to Bisbee \", so that Evans can recover them. After Wade's gang departs, Evans rescues the lone surviving coach guard, Pinkerton Agent Byron McElroy. Wade and his gang ride to Bisbee to drink at the local saloon and divide up their loot. The gang departs but Wade chooses to stay behind to enjoy the company of the barmaid. Evans brings McElroy to veterinarian/lawman Doc Potter to tend his wounds and tries in vain to negotiate his debt with Hollander. Evans finds Wade emerging from an upstairs room in the saloon and coaxes a few dollars from Wade over the trouble he caused Evans. As the two talk, lawmen surround the saloon and arrest Wade. Grayson Butterfield, the railroad's representative, hires a posse consisting of McElroy, Potter, and Tucker (one of Hollander's men) to take Wade to Contention . They are to put Wade on the 3:10 afternoon train to Yuma Territorial Prison . Evans asks for $200 to help deliver Wade, in order to pay his debt to Hollander. Butterfield agrees, and the newly formed posse meet at Evans's ranch. McElroy arranges for a decoy wagon to distract Wade's gang in pursuit. During the journey, Tucker and McElroy provoke",

Japanese massacres, American artillery bombardment, and house-to-house fighting obliterated the city’s Spanish-colonial and early-American architectural heritage, with only two buildings in the business district surviving intact. After the Japanese garrison ignored orders to withdraw, U.S. troops systematically reduced strongholds such as Intramuros, Rizal Stadium, and Fort San Antonio Abad, counting 16,665 Japanese dead inside the Walled City alone. The battle’s aftermath saw General Yamashita executed for war crimes and Manila’s transformation from the “Pearl of the Orient” to a modernist American-style capital.

Initial plans faced delays due to intelligence updates, and the landing on two distant beaches was later deemed a tactical error. Poor topographical intelligence led to high casualties for the 3rd Marine Division, though naval gunfire and LVTs proved effective. Post-battle, Guam transformed into a major U.S. military hub, with extensive airfield and harbor construction supporting B-29 operations and later conflicts.

After overcoming fierce resistance at key points like Bundschu Ridge, Chonito Cliff, and Fonte Plateau, American units linked their northern and southern beachheads. Japanese commander Takashina launched a costly counterattack that failed, after which he shifted to guerrilla tactics before being killed.

      "summary": "**Title**: Mountain West Conference Evolution\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe Mountain West Conference (MW) was founded in 1999 by eight former Western Athletic Conference (WAC) members seeking stability amid WAC realignment. Early tensions over divisional alignment led to the MW’s creation, with later expansions including TCU (2005), Boise State (2011), and others. The 2010–12 realignment saw Utah, BYU, and TCU depart, while Fresno State, Nevada, and Hawai‘i joined. Subsequent years brought further flux: attempted mergers with C-USA, near-departures like San Diego State’s 2023 Pac-12 flirtation, and 2024 announcements that Boise State, Fresno State, Colorado State, San Diego State, and Utah State will leave for the Pac-12 in 2026. Counterbalancing exits, the MW added UTEP, Grand Canyon, UC Davis, Hawai‘i (full), Northern Illinois (football), North Dakota State (football), and new Olympic sports affiliates for 2026–27.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nrealignment, expansion, Pac-12, football, membership",

Early standouts like Kenny Easley and Steve Largent built the franchise’s legacy, while later stars such as Russell Wilson and Bobby Wagner anchored the 2013 Super Bowl-winning squad. The team’s visual identity has repeatedly transformed—from royal-blue/silver originals to the 2012 Nike redesign featuring “College Navy,” “Action Green,” and “Wolf Grey,” all highlighting the 12th-Man feather motif. After trading Wilson in 2022, the Seahawks quickly rebounded under new head coach Mike Macdonald, posting a franchise-best 14-3 record in 2025 and capturing Super Bowl LX.  \n\n**Keywords:** Seahawks uniforms, Pro Football Hall of Fame, 12th Man, Russell Wilson trade, Super Bowl LX",
