With Beast, he has released singles and albums in both Korean and Japanese. Beast won the Artist of the Year (Daesang) award at the Melon Music Awards in 2011. Hyunseung was also one half of the duo Trouble Maker with former Cube label mate, Hyuna . In December 2011, the duo released their debut extended play with the lead single, \" Trouble Maker .\" In October 2013, the duo released their second extended play, Chemistry where the title track \"Now\" is the first highest score ever recorded on music show Inkigayo , maxing out at 11,000 points. Career Pre-debut In 2004, at the age of 15, Hyunseung took part in auditions for YG Entertainment . He was eliminated in the second round, but went to see CEO Yang Hyun-suk afterwards out of frustration at being eliminated and was accepted as a trainee. For a year and four months, Hyunseung trained to debut as part of the boy group Big Bang . During this time, he used the stage name \"So-1,\" a homonym for the Korean word for wish. He first gained media attention when he appeared in the group's pre-debut \"Big Bang Documentary\", along with members G-Dragon , T.O.P , Taeyang , Daesung and Seungri . He appeared in 10 out of 11 episodes, but was cut from the group in a final elimination round against Seungri. Yang Hyun-suk said that Hyunseung's expressiveness and stage presence were underdeveloped at the time. Fellow Beast member, Yoon Doo-joon decided to become a singer after watching the Big Bang documentary featuring Hyunseung. Hyunseung refers to his experiences at YG as important to his development as an artist. Hyunseung later met future fellow band member Yang Yo-seob while they were working as dancers for a show performance team.

The result is an album's worth of the most tuneful pop you're likely to find on any continent.\" The album's lead single, \"Shining Star\" (April 2001), peaked at No. 21 on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart. 2004–2017: Free Kicks , Even & In Another Time Their fourth studio album, Free Kicks , was released on 6 June 2004 on their own label, El Reno Records. They had recorded some of the tracks in the United Kingdom in 2002.

Ned Raggett of AllMusic reviewed their self-titled, fifth studio album which showed they \"love their Beatles, their ELO, their power pop, their hints of roots music appreciation. It's all in there and they're not only not hiding it; they revel in it.\" Even was issued in 2007, which the group co-produced with Wayne Connolly (You Am I). In June 2008 Even's debut album Less Is More was voted number 30 of the greatest Australian albums ever in a poll by The Age readers.
