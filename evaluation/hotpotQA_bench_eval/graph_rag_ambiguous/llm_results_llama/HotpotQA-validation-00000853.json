      "text": "Juan Carlos Onetti Borges (July 1, 1909 – May 30, 1994) was a Uruguayan novelist and author of short stories . Early life Onetti was born in Montevideo , Uruguay. He was the son of Carlos Onetti, a customs official, and Honoria Borges, who belonged to a Brazilian aristocratic family from the state of Rio Grande do Sul . He had two siblings: an older brother Raul, and a younger sister Rachel. The original surname of his family was O'Nety (of Irish or Scottish origin). The writer himself commented: \"the first to come here, my great-great-grandfather, was English , born in Gibraltar . My grandfather was the one who italianized the name\". Career A high school drop-out, Onetti's first novel, El pozo , published in 1939, met with his close friends' immediate acclaim, as well as from some writers and journalists of his time. 500 copies of the book were printed, most of them left to rot at the only bookstore that sold it, Barreiro (the book was not reprinted until the 1960s, with an introduction and preliminary study by Ángel Rama ). Aged 30, Onetti was already working as editing secretary of the famous weekly Uruguayan newspaper Marcha . He had lived for some years in Buenos Aires , where he published short stories and wrote cinema critiques for the local media, and met and befriended novelist and journalist Roberto Arlt , author of the novels El juguete rabioso , Los siete locos , Los lanzallamas . He went on to become one of Latin America 's most distinguished writers, earning Uruguay National Literature Prize in 1962. He was considered a senior member of the ' Generation of 45 ', a Uruguayan intellectual and literary movement: Carlos Maggi , Manuel Flores Mora , Ángel Rama , Emir Rodríguez Monegal , Idea Vilariño , Carlos Real de Azúa , Mauricio Muller , José Pedro Díaz , Amanda Berenguer , Mario Benedetti , Ida Vitale , Líber Falco , among others. In 1974, he and some of his colleagues were imprisoned by the military dictatorship. Their crime: as members of the jury, they had chosen Nelson Marra's short story El guardaespaldas (i.e. \"The bodyguard\") as the winner of Marcha' s annual literary contest. Due to a series of misunderstandings (and the need to fill some space in the following day's edition), El guardaespaldas was published in Marcha , although it had been widely agreed among them that they shouldn't do so due to its sensitive political themes.

Many of her works fall into the genre of magic realism and contain elements of magic , irony , and non-standard romances and relationships. Early life and education Alice Hoffman was born in New York City and raised on Long Island , New York . Her grandmother was a Russian-Jewish immigrant. She graduated from Valley Stream North High School in 1969, and then from Adelphi University with a Bachelor of Arts .

      "text": "Arthur Bryce Courtenay , AM (14 August 1933 – 22 November 2012) was a South African-Australian advertising director and novelist. He is one of Australia's best-selling authors, notable for his book The Power of One . Background and early years Arthur Bryce Courtenay was born in the Lebombo Mountains in what was then the Union of South Africa , the son of Maude Greer and Arthur Ryder. Ryder was married with six children, and lived with his family, but also maintained a relationship with Greer, with whom he already had a daughter, Rosemary. Maude Greer gave the surname Courtenay to both her children. Bryce Courtenay spent most of his early years in a small village in the Lebombo Mountains in the Northern Transvaal province (present-day Limpopo ). He later attended King Edward VII School, Johannesburg . In 1955, while studying journalism in London, Courtenay met Benita Solomon. They emigrated to Sydney in 1958, married in 1959 and had three sons – Brett, Adam and Damon. Courtenay entered the advertising industry and, over a career spanning 34 years, was the Creative Director of McCann Erickson , J. Walter Thompson and George Patterson Advertising . His award-winning campaigns included the original Milkybar Kid commercial. Along with Geoff Pike , Courtenay developed the concept behind the Cadbury Yowie , a chocolate that contained a children's toy, typically an Australian or New Zealand native animal. On 1 April 1991, Courtenay's son Damon (who was born with the blood condition haemophilia ) died at age 24 from AIDS-related complications , contracted through a blood transfusion. Courtenay divorced Benita in 2000 and acknowledged sexual relationships with other women during their 42-year marriage. Benita Courtenay died on 11 March 2007, at the age of 72, four months after being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia . He later lived in Canberra with his second wife, Christine Gee. Writing Courtenay's novels are primarily set in South Africa, the country of his birth, or Australia, his adopted country. His first book, The Power of One , was published in 1989 and, despite Courtenay's fears that it would never sell, quickly became one of Australia's best-selling books by any living author. The story was made into a film , as well as being re-released in an edition for children. Courtenay was one of Australia's most commercially successful authors. He built up this success over the long term by promoting himself and developing a relationship with readers as much as marketing his books; for instance, he gave away up to 2,500 books free each year to readers he met in the street. However, only The Power of One has been published in the United States. Courtenay claimed that this was because",

      "text": "Othonna is a genus of approximately 90 species of succulent or subsucculent perennial herbs or shrubs, with its center of diversity in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of South Africa but some species' ranges include southern Namibia , Angola , and Zimbabwe . The genus was established by Linnaeus in 1753 containing 14 species, however, of those original species, only four are still retained in Othonna , while the others have been transferred to different genera including Cineraria , Euryops , Hertia , Ligularia , Senecio , and Tephroseris . The genus Othonnna is known to be monophyletic. In 2012, a new genus Crassothonna B. Nord. was erected with 13 species transferred from Othonna . A complete modern taxonomic treatment of the genus is being undertaken by the Compton Herbarium and the South African National Biodiversity Institute . The first part, a revision of the Othonnna bulbosa group (those species that are geophytic with an aerial stem), was published in 2019. The name Othonna is derived from the Ancient Greek ὄθοννα and the Latin othone, which is a linen cloth or napkin, in allusion to the downy covering of some of the earlier known species. Several species in the Othonna and Crassothonna are commonly called bobbejaankool in Afrikaans which translates to baboon cress or baboon cabbages.

      "text": "Anne Perry (born Juliet Marion Hulme ; 28 October 1938 – 10 April 2023) was a British writer and convicted murderer. She was the author of the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt and William Monk series of historical detective fiction . In 1994, it became public knowledge that Perry had been convicted of murder in Christchurch , New Zealand in 1954 when she was fifteen. She and her sixteen-year-old friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker's mother, Honorah . After serving a five-year sentence for the murder, Perry changed her name from Juliet Hulme and returned to the United Kingdom. She was identified by the media following the release of the film Heavenly Creatures , directed by Peter Jackson , which is based on the case. Early life Juliet Marion Hulme was born on 28 October 1938 in London, the second child and first daughter of physicist Henry Rainsford Hulme . Hulme was diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child and sent to the Caribbean , South Africa, and New Zealand in hopes that a warmer climate would improve her health. She rejoined her family after her father took a position as rector of Canterbury University College in New Zealand. She attended Christchurch Girls' High School , located in what became the Cranmer Centre . A 1948 Auckland Star photograph of Hulme arriving in New Zealand was discovered by Auckland Libraries staff in 2012 and written about in the Heritage et AL blog. Murder and trial In June 1954, at the age of 15, Hulme and her best friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker's mother, Honorah Rieper. Hulme's parents were in the process of separating and she was supposed to go to South Africa to stay with a relative. The two teenage friends, who had created a complicated fantasy life together populated with celebrities such as Mario Lanza and James Mason , did not want to be separated. On 22 June 1954, the girls and Rieper went for a walk in Victoria Park in the Port Hills of Christchurch . On an isolated path, Hulme dropped an ornamental stone so that Rieper would lean over to retrieve it. Parker had planned to hit her mother with half a brick wrapped in a stocking. The girls presumed that one blow would kill her but it took more than 20. Parker and Hulme stood trial in Christchurch in 1954 and were found guilty on 28 August. As they were too young to be considered for the death penalty under New Zealand law at the time, they were convicted and sentenced to be \"detained at Her Majesty's pleasure \". They were released separately five years later. At the time of Perry's death in 2023, Parker and Perry were not believed to have had any contact since the trial. The events formed the basis for the 1994 film Heavenly Creatures , in which Melanie Lynskey portrayed a teenaged Pauline Parker and",

She is the daughter of Robert Gorham Davis, a critic and professor of English, and Hope Hale Davis , a short-story writer, teacher, and memoirist. Davis initially \"studied music—first piano, then violin—which was her first love.\" On becoming a writer, Davis has said, \"I was probably always headed to being a writer, even though that wasn't my first love. I guess I must have always wanted to write in some part of me or I wouldn't have done it.\" From fifth to eighth grade, she attended The Brearley School in New York City. She attended high school at The Putney School , graduating in 1965. She studied at Barnard College , and at that time she mostly wrote poetry. In 1974, Davis married Paul Auster , with whom she had a son named Daniel (1977–2022). Auster and Davis later divorced; Davis is now married to the artist Alan Cote, with whom she has another son, Theo Cote. She is a professor emerita at the University at Albany, SUNY , and was a Lillian Vernon Distinguished Writer-in-Residence at New York University in 2012. Career Davis has published six collections of fiction, including The Thirteenth Woman and Other Stories (1976) and Break It Down (1986), a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award . Her most recent collections were Varieties of Disturbance , a finalist for the National Book Award published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2007, and Can't and Won't (2013).

L. Snijders . She has written one novel, The End of the Story , which was published in 1995 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux . Reception and influence Davis has been described as \"the master of a literary form largely of her own invention.\" Some of her \"stories\" are only one or two sentences.
