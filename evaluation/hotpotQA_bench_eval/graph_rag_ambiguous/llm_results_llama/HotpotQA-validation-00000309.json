      "text": "Sunset Strip is a 2012 documentary directed by Hans Fjellestad and produced by Tommy Alastra. The documentary explores the history of the mile and a half long stretch of road through West Hollywood known as Sunset Strip . It premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival . Synopsis Film portal United States portal The film begins with a poem recited by Mark Mahoney, and utilizes several celebrities to discuss the history of the Sunset Strip. The Sunset Strip was born during the Roaring Twenties as a dirt road connecting Hollywood's big studios to the new development known as Beverly Hills . The so-called strip was just outside of the city, and LAPD's jurisdiction, which provided the ideal environment for speakeasies, brothels, and crime of every level, but also led to much creativity. Using the stars who worked and found success there, this film explores the stories that make up the history of the Sunset Strip. Much of the time spent is on the 1950-1970s era, but the film touches upon major events such as the Golden Age of Hollywood at Ciro's and the Trocadero , The Doors playing at the Whiskey-A-Go-Go and The Roxy , legends about Mickey Cohen , and the multiple influential rock artists who called that part of the city home. Production Tommy Alastra Productions began shooting in 2010. The film features so-called \"guerilla footage\" (amateur shots, often from the crowd's perspective) of the Strip's club and rock and roll shows, and interviews shot in different locations. Conversation-style interviews about memories are used, as opposed to the traditional \"talking at the camera\" format of documentaries. As a result, the film eschews the more structured format of shaping its ideas. Many of the interviews feature more than one actor or musician, and Tommy Alastra Productions compiled footage under multiple sources. It was a challenge to remove background noise, create smooth sound quality and ensure archival footage was presented clearly as a result. Celebrity appearances Various musicians, movie celebrities, and personalities are asked about their experiences in and around the Sunset Strip, and their recollection of important moments (such as the shutdown of Tower Records).

He lamented the decline of campus film societies: \"There was once a time when young people made it their business to catch up on the best works by the best directors, but the death of film societies and repertory theaters put an end to that, and for today's younger filmgoers, these are not well-known names: Buñuel , Fellini , Bergman , Ford , Kurosawa , Ray , Renoir , Lean , Bresson , Wilder , Welles . Most people still know who Hitchcock was, I guess.\" Ebert argued for the aesthetic values of black-and-white photography and against colorization, writing: Black-and-white movies present the deliberate absence of color. This makes them less realistic than color films (for the real world is in color). They are more dreamlike, more pure, composed of shapes and forms and movements and light and shadow. Color films can simply be illuminated. Black-and-white films have to be lighted ... Black and white is a legitimate and beautiful artistic choice in motion pictures, creating feelings and effects that cannot be obtained any other way. He wrote: \"Black-and-white (or, more accurately, silver-and-white) creates a mysterious dream state, a simpler world of form and gesture. Most people do not agree with me. They like color and think a black-and-white film is missing something. Try this. If you have wedding photographs of your parents and grandparents, chances are your parents are in color and your grandparents are in black and white. Put the two photographs side by side and consider them honestly. Your grandparents look timeless. Your parents look goofy. The next time you buy film for your camera, buy a roll of black-and-white. Go outside at dusk, when the daylight is diffused. Stand on the side of the house away from the sunset. Shoot some natural-light closeups of a friend. Have the pictures printed big, at least 5 x 7. Ask yourself if this friend, who has always looked ordinary in every color photograph you've ever taken, does not suddenly, in black and white, somehow take on an aura of mystery. The same thing happens in the movies.\" Ebert championed animation, particularly the films of Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata . In his review of Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke , he wrote: \"I go to the movies for many reasons. Here is one of them. I want to see wondrous sights not available in the real world, in stories where myth and dreams are set free to play. Animation opens that possibility, because it is freed from gravity and the chains of the possible. Realistic films show the physical world; animation shows its essence. Animated films are not copies of 'real movies,' are not shadows of reality, but create a new existence in their own right.\" He concluded his review of Ratatouille by writing: \"Every",

      "text": "I pitied and loved him. And when I saw the movie right after Mastroianni died, I thought that Fellini and Marcello had taken a moment of discovery and made it immortal. There may be no such thing as the sweet life. But it is necessary to find that out for yourself. Preferences Favorites In an essay looking back at his first 25 years as a film critic, Ebert wrote: If I had to make a generalization, I would say that many of my favorite movies are about Good People ... Casablanca is about people who do the right thing. The Third Man is about people who do the right thing and can never speak to one another as a result ... Not all good movies are about Good People. I also like movies about bad people who have a sense of humor. Orson Welles , who does not play either of the good people in The Third Man , has such a winning way, such witty dialogue, that for a scene or two we almost forgive him his crimes. Henry Hill, the hero of Goodfellas , is not a good fella, but he has the ability to be honest with us about why he enjoyed being bad. He is not a hypocrite. Of the other movies I love, some are simply about the joy of physical movement. When Gene Kelly splashes through Singin' in the Rain , when Judy Garland follows the yellow brick road, when Fred Astaire dances on the ceiling, when John Wayne puts the reins in his teeth and gallops across the mountain meadow, there is a purity and joy that cannot be resisted. In Equinox Flower , a Japanese film by the old master Yasujirō Ozu , there is this sequence of shots: A room with a red teapot in the foreground. Another view of the room. The mother folding clothes. A shot down a corridor with a mother crossing it at an angle, and then a daughter crossing at the back. A reverse shot in the hallway as the arriving father is greeted by the mother and daughter. A shot as the father leaves the frame, then the mother, then the daughter. A shot as the mother and father enter the room, as in the background the daughter picks up the red pot and leaves the frame. This sequence of timed movement and cutting is as perfect as any music ever written, any dance, any poem. Ebert credits film historian Donald Richie and the Hawaii International Film Festival for introducing him to Asian cinema through Richie's invitation to join him on the jury of the festival in 1983, which quickly became a favorite of his and would frequently attend along with Richie, lending their support to validate the festival's status as a \"festival of record\".

      "text": "Raymond Clevie Carver Jr. (May 25, 1938 – August 2, 1988) was an American short story writer and poet . He published his first collection of stories, Will You Please Be Quiet, Please? , in 1976. His breakout collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love (1981), received immediate acclaim and established Carver as an important figure in the literary world. It was followed by Cathedral (1983), which Carver considered his watershed and is widely regarded as his masterpiece. The definitive collection of his stories, Where I'm Calling From , was published shortly before his death in 1988. In their 1989 nomination of Carver for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction , the jury concluded, \"The revival in recent years of the short story is attributable in great measure to Carver's mastery of the form.\" Early life Carver was born in Clatskanie, Oregon , a mill town on the Columbia River , and grew up in Yakima, Washington , the son of Ella Beatrice Carter (née Casey) and Clevie Raymond Carver. His father, a sawmill worker from Arkansas , was a fisherman and a heavy drinker. Carver's mother worked on and off as a waitress and a retail clerk. His brother, James Franklin Carver, was born in 1943. Carver was educated at local schools in Yakima. In his spare time, he read mostly novels by Mickey Spillane or publications such as Sports Afield and Outdoor Life , and hunted and fished with friends and family. After graduating from Yakima High School in 1956, Carver worked with his father at a sawmill in California. In June 1957, at age 19, he married 16-year-old Maryann Burk, who had just graduated from a private Episcopal school for girls. Their daughter, Christine La Rae, was born in December 1957. Their second child, a boy named Vance Lindsay, was born a year later. Carver worked as a delivery man, janitor, library assistant, and sawmill laborer, while Maryann worked as an administrative assistant, high school English teacher, salesperson, and waitress. Writing career Carver moved to Paradise, California , with his family in 1958 to be close to his mother-in-law. He became interested in writing while attending Chico State College and enrolled in a creative writing course taught by the novelist John Gardner , then a recent doctoral graduate of the Iowa Writers' Workshop , who became a mentor and had a major influence on Carver's life and career. In 1961, Carver's first published story, \"The Furious Seasons\", appeared. More florid than his later work, the story strongly bore the influence of William Faulkner . \"Furious Seasons\" was later used as a title for a collection of stories published by Capra Press, and",

Do the Right Thing doesn't ask its audiences to choose sides; it is scrupulously fair to both sides, in a story where it is our society itself that is not fair.\" Contrarian reviews Metacritic later noted that Ebert tended to give more lenient ratings than most critics. His average film rating was 71%, if translated into a percentage, compared to 59% for the site as a whole. Of his reviews, 75% were positive and 75% of his ratings were better than his colleagues. Ebert had acknowledged in 2008 that he gave higher ratings on average than other critics, though he said this was in part because he considered a rating of 3 out of 4 stars to be the general threshold for a film to get a \"thumbs up.\" Writing in Hazlitt about Ebert's reviews, Will Sloan argued that \"[t]here were inevitably movies where he veered from consensus, but he was not provocative or idiosyncratic by nature.\" Examples of Ebert dissenting from other critics include his negative reviews of such celebrated films as Blue Velvet (\"marred by sophomoric satire and cheap shots\"), A Clockwork Orange (\"a paranoid right-wing fantasy masquerading as an Orwellian warning\"), and The Usual Suspects (\"To the degree that I do understand, I don't care\"). He gave only two out of four stars to the widely acclaimed Brazil , calling it \"very hard to follow\" and is the only critic on RottenTomatoes to not like it. He gave a one-star review to the critically acclaimed Abbas Kiarostami film Taste of Cherry , which won the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival . Ebert later added the film to a list of his most-hated movies of all time. He was dismissive of the 1988 Bruce Willis action film Die Hard , stating that \"inappropriate and wrongheaded interruptions reveal the fragile nature of the plot\". His positive 3 out of 4 stars review of 1997's Speed 2: Cruise Control , \"Movies like this embrace goofiness with an almost sensual pleasure\" is one of only three positive reviews accounting for that film's 4% approval rating on the reviewer aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , one of the two others having been written by his At the Movies co-star Gene Siskel. Ebert reflected on his Speed 2 review in 2013, and wrote that it was \"Frequently cited as an example of what a lousy critic I am,\" but defended his opinion, and noted, \"I'm grateful to movies that show me what I haven't seen before, and Speed 2 had a cruise ship plowing right up the main street of a Caribbean village.\" In 1999, Ebert held a contest for University of Colorado Boulder students to create short films with a Speed 3 theme about",

The song’s sparse, bass-driven post-disco/funk blend and lyrics about a paternity claim were inspired by groupies’ real-life accusations toward Jackson and his brothers. Its groundbreaking music video broke MTV’s racial barrier, while Jackson’s Emmy-nominated Motown 25 performance debuted the moonwalk and iconic fedora-and-sequined-jacket look, cementing his pop-icon status. Critically acclaimed, “Billie Jean” has garnered Grammy and American Music Awards, Diamond RIAA certification, and high rankings on Rolling Stone’s and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame’s all-time song lists.  \n\n**Keywords**:  \nBillie Jean, Michael Jackson, Thriller, moonwalk, music-video milestone",

Stage and music keep her alive too: Maggie Cronin’s one-woman show “A Most Notorious Woman” tours since 1989, while the sea-shanty “Óró ’Sé Do Bheatha ’Bhaile” celebrates her in folk tradition. Public memory is anchored in place and ritual: statues stand at Westport House, outside Chicago’s Old St Pat’s, and on Newport’s Medlicott Street; Howth’s Grace O’Malley Park marks her legendary 1576 castle visit; three Irish Lights tenders have carried the name Granuaile since 1948; and Tampa’s Ye Loyal Krewe of Grace O’Malley parades her colors at the Gasparilla Pirate Festival.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nGrace O’Malley, pirate queen, Irish folklore, Granuaile, cultural icon",
