      "text": "Tom Clancy's The Division is a 2016 online-only action role-playing video game developed by Massive Entertainment and published by Ubisoft . It was released on 8 March for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , and Xbox One . It is set in a near future New York City in the aftermath of a viral pandemic ; the player, a Special Agent of the Strategic Homeland Division, is tasked with helping the group rebuild its operations in Manhattan , investigate the nature of the outbreak, and combat criminal activity in its wake. The Division is structured with elements of role-playing games , as well as cooperative and player versus player online multiplayer. This game also marked the debut of Massive and Ubisoft's Snowdrop game engine. Tom Clancy's The Division received generally positive reviews from critics. A sequel was released in March 2019. Gameplay An in-game screenshot of a player firing from cover Tom Clancy's The Division is an action role-playing game set in an open world mid-crisis Manhattan with destructible environments that can be freely explored by the players. The player's mission is to restore order by investigating the source of a virus. The player character can carry three weapons, and explosives like sticky bombs and seeker mines to fight against enemies. Players may take cover behind objects during fire-fights to avoid taking damage from enemies, and to give them a tactical advantage when attacking. The game is played from a third-person perspective . As players progress, they earn experience points (known as XP) and currency. They can use this currency to buy weapons and gear, and use the points to learn new talents and skills. The player's gear is categorized into seven levels: worn, standard, specialized, superior, high-end, gear set items or the rarer exotic items, each with a specific color code. Gear can be either bought, or found as in-game loot, or crafted from gathered materials. The storyline missions involve objectives that are relevant to their respective wing of the Base of Operations, which serves as the player's home base. At the player's home base there are three wings: Medical, Security, and Tech. Playing missions for a wing grants the player points for that wing which the player can spend to gain access to new talents, perks and facilities in the Base of Operations. The player will receive intel videos from each head of the wing at certain progression points, which the player can watch. The intel received is specific to its wing, with the Medical wing giving virus reports on the outbreak, the Security wing giving insight into each in-game enemy faction and the Tech wing providing camera footage. The game features a dynamic, time-based weather system which may bring benefits or disadvantages to players. For instance, storms can hinder player's visibility and make aiming difficult. The game also features a day-night cycle which can change the behaviour of enemies in the game. The Dark Zone is the player-versus-player competitive multiplayer mode featured in The Division , where a lot of high-end weapons are left behind when the",

This allowed players to collect the named enemies' superior and high-end loot over and over again. The most popular target of this exploit was a character known as the Bullet King, as this character was the named enemy closest to any player spawn point in the game. The glitch has been resolved in patch 1.0.2 of the game, released by Ubisoft on 22 March 2016. An exotic weapon (the highest quality weapon), an LMG whose ability allows its user to never reload while firing, was named after the character in The Division 2 . During the 20th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards , the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated Tom Clancy's The Division for \" Role-Playing/Massively Multiplayer Game of the Year \" and \" Outstanding Achievement in Online Gameplay \". Sales According to Ubisoft, the game broke company records, including highest number of first-day sales (breaking the record previously set by Watch Dogs in 2014), and becoming the company's best-selling game. The Division also broke the industry record for biggest first-week launch for a new game franchise, generating an estimated amount of $330 million globally. The retail version of The Division was the best selling game in its week of release in the U.K. and Ireland, debuting at No. 1 in the UK retail software sales chart. The game's launch marked the biggest video game debut in the first quarter of the year in the U.K., breaking the record previously held by Sony's Gran Turismo 4 . It was the third biggest launch of a Ubisoft game in the U.K., behind Assassin's Creed III and Watch Dogs . The game has the highest week one sales for a new intellectual property , breaking the record held by Destiny . The game was No. 1 in Japan, selling over 80,000 units in its first week. The NPD Group indicated that the retail version of The Division was the best selling game in March 2016 in the U.S. The game sold more than 10 million copies during the eighth generation of video game consoles . Film adaptation In June 2016, it was announced that a live action feature film adaption of The Division is in development. Jake Gyllenhaal was cast to star in the lead role, and to co-produce the film with CEO of Ubisoft Motion Pictures, Gerard Guillemot. By August, Jessica Chastain was cast in the co-starring role of the film. In January 2017, Stephen Gaghan was attached to direct, though he left the project in 2018.

      "text": "Snowdrop (also known as Ubisoft Snowdrop ) is a proprietary game engine created by Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft for use on Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X/S , Nintendo Switch , Nintendo Switch 2 , Stadia , and Luna . It was revealed at E3 2013 with Tom Clancy's The Division , the first game using the engine. Snowdrop is one of the primary game engines used by Ubisoft along with Disrupt , Dunia , and Ubisoft Anvil . History The engine is coded mainly in C++ . Rodrigo Cortes, former brand art director at Massive Entertainment , said that development on the Snowdrop engine started in 2009. Initially it was an engine built for PC and next-gen development to \"do things better not bigger\". The core of the game engine is powered by a \"node-based system\" and the engine is a dynamic, interconnected and flexible system where developers can create their assets quickly and interact with them in ways that have never been done before. Massive created a lighting and destruction system inspired by film production techniques. Features of Snowdrop include advanced physically based rendering (PBR), procedural destruction, and a dynamic global illumination system. According to the developers, the engine was designed with three pillars: Empowerment, which allows animators, artists and designers to get their work done quicker, Real Time, which allows developers to implement and iterate quickly and Fun, a concept that applies not only to the final product, but to using the engine during development. An improved version of the engine was used for Tom Clancy's The Division 2 . In February 2016, Massive confirmed that the engine can be used for other Ubisoft games. According to Martin Hultberg, head of IP at Ubisoft Massive, Snowdrop became available to all Ubisoft studios and not just those working on the Tom Clancy's IP. These games include South Park: The Fractured but Whole , Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle , and Starlink: Battle for Atlas . In June 2021, Ubisoft confirmed that the engine will be upgraded for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora . According to senior technical artist Kunal Luthra, thousands of assets can be propagated inside of each frame to create more highly detailed environments. The engine would also support real-time ray tracing, unified volumetric rendering, as well as improved AI behavior for NPCs . Snowdrop was used for Star Wars Outlaws , which features RTX Direct Illumination and DLSS Ray Reconstruction. Massive developed its own digital \"camera lens\" in Snowdrop, which was used to give the game a more cinematic presentation as an option. The remake of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell will also use Snowdrop. Ubisoft announced they will continue to upscale and develop the engine.

A planned third novel in the series, Swordsmen of Pellucidar , remained unfinished. His other pastiches also met with mixed success. While Mordred , his Buck Rogers novel, saw print, his Conan novel, while contracted and paid for by Tor Books , was ultimately rejected. Another novel, Danton Doring , a collaboration with Burroughs' son John Coleman Burroughs , whom he helped treat for Parkinson's disease, was never completed. Holmes was a regular guest at Burroughs fan conventions such as the Edgar Rice Burroughs Chain of Friendship (ECOF).

The financial success of Mike Carr, writer of the previous module included in the boxed set, showed that \"a module like this [...] could bring significant income to its author\". In early 1980, Carr's module was replaced by Gygax's in the Basic Set . Reception Anders Swenson reviewed The Keep on the Borderlands for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"It is well balanced, and suitable for the levels of characters for which it was written. D&D is a good introductory set of adventure gaming rules, and The Keep on the Borderland is a good introduction to D&D .\" Kirby T. Griffis, reviewing the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 37, found the module \"interesting and full of excitement\", though he considered the map sloppily done. He concluded by stating \"on the whole, I enjoyed this module and recommend it.\" Lawrence Schick , in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds , described the adventure as \"A good start for new players\" and speculated that at the time, \"There probably have been more copies of B2 printed than of any other role-playing scenario.\" A retrospective review in Shadis #29 (1996) said that \" Keep on the Borderlands was designed with beginners in mind, and may seem quaint to experienced role-players. But that quaintness grows on you as you read through it, and the mix and match quality of the dungeon leaves an impression that's hard to ignore. For a Basic D&D nostalgia trip, there's very little that can match it.\" To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game, Erik Mona and James Jacobs chose their Top Thirty Greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventures of all time, and ranked The Keep on the Borderlands in 7th place. Ken Denmead of Wired listed the module as one of the \"Top 10 D&D Modules I Found in Storage This Weekend\". According to Denmead, the module \"should give a party of low-levels a rather challenging time.\" Writing for Black Gate in 2014, Scott Taylor listed the cover art of Keep on the Borderlands by Jim Roslof as #8 in The Top 10 TSR Cover Paintings of All Time. Jon Peterson commented that Keep on the Borderlands is \"a classic, beloved module, whose Caves of Chaos owe no particular debt to Carr's Caverns of Quasqueton, though much of Carr's enlightening text about the art of dungeon mastering was effectively paraphrased in Gygax's version. [...] Because Keep on the Borderlands would ship with the Moldvay Basic Set , at the height of the D&D boom in 1981, it became one of the most widely known modules in D&D history, selling 750,000 copies a year.
