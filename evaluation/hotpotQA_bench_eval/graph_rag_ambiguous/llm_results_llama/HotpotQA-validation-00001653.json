      "text": "St. John's College (abbreviated as SJC , and locally known as St. John's or John's ) is a private Catholic selective secondary school for boys and private co-educational university college , located in Belize City , Belize . Founded in 1887 by the Society of Jesus as St. John Berchmans' College, a high school for boys only, it has since grown and now offers a wide variety of liberal arts and science courses at the secondary, British A-level , and United States junior college levels. For management purposes, St. John's is organised into three divisions: St. John's College High School, Belize (oldest, established 1887) St. John's College Junior College (established 1964) St. John's College University (established 2023) Key centres and institutes within the university college are the School of Music, School of Nursing, the Belizean Studies Research Centre, and the MAGIS Center, History St. John's College was founded in 1887 with the establishment of the “Select School” for young men at the Catholic presbytery , Holy Redeemer Cathedral in Belize City. The founder of St. John's College was Fr. Cassian Gillett, S.J., one of four British Jesuit priests, who arrived in Belize in the 1880s. The school opened with 12 day-students and two boarders. According to the 1897 prospectus, the school's mission was “to afford the youth of the Colony, and the neighboring Republics, the means of obtaining a solid mental and moral training.” It added that Belize needed “a school of Higher Studies so that our youth would not have to go abroad for preparation for university work.” The school grew quickly. In February 1896, it moved into a newly constructed building on the cathedral grounds . Its name changed from the Select School to St. John's College, under Fr. William J. Wallace. The enrollment continued to expand and included boarding students from neighboring Central American republics such as Guatemala and Honduras . This steady expansion forced a second move, to seafront land supplied by the government to the south of town. On July 17, 1917, the faculty and students moved into spacious wooden buildings with wide verandahs and windows open to the sea breeze. The campus was called Loyola Park. More construction followed including a gymnasium and chapel. By 1929 there were 90 students at the college. August 1921 saw an outbreak of yellow fever at Loyola Park. Day students returned to their homes for hospitalization. Boarding students were first taken to a small island just off the coast, Moho Caye. From there boarders from the rural areas of Belize, Yucatán , and Guatemala returned home but those from Honduras were refused admittance in their country. They were quarantined at Sargent's Caye.

      "text": "– Philosophia et septem artes liberales (Philosophy and seven liberal arts) – was produced by an Alsatian nun and abbess Herrad of Landsberg with her community of women as part of the Hortus deliciarum . Their encyclopedia compiled ideas drawn from philosophy, theology, literature, music, arts, and sciences and was intended as a teaching tool for women of the abbey. The image Philosophy and seven liberal arts represents the circle of philosophy, and is presented as a rosette of a cathedral: a central circle and a series of semicircles arranged all around. It shows learning and knowledge organised into seven relations, the Septem Artes Liberales or Seven Liberal Arts. Each of these arts find their source in the Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally \"love of wisdom\". St. Albert the Great, a doctor of the Catholic Church, asserted that the seven liberal arts were referred to in Sacred Scripture, saying: \"It is written, 'Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven pillars' (Proverbs 9:1). This house is the Blessed Virgin; the seven pillars are the seven liberal arts.\" Page, with illustration of Music, from Marriage of Mercury and Philology In the Renaissance , the Italian humanists and their Northern counterparts, despite in many respects continuing the traditions of the Middle Ages, reversed that process. Re-christening the old trivium with a new and more ambitious name: Studia humanitatis , and also increasing its scope, they downplayed logic as opposed to the traditional Latin grammar and rhetoric, and added to them history, Greek, and moral philosophy (ethics), with a new emphasis on poetry as well. The educational curriculum of humanism spread throughout Europe during the sixteenth century and became the educational foundation for the schooling of European elites, the functionaries of political administration, the clergy of the various legally recognized churches, and the learned professions of law and medicine. The ideal of a liberal arts, or humanistic education grounded in classical languages and literature , persisted in Europe until the middle of the twentieth century; in the United States, it had come under increasingly successful attack in the late 19th century by academics interested in reshaping American higher education around the natural and social sciences. Similarly, Wilhelm von Humboldt 's educational model in Prussia (now Germany), which later became the role model for higher education also in North America, went beyond vocational training. In a letter to the Prussian king, he wrote: There are undeniably certain kinds of knowledge that must be of a general nature and, more importantly, a certain cultivation of the mind and character that nobody can afford to be without. People obviously cannot be good craftworkers, merchants, soldiers or businessmen unless, regardless of their occupation, they are good, upstanding and – according to their condition – well-informed human beings and",

      "text": "Philosophia et septem artes liberales , \"philosophy and the seven liberal arts\". From the Hortus deliciarum of Herrad of Landsberg (12th century). Liberal arts education (from Latin liberalis ' free ' and ars ' art or principled practice ' ) is a traditional academic course in Western higher education, which traditionally covers the natural sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. Liberal arts takes the term art in the sense of a learned skill rather than specifically the fine arts . Liberal arts education can refer to studies in a liberal arts degree course or to a university education more generally. Such a course of study contrasts with those that are principally vocational , professional, or technical, as well as religiously based courses. The term liberal arts for an educational curriculum dates back to classical antiquity in the West, but has changed in meaning considerably, mostly expanding it. The seven subjects in the ancient and medieval meaning came to be divided into the trivium of rhetoric , grammar , and logic , and the quadrivium of astronomy , arithmetic , geometry , and music . However, there are hundreds of modern disciplines of study that now support modern professions and are traditionally recognised as liberal arts throughout academia. Some of the most popular liberal arts disciplines include: Anthropology , English , Literature , Fine arts , Foreign languages, Philosophy , Psychology , Sociology , Music , Journalism , Economics , Law , Communications , Architecture , Creative arts , Art , and History , and the Formal and Natural Sciences . Degrees in Liberal studies are often confused with those in a liberal arts discipline. Liberal studies refers to degrees with a broad curriculum, across multiple liberal arts disciplines and/or sciences and technologies. Apart from the sciences, enrollment in liberal arts degree programs has been declining in the 2010s and 2020s in the United States, in part because of a perception of worse job prospects. As of 2023, liberal arts degrees holders in the United States had a median wage of US$60,000, as opposed to $70,000 for all degree holders. As a result, liberal arts colleges and schools are popularly rebranding themselves as more vague and encompassing areas of study, such as arts and social sciences , arts and sciences and humanities . History Before they became known by their Latin variations ( artes liberales , septem artes liberales , studia liberalia ), the liberal arts were the continuation of Ancient Greek methods of inquiry that began with a \"desire for a universal understanding.\" Pythagoras argued that there was a mathematical (and geometric) harmony to the cosmos or the universe; his followers linked the four arts of astronomy , arithmetic , geometry , and music into one area of study to form the \"disciplines of the mediaeval quadrivium \". In the 4th-century-BC Athens, the government of the polis , or city-state, respected the ability of rhetoric or public speaking above almost everything",

      "text": "and diversification (1990s–present) Amid concern over declining humanities enrolments, a Chronicle of Higher Education survey in 1999 identified eleven new or revitalised great-books programmes at U.S. campuses, often launched with support from the National Association of Scholars. Many such curricula now incorporate works by women and non-Western authors, while advocates argue that juxtaposing, for example, Homer and Toni Morrison demonstrates the canon's adaptability to diverse classrooms. Interest among Muslim education institutions Today, many neo-traditional Muslim scholars such as Shaykh Hamza Yusuf and Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad (Tim Winter) have advocated for learning the Great Books of the Western World and the Liberal Arts tradition, noting that Muslims have long since been directly involved in promoting and advocating for the trivium and quadrivium. As such, students of Zaytuna College and Cambridge Muslim College generally have an appreciation for these sciences. Legacy Great-books seminars remain core requirements at Columbia, Chicago and St. John's, underpin discussion groups run by the Great Books Foundation, and inform executive-education offerings at the Aspen Institute. Supporters contend that shared inquiry into enduring questions fosters civic deliberation, whereas detractors view the canon as an exclusionary relic. The debate itself confirms the movement's enduring cultural resonance. In Europe Triumph of St. Thomas & Allegory of the Sciences by Andrea di Bonaluto. Frasco, 1365–68, Basilica di S. Maria Novella. In most parts of Europe, liberal arts education is deeply rooted. In Germany, Austria and countries influenced by their education system it is called ' humanistische Bildung' (humanistic education). The term is not to be confused with some modern educational concepts that use a similar wording. Educational institutions that see themselves in that tradition are often a Gymnasium (high school, grammar school). They aim at providing their pupils with comprehensive education ( Bildung ) to form personality with regard to a pupil's own humanity as well as their innate intellectual skills.  Going back to the long tradition of the liberal arts in Europe, education in the above sense was freed from scholastic thinking and re-shaped by the theorists of the Enlightenment ; in particular, Wilhelm von Humboldt . Since students are considered to have received a comprehensive liberal arts education at gymnasia , very often the role of liberal arts education in undergraduate programs at universities is reduced compared to the US educational system.  Students are expected to use their skills received at the gymnasium to further develop their personality in their own responsibility, e.g. in universities' music clubs, theatre groups, language clubs, etc. Universities encourage students to do so and offer respective opportunities but do not make such activities part of the university's curriculum.  Thus, on the level of higher education, despite the European origin of the liberal arts college, the term liberal arts college usually denotes liberal arts colleges in the United States .

      "text": "University of Northern Philippines entrance in Tamag, Vigan City The University of Northern Philippines ( UNP ; Filipino : Pamantasan ng Kahilagaang Pilipinas ) is a university in Barangay Tamag, in the City of Vigan in the province of Ilocos Sur , Philippines . It is the first and oldest state university in Northern Luzon which offers low tuition fee, tracing its roots to 1906, which is older than the University of the Philippines by two years. It is the only state university in the province aimed for less-fortunate people and one of three state-owned educational institutions of higher learning operating in Ilocos Sur (with the Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College and the Northern Luzon Polytechnic State College, a former branch of the university). History The university began as the Vigan High School (present-day Ilocos Sur National High School ) in 1906. Its shop department was converted into a separate intermediate level school, named the Vigan Trade School in 1910. It opened its high school in 1927 and produced its first graduates in 1931, when it evolved as the Ilocos Sur Trade School. President Manuel Luis Quezon converted the Ilocos Sur Trade School in 1941 through the help of Assemblyman Benito T. Soliven and Governor Pedro Singson Reyes, but was temporarily halted due to World War II. In 1951 the Ilocos Sur Trade School became the Northern Luzon School of Arts and Trades (NLSAT) by virtue of Republic Act 647. In 1960, by virtue of Republic Act 2700, or the General Appropriations Act of 1960, NLSAT was converted into the Ilocos Sur School of Arts and Trades (ISSAT). On June 19, 1965, then-Congressman Floro S. Crisologo authored Republic Act 4449 and was signed into law at the Philippine Embassy in Roppongi, Tokyo, Japan, converting ISSAT into the University of Northern Philippines . The university then began implementing its Charter on October 14, 1965, with Crisologo widely recognized as the founder of the university. The Candon Community College (CCC) was incorporated into the university in 1989 through Republic Act 6744, through the efforts of then-Congressman Eric D. Singson. It acted as a semi-autonomous unit. Despite this semi-autonomous status, the University of Northern Philippines – Candon Campus (formerly CCC) was split from the university by virtue of Republic Act 10085 (also authored by Singson) to become the Northern Luzon Polytechnic State College in 2010.

      "text": "St. John's College is named in honor of Fr. Rafael Landívar , S.J. (1731-1793) and features a bust of him in a very prominent area of the campus. Rafael Landívar was born in Guatemala October 27, 1731, entered the Jesuits in 1750, and taught philosophy and theology in Guatemala. Banished from the Spanish colonies, he retired to Italy and wrote a five-volume Latin poem, Rusticatio Mexicana, that has made him the national poet of Guatemala. He died and was buried in Bologna, but at the demand of students, his body was moved to Guatemala. Landivar made an etching of Bishop Payo Enriques de Rivera, the original of which is in the Jesuit residence in Madrid. It has appeared thirteen times on Guatemalan postage. Patron saint St. John Berchmans was born the eldest son of a shoemaker on 13 March 1599 in Diest at Brabant, which is located in Belgium. At a young age he wanted to be a priest, and at thirteen became a servant in the household of one of the cathedral canons at Malines. After his mother's death, his father and two brothers followed suit and entered religious life. In 1615, he entered the Jesuit college there, becoming a novice a year later. In 1618 he was sent to Rome for more studies, and was known for his cheerfulness and his effort to find perfection in all the little details of his life. His father was ordained that year, and died six months later. John was so poor and humble that he walked from Antwerp to Rome. He died at the age of 22 on August 13. Many miracles were attributed to him after his death. He was canonized in 1888, and is the patron saint of altar servers . He longed to work in the mission fields of China, but did not live long enough to go there. After completing his course work, he was asked to defend the entire field of philosophy in a public disputation in July, just after his exit examinations. The following month he was asked to represent the Roman College in a debate with the Greek College. \"John opened the discussion with great clarity and profoundness, but after returning to his own quarters, was seized with the Roman Fever ,\" a particularly virulent form of malaria, that led to his death at the age of 22. The large numbers who came to view his remains testified to his sanctity. He was buried in the Church of the Gesù in Rome, the mother church of the Society of Jesus in which the Society's founder Saint Ignatius of Loyola is also buried.

Early in 1952, in response to the growing need in Belize for higher levels of academic training, St. John's College expanded its traditional four-year high school program, offering a limited number of post-secondary school courses under the direction of Fr. Robert Raszkowski, S.J. This expanded into what in the British tradition is called Sixth Form , a two-year program leading to Advanced Level Examinations (\" A-Levels \") out of Cambridge University in England. In the mid-1960s, in an effort to provide wider opportunities for further education to graduates of the Sixth Form, St. John's College broadened the program of studies so that it met the requirements of the associate degree awarded by junior and community colleges in the United States . It received membership in the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges . This afforded St. John's College Sixth Form graduates a choice of further studies. They could enter Commonwealth universities, which require Cambridge “A Level” certificates, or United States universities as transfer students into the third year of a Bachelor's degree program. Over 200 graduates of Sixth Form have received scholarships from the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States to finish their bachelor's degree tuition-free. Many accepted the offer to remain as teaching fellows and so finished their master's degree. St John's College High School St. John's College High School is a private Catholic selective secondary school for boys, located in Belize City, Belize. The school was founded in 1887 by the Society of Jesus as St. John Berchmans' College. The school exists to educate academically talented young men in a Jesuit environment of self-discipline, love of learning, and service to others. The school 's curriculum is complemented by sports and extracurricular activities. The third and fourth form classes follow the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) curricula and sit the regionally administered examinations at the end of their fourth year. Characteristics The school is operated by the Jesuits as a preparatory high school for boys and is based on the British model of secondary education. The average class size is 32 boys and enrolment is 170 new boys per year.

Quinlan Terry is the single most distinguished and prolific architect at work in the Classical tradition in either Britain or the United States. He has attempted more completely than any other architect in Britain to pull the rug from beneath the false certainties of Modernism. – David Watkin (2006). Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry Conversely, Terry has been the subject of considerable criticism. A 2015 article in the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Journal quoted the late architectural historian Gavin Stamp , author of the Piloti column in the magazine Private Eye , in which Stamp derided Terry's work as \"stiff, pedantic and uninspiring, classical details stuck on to dull boxes\". The cultural critic Jonathan Meades , in a 2020 article in The Critic , repeated Stamp's strictures and dismissed Scruton's praise, \"[a man] who had no eye\", as \"embarrassingly silly\"; while Stephen Bayley is among those who have attacked the close relationship between Terry and the Prince of Wales. In a column in The Guardian in 2009, Bayley mocked the Prince's circle of architectural advisers as \"a coterie of fogeyish misfits, dreamers, forelock-tugging courtiers, DIY specialists, greasy pole-climbers [and] short-sighted antiquarians\", reserving particular scorn for Terry, \"a specialist in architectural pastiche [whose] modesty and art are in inverse proportion\". Honours In 2003 Terry won the Best Modern Classical House 2003, awarded by the British Georgian Group for Ferne House in Wiltshire . In 2005 Terry won the 3rd Annual Driehaus Prize , the most prestigious award for outstanding classical and traditional architects.

Framed by Senator Patrick Leahy’s introduction and three survivor essays, the story sends Bruce Wayne to war-torn Kravia after WayneCorp engineer Ted Orbley and a child are killed by mines; Batman rescues Ted’s daughter Sarah, only to see her die when she picks up an explosive disguised as a toy. The project parallels earlier Superman/Wonder Woman comics distributed in Central America and the Balkans, collectively using super-heroes to humanize the campaign for a worldwide mine ban.\n\n**Keywords**: land-mine awareness, Batman graphic novel, humanitarian comic, DC 1996, anti-mine campaign",

Politically anti-fascist, Bartók refused to perform in Nazi Germany and emigrated to the U.S. in 1940, where he completed his *Third Piano Concerto* and *Viola Concerto* before dying in 1945; his remains were repatriated to Budapest in 1988.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nBéla Bartók, Hungarian folk music, modernist composition, ethnomusicology, anti-fascist exile",
