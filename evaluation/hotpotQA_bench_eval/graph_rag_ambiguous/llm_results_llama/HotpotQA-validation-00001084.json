      "text": "Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games . It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series , following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV , and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas , based on Southern California , the single-player story follows three protagonists —retired bank robber Michael De Santa ( Ned Luke ), street gangster Franklin Clinton ( Shawn Fonteno ), and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips ( Steven Ogg )—and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. Players freely roam San Andreas's open world countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles . The game world is navigated on foot and by vehicle, from either a third-person or first-person perspective. Players control the protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A \"wanted\" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. In Grand Theft Auto Online , the game's online multiplayer mode, up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes. Shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide, the game's development began around the time of Grand Theft Auto IV 's release. The developers drew influence from many of their previous projects (such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 ) and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years. Grand Theft Auto V was released in September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 , in November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One , in April 2015 for Windows , and in March 2022 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S . Extensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion in its first three days. It received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple-protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay. However, its depiction of violence and women caused controversies. Several gaming publications awarded the game year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards. In retrospect, it is considered one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming 's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made . It is the second-best-selling video game of all time with 225 million copies shipped, and one of the most financially successful entertainment products of all time, with nearly $10 billion in worldwide revenue.

      "text": "story and characters—particularly Trevor—polarised reviewers. Some found the narrative inferior to previous Rockstar games and cited Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption 's plot strengths. Others thought the protagonists' contrasting personalities tightened the narrative's pacing. GamesRadar thought the game negated the story inconsistencies and muddled morality of previous series entries. Trevor was considered a particularly \"horrible, terrifying, psychotic human being—and a terrific character\" by GameSpot . Eurogamer found Trevor \"shallow and unconvincing\", and that his eccentricities hurt the narrative and overshadowed Michael and Franklin's character development. Joystiq faulted the protagonists' perceived lack of likability, as the conflict between Michael and Trevor grew into a \"seemingly endless cycle\". The Escapist had difficulty connecting with the characters' emotions since they acted out of greed with no sense of morality and thus gave players little reason to support them. Re-release Re-release reception Grand Theft Auto V 's re-release, similarly, received critical acclaim. It is the highest-rated PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game on Metacritic alongside Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2 , and the second-highest rated PC game alongside several others. Game Informer considered the addition of first-person \"another significant breakthrough for the series\" in the vein of Grand Theft Auto III 's shift to third-person from Grand Theft Auto 's bird's-eye view. GameSpot found that playing in first-person heightened the impact of Grand Theft Auto V 's violence, which made him reflect on morality and character motivation more than before. VideoGamer.com opined that players feel like inhabitants of the world, rather than \"guns attached to a floating camera\". The first-person view, in IGN ' s opinion, aided immersion and created a \"surprisingly different experience\". VideoGamer.com praised the \"finer details\" in first-person animations like camera lean when players take corners on motorcycles, or the navigational instruments in plane cockpits. Reviewers found playing the game more difficult in first-person, but Game Informer preferred the challenge. GameSpot thought the improved graphics and spatial anti-aliasing made the open world \"even more spectacular\". They said that in first-person \"everything looks bigger and more imposing\". IGN favoured the PlayStation 4 version's graphics over the Xbox One but thought both consoles rendered the game well and maintained mostly consistent frame rates. They praised the increased frame rate and graphics options offered in the PC version. VideoGamer.com called the console version's frame rate so consistent it was \"scarcely believable\", although GameSpot cited occasional frame rate dips. They opined that the PC version let players \"witness the full extent of Rockstar's admirable handiwork\", but noted that it \"retains evidence of its last-gen roots ... with simple geometry\". VideoGamer.com praised the Rockstar Editor's accessibility on PC but criticised some of its limitations and camera angle restrictions. IGN appreciated",

If an accomplice survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward and may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique skills. Some heists afford multiple strategies; in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn. Each character has a set of eight skills that represent their ability in specific areas such as shooting and driving. Though skills improve through play, each character has a skill with expertise by default (e.g. Trevor's flying skill). The eighth \"special\" skill determines proficiency in an ability that is unique to each respective character. Michael enters bullet time in combat, Franklin slows down time while driving, and Trevor deals twice as much damage to enemies while taking half as much in combat. A meter on each character's HUD depletes when an ability is being used and regenerates when players perform skilful actions (for example, drifting in vehicles as Franklin or performing headshots as Michael). While free-roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific activities such as scuba diving and BASE jumping , and visit businesses such as cinemas and strip clubs . Each character has a smartphone for contacting friends, starting activities and accessing an in-game Internet. The Internet lets players trade in stocks via a stock market . Players may purchase properties such as garages and businesses, upgrade the weapons and vehicles in each character's arsenal, and customise their appearance by purchasing outfits, haircuts and tattoos. Plot In 2004, criminals Michael Townley, Trevor Philips, and Brad Snider partake in a failed robbery in Ludendorff, North Yankton, resulting in Michael being presumed dead. Nine years later, Michael lives with his family in the city of Los Santos under the alias Michael De Santa, having made a secret agreement with Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Dave Norton to stay hidden. Across town, gangbanger Franklin Clinton works for a corrupt car salesman and meets Michael while attempting to fraudulently repossess his son's car. The two later become friends. When Michael finds his wife sleeping with her tennis coach, he and Franklin chase the coach to a mansion, which Michael damages in anger. The owner, drug lord Martin Madrazo, demands monetary compensation, so Michael returns to a life of crime to obtain the funds, enlisting Franklin as an accomplice. With the help of Michael's old friend Lester Crest, a disabled hacker, they rob a jewellery store to pay off the debt. Meanwhile, Trevor, who lives in squalor in rural Blaine County, hears of the heist and recognises Michael's work; Trevor had believed the FIB killed Michael in the Ludendorff heist. Trevor finds Michael and reunites with him, forcing the latter to reluctantly accept the former back into his life. As time goes on, the protagonists'",

Independent journalist Tom Chick defended the torture sequence, and wrote that unlike Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 ' s \" No Russian \" mission or the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty , the underlying political commentary on torture in \"By the Book\" necessitated the violent content. The torture gameplay was cut from the Japanese release. Several reviewers found the game's portrayal of women misogynistic ; VG247 wrote the female characters were \"either there to be rescued, shouted at, fucked, to be seen fucking, put up with, killed, heard prattling away like dullards on their mobile phones or shopping\". Edge noted the game treated its all-male lead characters in a similar vein through their stereotyped tendencies towards violence. After GameSpot ' s Carolyn Petit claimed the game was misogynistic, her review was met with backlash as users responded with 20,000 largely negative comments on the webpage and a Change.org petition for her firing. Many journalists defended her right to an opinion and lamented the gaming community's defensiveness towards criticism. Australian department stores Target and Kmart pulled the game from their stores in December 2014 after a Change.org petition against depictions of violence towards women in the game amassed over 40,000 signatures. Take-Two Interactive chief operating officer Strauss Zelnick publicly expressed the company's disappointment that the game had been pulled from the retailers, and affirmed that he \"stand[s] behind our products, the people who create them, and the consumers who play them\". IGN called the Change.org petition \"misinformed\", stating that its complaints about incentives for committing sexual violence in the game are untrue. Sexual violence in games is forbidden by the Australian Classification Board , meaning the game would have been refused classification. Kotaku said that the depiction of women is inherently problematic, and that Target were within their rights to refuse to stock the game and were obligated to respond to the petition's wide support. Petit (writing for Kotaku ) and online anti-harassment activist Ben Colliver criticised the game's depiction of transgender characters as sex workers with primarily muscular bodies, describing it as harmful transphobic stereotypes; Colliver wrote that the representation \"does not reflect the complex, nuanced structures that often regulate transgender people's lives\". The April 2022 re-release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S removed the content from all portions of the game except Director Mode, meaning their models are accessible but without dialogue options. Some journalists recognised the removal may have been prompted by an open letter written by LGBTQ+ advocacy group Out Making Games, who requested the removal after reading Petit's article. The group praised Rockstar's decision to remove the content. In October 2013, rapper Daz Dillinger issued a cease and desist letter to Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive for allegedly using two of his songs without authorisation. In February 2014,",

      "text": "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games . The game is the third entry in the Red Dead series and a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption . The story is set in a fictionalized representation of the United States in 1899 and follows the exploits of Arthur Morgan , an outlaw and member of the Van der Linde gang, who must face the challenges of a declining Wild West , while attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The game is presented through first- and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam its interactive open world . Gameplay elements include shootouts , robberies , hunting , horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters , and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player. The game's development lasted over eight years, beginning soon after Red Dead Redemption ' s release, and it became one of the most expensive video games ever made. Rockstar co-opted all of its studios into one large team to facilitate development. They drew influence from real locations as opposed to film or art, focused on creating an accurate reflection of the time with the game's characters and world. The game was Rockstar's first built specifically for eighth-generation consoles , having tested their technical capabilities while porting Grand Theft Auto V . The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by Woody Jackson and several vocal tracks produced by Daniel Lanois . Development included a crunch schedule of 100-hour weeks, leading to reports of mandatory and unpaid overtime . Red Dead Online , the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 32 players engage in a variety of cooperative and competitive game modes. Red Dead Redemption 2 was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2018, and for Windows and Stadia in November 2019. It broke several records and had the second-biggest launch in the history of entertainment, generating US$725 million in sales from its opening weekend and exceeding the lifetime sales of Red Dead Redemption in two weeks. The game received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its story, characters, open world, graphics, music, and level of detail, but some criticism at its control scheme and emphasis on realism over player freedom. It won more than 175 Game of the Year awards and received multiple other accolades from awards shows and gaming publications . It is considered one of eighth-generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the greatest video games ever made . It is the fourth-best-selling video game with over 82 million copies shipped. Gameplay The player may choose to respond positively or negatively to non-player characters throughout the game world, which affects their reputation within the game.

The game was the fourth best-selling game in the United Kingdom in 2010, as well as the fourth best-selling PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 title. The game sold over 95,000 units in its first week in Japan; the PlayStation 3 version was the fourth best-selling game of the week with over 70,000 sales, while the Xbox 360 version was seventh with over 25,000 sales. Legacy Critics concurred that Red Dead Redemption was among the best games of the seventh generation of video game consoles . Eurogamer ' s Dan Whitehead hoped the eighth generation of consoles would offer \"similarly powerful experiences\". In September 2013, IGN ranked Red Dead Redemption the fifth-best PlayStation 3 and seventh-best Xbox 360 game. In 2015, GamesRadar ranked it sixth on its list of best games, recognizing its superiority in narrative over Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V (2013), and USgamer ranked it tenth on its list of best 21st-century games; Jaz Rignall called it \"one of the finest open world games so far seen\". GamesRadar+ named it the fourth-best game of the decade in 2019, comparing it favorably to other sandbox games Grand Theft Auto V and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015). Red Dead Redemption ranked high on several best game lists determined by the public; it featured seventh on Good Game ' s \"Top 100 Games\" list, and fifth on IGN ' s \"Games of a Generation\" list, as voted by the program and website's respective audiences.

They called the game \"a triumph both for gamers and for the medium itself, and it deserves its runaway success\". In November 2013, Hardcore Gamer placed the game third on their \"Top 100 Games of the Generation\" list. They cited its improved shooting and driving mechanics over its predecessors, and considered the multiple protagonist design \"a welcome change of pace\" that could become an eighth-generation gaming benchmark. In December, The Daily Telegraph listed the game among their \"50 best games of the console generation\". They called it a \"cultural behemoth\" that \"will be Rockstar's lasting legacy\". In January 2014, Computer and Video Games ranked the game fourth on their \"Games of the Generation\" list. They said that for the first time, Rockstar created an \"utterly beautiful\" open world. They found that the game did away with Grand Theft Auto IV 's repetitive mission design and focused instead on fun gameplay. In May, IGN ranked it eighth on their \"Top 100 Games of a Generation\" list and called it a \"huge, raucous, and wildly ambitious bridge towards the [eighth] generation of console gaming\". The next month, it placed third on IGN ' s \"Games of a Generation: Your Top 100\" list as voted by the site's readers. In August, Game Informer ranked it third on their \"Top 10 Action Games Of The Generation\" list. They compared the game's quality to that of its predecessor but thought that its ensemble character set-up, varied missions and multiplayer superseded Grand Theft Auto IV 's placement on the list. They wrote of the story's absurd drama and the open world's vastness, and did not \"regret a single second\" spent playing the game. In November, Edge named it the fifth-best game of its generation and commented that \"no other game studio is even daring to attempt an open world game in its tradition because there is simply no possibility of measuring up to [its] standards.\" In 2015, the publication rated it the second-greatest video game of all time.

In October 2013, rapper Daz Dillinger issued a cease and desist letter to Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive for allegedly using two of his songs without authorisation. In February 2014, television personality Karen Gravano of the reality television programme Mob Wives filed suit against Rockstar Games in allegation that a character in the game is based on her likeness and story and was depicted without her consent. Rockstar filed to dismiss Gravano's lawsuit in April, and stated that the allegations are foreclosed by the First Amendment . In July, actress Lindsay Lohan filed a lawsuit, claiming elements in the game, including the Lacey Jonas character, were influenced by her image, voice and clothing line without permission. Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a dismissal of the case, saying that the case was frivolous and filed for publicity purposes. In 2016, both lawsuits were dismissed. Sales Within 24 hours of its release, Grand Theft Auto V generated more than US$815 million in worldwide revenue, equating to approximately 11.21 million copies sold for Take-Two Interactive.
