      "text": "Carnegie Mellon University ( CMU ) is a private research university in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania, United States. The institution was established in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie as the Carnegie Technical Schools . In 1912, it became the Carnegie Institute of Technology and began granting four-year degrees. In 1967, it became Carnegie Mellon University through its merger with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research , founded in 1913 by Andrew Mellon and Richard B. Mellon and formerly a part of the University of Pittsburgh . The university consists of seven colleges, including the College of Engineering , the School of Computer Science , the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences , and the Tepper School of Business . The university has its main campus located 5 miles (8.0 km) from downtown Pittsburgh . It also has over a dozen degree-granting locations on six continents, including campuses in Qatar , Silicon Valley , and Kigali, Rwanda ( Carnegie Mellon University Africa ) and partnerships with universities nationally and globally. In 2022, Carnegie Mellon enrolled 15,818 students across its multiple campuses from 117 countries and employed more than 1,400 faculty members. Carnegie Mellon is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". Carnegie Mellon competes in NCAA Division III athletics as a founding member of the University Athletic Association . Carnegie Mellon fields eight men's teams and nine women's teams as the Tartans. The university's faculty and alumni include 21 Nobel Prize laureates and 13 Turing Award winners and have received 142 Emmy Awards , 64 Tony Awards , and 13 Academy Awards . History Andrew Carnegie , founder of the Carnegie Technical Schools Andrew Mellon , co-founder of the Mellon Institute The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by the Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie , who wrote \"My heart is in the work\", when he donated the funds to create the institution. Carnegie's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers, many of whom worked in his mills. Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York , founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887. In 1912, the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) and began offering four-year degrees. During this time, CIT consisted of four constituent schools: the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the School of Apprentices and Journeymen, the School of Science and Technology, and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women . The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon (who went on to become U.S. Treasury Secretary ) and Richard B. Mellon in honor of their father, Thomas Mellon , patriarch of the Mellon family . The Institute began as a research organization that performed contract work for government and",

Rutgers a cappella groups have routinely placed well in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella , including in 2010 when The OrphanSporks placed second in the semifinals. Governed by the Rutgers University Student Assembly and funded by student fees, students can organize groups for practically any political ideology or issue, ethnic or religious affiliation, academic subject, activity or hobby. Rutgers University is home to chapters of many Greek organizations , and a significant percentage of the undergraduate student body is active in Greek life. Several fraternities and sororities maintain houses for their chapters in the area of Union Street (known familiarly as \"Frat Row\") in New Brunswick , within blocks of Rutgers' College Avenue Campus. Chapters of Zeta Psi and Delta Phi were organized at Rutgers as early as 1845. The Alpha Rho chapter of Chi Psi fraternity, founded at Rutgers College in 1879, was the first fraternity at Rutgers to own a fraternity house, purchased in 1887 and still in use by the fraternity today. There are over fifty fraternities and sororities on the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus, ranging from traditional to historically African-American , Hispanic , Multicultural , and Asian interest organizations. The New Brunswick campus of Rutgers University has a chapter of the only active co-ed pre-medical fraternity, Phi Delta Epsilon , as of 2008 [update] . The Rutgers chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi was closed in October 2025 after a student was left unconscious by a hazing ritual. It is Rutgers's tradition for students to participate in one of the largest student-run philanthropic events in New Jersey, the Embrace Kids Foundation for children with cancer and blood disorders. The annual Dance Marathon involves hundreds of dancers and volunteers. In 2015, the marathon collected $692,046. Rutgers has five vocal ensembles: Voorhees Choir (the New Brunswick campus's women's ensemble), Kirkpatrick Choir (the university's most selective coed ensemble), Glee Club (New Brunswick's most esteemed tenor-bass ensemble), University Choir (a larger mixed choir in New Brunswick), and the Rutgers Concert Choir (Camden's vocal ensemble of faculty and students). Traditions The Grease Trucks are a group of truck-based food vendors located at various locations on the New Brunswick campus. They serve traditional grill fare and Middle-Eastern specialties. Three Rutgers Grease Trucks remain on the College Avenue Campus, while the remaining two were moved to the Cook/Douglass Campus. The Dance Marathon is a student-run fundraisers. Hundreds of dancers pledge to raise funds and remain standing for 32 hours. Rutgers has held this tradition since 1999 and to date has raised more than $1.3 million for the Embrace Kids Foundation and for other charities. In the two decades starting in 1998,",

      "text": "Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey , commonly referred to as Rutgers University or simply Rutgers ( / ˈ r ʌ t ɡ ər z / RUT -gərz ), is a large public land-grant research university consisting of three campuses in New Jersey . Chartered in 1766, Rutgers was originally called Queen's College and was affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church . It is the eighth-oldest college in the United States, the second-oldest in New Jersey (after Princeton University ), and one of nine colonial colleges that were chartered before the American Revolution . In 1825, Queen's College was renamed Rutgers College in honor of Colonel Henry Rutgers , whose substantial gift to the school had stabilized its finances during a period of uncertainty. From its founding to the mid 20th century, Rutgers was a private liberal arts college . It has evolved into a major public research university since being designated the State University of New Jersey by the state's legislature in 1945 and 1956. Rutgers has several distinct campuses. Since colonial times, Rutgers' historic core has been located along College Avenue at the College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey as part of Rutgers University–New Brunswick , which includes the College Avenue Campus, as well as Douglass campus, Cook campus, both primarily in the city New Brunswick, and both the Busch and Livingston campuses on the north side of the Raritan River in Piscataway , as well as many buildings throughout downtown New Brunswick. Two other major campuses are located at Rutgers University–Newark , and Rutgers University–Camden . The university has additional facilities located throughout the state, including oceanographic research facilities at the Jersey Shore . Rutgers is a land-grant , sea-grant , and space-grant university, as well as the largest university in the state . Instruction is offered by 9,000 faculty members in 175 academic departments to over 45,000 undergraduate students and more than 20,000 graduate and professional students. As of Fall 2023, Rutgers University enrolls over 69,000 students across its three campuses, making it one of the largest universities in the United States. The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and is a member of the Association of American Universities and the Universities Research Association . History 18th century Two decades after the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University , was established in 1746 by the New Light Presbyterians, ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church , seeking autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs in the Thirteen Colonies , sought to establish a college to train those who wanted to become ministers within the Dutch Reformed Church in the colony. This religious organization developed into the Reformed Church in America .

On May 15, President Barack Obama became the first sitting president to speak at the university's commencement. The university held a variety of celebrations, academic programs, and commemorative events which culminated on the 250th anniversary date, November 10, 2016. In November 2016, Rutgers released research findings that revealed: \"an untold history of some of the institution's founders as slave owners and the displacement of the Native Americans who once occupied land that was later transferred to the college.\" In January 2020, Jonathan Holloway made history as the first African American and person of color to be named president of Rutgers. On April 9, 2023, three unions voted to go on the first strike by academics in the university's 257-year history. Classes and research were suspended for a week. Five months later, in September, the university's faculty senate voted \" no confidence \" in Holloway; in addition to issues related to the strikes, the motion also cited Halloway's decision to dismiss the chancellor of the university's Newark campus and his proposal to merge the university's two medical schools. Organization and administration University president Since 1785, twenty-two men have served as the institution's president, beginning with Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh , a Dutch Reformed minister who was responsible for establishing the college. Before 1930, most of the university's presidents were clergy affiliated with Christian denominations in the Reformed tradition . Two presidents were alumni of Rutgers College— William H. S. Demarest (Class of 1883) and Philip Milledoler Brett (Class of 1892). The president serves in an ex officio capacity as a presiding officer within the university's 59-member board of trustees and its eleven-member board of governors, and is appointed by these boards to oversee the day-to-day operations of the university across its campuses. He is charged with implementing \"board policies with the help and advice of senior administrators and other members of the university community.\" The president is responsible only to those two governing boards—there is no oversight by state officials. The current president is William F. Tate IV , who assumed the role on July 1, 2025. He succeeded the 21st president Jonathan Holloway who assumed office on July 1, 2020. Governing boards Governance at Rutgers University rests with a board of trustees consisting of 41 members, and a board of governors consisting of 15 voting members: eight are appointed by the Governor of New Jersey and seven chosen by and from among the board of trustees. The trustees constitute chiefly an advisory body to the board of governors and are the fiduciary overseers of the property and assets of the university that existed before the institution became the State University of New",

Mellon in honor of their father, Thomas Mellon , patriarch of the Mellon family . The Institute began as a research organization that performed contract work for government and industry, initially as a department within the University of Pittsburgh . In 1927, the Mellon Institute was incorporated as an independent nonprofit. In 1937, the Mellon Institute's iconic building was completed on Fifth Avenue. In 1967, with support from Paul Mellon , the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University. In 1973, Carnegie Mellon's coordinate women's college , the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, merged its academic programs with the rest of the university. The industrial research mission of the Mellon Institute survived the merger as the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI) and continued doing work on contract to industry and government. In 2001, CMRI's programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities. During the 1970s and 1980s, the tenure of president Richard Cyert (1972–1990) witnessed a period of growth and development. The research budget grew from roughly $12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than $110 million in the late 1980s. Researchers in new fields like robotics and software engineering helped the university to build its reputation. One example was the introduction of the \" Andrew \" computing network in the mid-1980s. This project linking all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a technology leader in education and research. On April 24, 1985, cmu.edu , Carnegie Mellon's Internet domain, became one of the first six .edu domain names. In the 1990s and into the 2000s, Carnegie Mellon solidified its status among American universities, consistently ranking in the top 25 in the national U.S. News & World Report rankings, and in the top 30 (ranking 28th in 2022) amongst universities worldwide. Carnegie Mellon is distinct in its interdisciplinary approach to research and education. Through the establishment of programs and centers outside the limitations of departments or colleges, the university has established leadership in fields such as computational finance , information systems , cognitive sciences , management, arts management, product design, behavioral economics , energy science and economics, human–computer interaction , entertainment technology , and decision science . On April 15, 1997, Jared L. Cohon , former dean of the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies , was elected president by Carnegie Mellon's board of trustees. During Cohon's presidency, Carnegie Mellon continued its trajectory of innovation and growth.

The trustees constitute chiefly an advisory body to the board of governors and are the fiduciary overseers of the property and assets of the university that existed before the institution became the State University of New Jersey in 1945. The initial reluctance of the trustees (still acting as a private corporate body) to cede control of certain business affairs to the state government for direction and oversight caused the state to establish the Board of governors in 1956. Today, the board of governors maintains much of the corporate control of the university.

The schools are located in the Cooper's Grant and Central Waterfront neighborhoods of Camden. As of 2012 [update] , 4,708 undergraduates and 1,635 graduate students (total 6,343) are enrolled at the Camden campus. The campus was founded as the College of South Jersey and South Jersey Law School in the 1920s, and became part of Rutgers in 1950. Rutgers Health Rutgers Health (formerly Rutgers Biomedcial and Health Sciences) is a division of the university that serves as an umbrella organization for schools, centers, and institutes from Rutgers University and the old University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey . The organization was incorporated into the university following the 2013 merger of Rutgers and UMDNJ. While its various facilities are spread across several locations statewide, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences is considered a \"campus\" for certain organizational purposes, such as the appointment of a separate chancellor. In July 2023, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences renamed to Rutgers Health. Rutgers Health comprises nine schools and other research centers and institutes including; Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, New Jersey Medical School, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, School of Nursing , School of Dental Medicine, School of Health Related Professions, the School of Public Health, Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, Environmental and the Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Brain Health Institute, and the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging Research. The programs are offered at different location sites across New Jersey in New Brunswick, Newark, Blackwood , Stratford and Scotch Plains, New Jersey .

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of courses were conducted through remote instruction. Off-campus Rutgers offers classes at several off-campus sites in affiliation with community colleges and other state colleges throughout New Jersey. These partnerships are designed to enable students to achieve a seamless transfer to Rutgers and to take all of their Rutgers classes in a select number of the most popular majors at the community college campus. The collaborative effort provides access to Rutgers faculty teaching Rutgers courses, at a convenient location, but it is also one of the few programs that cater exclusively to the non-traditional student population.

Early trustees considered merging the college with the College of New Jersey, in Princeton , but the measure failed by one vote. They later considered relocating it to New York City . In 1808, after raising $12,000, the college temporarily reopened and broke ground on a building of its own, called \" Old Queens \", designed by architect John McComb Jr. The college's third president, Ira Condict , laid the cornerstone on April 27, 1809. Shortly after, the New Brunswick Theological Seminary , founded in 1784, relocated from Brooklyn , to New Brunswick, and shared facilities with Queen's College and the Queen's College Grammar School , and all three institutions were then overseen by the Reformed Church in America . During those formative years, all three institutions fit into Old Queens. In 1830, Queen's College Grammar School moved across the street, and in 1856, the seminary relocated to a seven-acre (28,000 m 2 ) tract less than one-half mile (800 m) away. Colonel Henry Rutgers (1745–1830), an early benefactor and the namesake of Rutgers University After several years of closure resulting from an economic depression after the War of 1812 , Queen's College reopened in 1825 and was renamed \"Rutgers College\" in honor of American Revolutionary War hero Henry Rutgers (1745–1830). According to the board of trustees, Colonel Rutgers was honored because he epitomized Christian ethics . A year after the school was renamed, it received two donations from its namesake: a $200 bell still hanging from the cupola of Old Queen's and a $5,000 bond (equivalent to $139,000 in 2024) which placed the college on sound financial footing. Rutgers College became the land-grant college of New Jersey in 1864 under the Morrill Act of 1862 , resulting in the establishment of the Rutgers Scientific School, featuring departments of agriculture , engineering , and chemistry . The Rutgers Scientific School would expand over the years to grow into the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station (1880) and divide into the College of Engineering (1914) and the College of Agriculture (1921). Rutgers created the New Jersey College for Women in 1918, and the School of Education in 1924. 20th century With the development of graduate education, and the continued expansion of the institution, the collection of schools became Rutgers University in 1924. Rutgers College continued as a liberal arts college within the university. Later, University College (1945) was founded to serve part-time, commuting students and Livingston College (1969) was created by the Rutgers Trustees, ensuring that the interests of ethnically diverse New Jersey students were met. Rutgers was designated the state university of New Jersey by acts of the New Jersey Legislature in 1945 and",

At this time, the liberal arts components of Cook College were absorbed into the School of Arts and Sciences as well, while the other aspects of that college remained, but as the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. These changes in 2007 ended the 241-year history of Rutgers College as a distinct institution. Students at the 2011 Rutgers tuition protests fought against rising education costs and diminished state subsidies. Campus groups (including the Rutgers Student Union, the Rutgers One Coalition, and the Rutgers University Student Assembly (RUSA), supported by New Jersey United Students (NJUS), mobilized to keep the increase in annual student financial obligation to a minimum through marches, sit-ins, letters to administration officials and forums. In 2011, there was an attempt by then New Jersey governor Chris Christie and members of the legislature to merge Rutgers–Camden into Rowan University , it ultimately was rejected in part due to several on-campus protests and pushback from Camden faculty, students, and alumni. On June 20, 2012, the outgoing president of Rutgers University, Richard L. McCormick , announced that Rutgers will \"integrate five acres along George Street between Seminary Place and Bishop Place into the College Avenue Campus.\" Most of the block had been occupied by the New Brunswick Theological Seminary . Rutgers agreed to rebuild the seminary in exchange for the land. In 2013, most of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey was integrated with Rutgers University and, along with several existing Rutgers units, was reformed as Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences . This merger attached the New Jersey Medical School and Robert Wood Johnson Medical School to Rutgers University. The Rutgers Shield was released on its 250th year anniversary in 2015.
