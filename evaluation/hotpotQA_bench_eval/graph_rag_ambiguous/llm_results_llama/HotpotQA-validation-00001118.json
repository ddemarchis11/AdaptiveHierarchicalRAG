The Lost Classics Project Alongside the theatre's new writing output, the long-running Lost Classics Project focuses on the production of obscure, underperformed or unperformed plays from previous generations. In the modern history strand this has included the first uncensored productions of two of John Osborne 's supposedly lost early plays ( Personal Enemy and The Devil Inside Him ), J.P. Donleavy’s The Ginger Man , together with a successful revival of Sylvia Rayman's long-unperformed all-female play Women of Twilight . The project's historical strand has been praised by academics for featuring \"an extensive range of non-Shakespearean plays\" and for seeking to \"extend the repertory beyond the select group of frequently revived plays\". Alongside the Read Not Dead project at Shakespeare's Globe and the Royal Shakespeare Company 's Jacobethan seasons, the Lost Classics Project is considered one of the three most influential attempts to \"reshape the twenty-first-century 'early modern repertory'\", with past productions including the first modern performances of Westward Ho by Thomas Dekker and John Webster , and Ben Jonson 's final play, The Magnetic Lady .

It was the fifth public playhouse to be built in London, after the Red Lion in Whitechapel (1567), The Theatre (1576) and the Curtain (1577), both in Shoreditch, and the theatre at Newington Butts ( c. 1580? ) – and the first of several playhouses to be situated in Bankside , Southwark , in a liberty outside the jurisdiction of the City of London 's civic authorities. Two of the earliest plays by William Shakespeare – Titus Andronicus and Henry VI, Part 1 – are recorded as having been performed there, as well as plays by dramatists such as Christopher Marlowe , Thomas Kyd , Robert Greene , George Peele , Thomas Dekker , Michael Drayton , Ben Jonson and Thomas Heywood . The Rose's archaeological remains were rediscovered in 1989 during the redevelopment of the site to build an office block, and were partially excavated. After a public campaign to preserve the remains, they are now listed by Historic England as a Scheduled Monument at Risk. Subsequently the site has become an exhibition space and theatre venue, known as The Rose Playhouse, administered by The Rose Theatre Trust, a registered charity, which plans to first complete the excavation and preservation of the remains, and then to build a new visitor, education and arts centre there. History 1593 map showing The Rose (labelled The play howſe ) in relation to the Beargarden (labelled The Bear howſe ) on Bankside London street map: The Rose is at bottom centre The Rose was built in 1587 by Philip Henslowe and by a tanner from Bletchingley named John Cholmley. The theatre was built on a messuage called the \"Little Rose,\" which Henslowe had leased from the parish of St. Saviour, Southwark in 1585. The Rose was the first of several theatres to be situated in Bankside , Southwark near the south shore of the River Thames. The area was known for its leisure attractions such as bear/bull-baitings, gaming dens and brothels. It was located in the Liberty of the Clink , a liberty outside the jurisdiction of the City of London 's civic authorities. The Rose contained substantial rose gardens and two buildings; Cholmley used one as a storehouse, while Henslowe appears to have leased the other as a brothel . North of London, professional playhouses like the Curtain Theatre and The Theatre had already been open for over a decade. However, Henslowe recognized the ease at which audiences could ferry across the River of Thames and established a playhouse in this particular location.

Combining Hoyle’s earlier theoretical insights, the Burbidges’ stellar-abundance data, and Fowler’s nuclear-reaction experiments, the 104-page review demonstrated that elemental abundances evolve over cosmological time and that dying stars enrich the interstellar medium, enabling younger, metal-rich stars to form.
