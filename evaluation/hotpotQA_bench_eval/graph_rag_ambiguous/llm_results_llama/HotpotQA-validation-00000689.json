      "text": "World Pictures ' home video branch. Director James Makichuk stated in a 2008 interview that he was trying to facilitate a DVD release via Netflix with a quality print of the film. In April 2012, Ghostkeeper was released for the first time on DVD through Code Red Releasing . The DVD includes a commentary with James Makichuck, Riva Spier and Murray Ord, an interview with director of photography John Holbrook as well as an interview with actress Georgie Collins. The film is presented in 1.78.1 anamorphic widescreen for the first time on video and has been restored from the only known existing film elements. On August 18, 2017, Code Red issued a Blu-ray edition of the film featuring a new 2K scan of the original film elements. In January 2026, Canadian International Pictures released a pre-order via the Vinegar Syndrome online store for a new Blu-ray release of the film. This release features a new 4K scan from the only known surviving theatrical print of the film, with newly-commissioned cast and crew interviews, audio commentaries, as well as archival features from prior releases. Reception Rosemary McCracken of the Calgary Herald commented on the film's screenplay, noting that it carries \"distinct echoes of Stanley Kubrick 's The Shining ,\" adding that \"despite the flaws in the script, the film has a fair bit going for it. The performances are a notch above those being offered in much of the American horror fare being served up in our theaters.\" John Brooker of the Staines Informer was unimpressed by the film, noting a \"plodding pace which will satisfy only undemanding horror fans.\" Of contemporary reviews, the horror film website The Terror Trap gave the film a positive review stating, \"Not for all tastes, the methodically paced Ghostkeeper is an exercise in disciplined mood generation; its bare claustrophobia either works for the viewer or not. But for those who prefer their chills straightforward, pre-sneer and pre-sarcasm, Keeper can be a most rewarding snow trap\". J. A. Kerswell from Hysteria Lives! gave the film a negative review calling the film \"flawed\", and \"muddled\". In The Blockbuster Entertainment Guide to Movies and Videos (1999), the film was rated two-and-a-half stars out of five, deemed \"an absurd thriller.\" Eric Cotenas of DVD Drive-In noted the film's prominent atmosphere and drew comparisons to Stephen King 's The Shining as well as cinematographer John Holbrook's \"aesthetic response to the desolate location.\" See also Folklore of the United States Wendigo Notes References Sources Blockbuster (1998).

      "text": "Ghostkeeper is a 1981 Canadian supernatural slasher film directed by James Makichuk , and starring Riva Spier, Georgie Collins , and Murray Ord. Its plot centers on a trio of snowmobilers in the Canadian Rockies who become stranded at an abandoned hotel where the elderly female innkeeper is hiding an evil entity within the building. The film is inspired by the Windigo legend of North America. Filmed in Banff, Alberta under a tax shelter in December 1980, the film had an unstable financial situation and the filmmakers nearly halted the production mid-way through due to depletion of its budget. The film was given a brief theatrical release in Canada and was released directly to video in the United States by New World Pictures . It has attained a cult following in the years since its release. The independent cult label Code Red Releasing later acquired the film, and released on DVD for the first time in April 2012. In August 2017, they reissued the film on Blu-ray featuring a new 2K scan of the original film elements. Plot Jenny, Marty, and Chrissy are spending their New Year's Eve on a snowmobiling trip in the Rocky Mountains . After talking with a storekeeper at a ski shop, the three decide to go riding before dark, but end up caught in a blizzard. Looming before them is a seemingly abandoned hotel at the top of the snow trail, isolated from tourists and miles away from the skiing area. The three enter the building to escape the increasingly harsh conditions, and find that the heat is on, but there are no lights. As night falls, they start a fire and tell stories and reminisce. Marty decides to go into the hotel kitchen where he finds an old woman lurking. She is brash and apprehensive of their presence, and they learn that she lives in the hotel with two unseen sons. Though hesitant, the woman lodges them in rooms. Marty and Jenny argue in their bedroom, while Chrissy goes down the hallway to take a bath since the plumbing in the rooms is obsolete. While in the bathtub, Chrissy is attacked by one of the sons, Danny, and held underwater. A restless Jenny goes to check on Chrissy, but the candle-lit bathroom is empty; Jenny then runs into the old woman and they have a conversation about the hotel and her sons. Meanwhile, Danny carries Chrissy to the basement of the hotel, where he slits her throat and then stores her body in a freezer. Jenny awakens in the night and hears the old woman talking to someone downstairs. Riva Spier as Jenny in the film's climactic sequence The next morning, Marty goes outside to the snowmobiles to activate them, with no success. Suspecting that they have been tampered with, he goes outside to an old shed for tools, while Jenny stays in the kitchen with the old woman, who is carving up cooked meat.

      "text": "the hill. In 1883, a local historian recorded the old name for Winter Hill as Edgar Hill, named in connection to Saxon King Edgar Burial mounds Two burial mounds dating from the Bronze Age are located near the peak. On 24 March 1957, two men discovered \"curved lines of stones\" sticking out of the peat forming a two feet high wall which surrounded a raised area in the middle. In July 1958, a group from the University of Manchester excavated the central mound only to find it had been excavated 250 years earlier. The site was thought to have originated from 1500 BC in the Middle Bronze Age. The second mound was found to the west on the southern edge of Noon Hill . The site was excavated in August 1958 by the Bolton & District Archaeological Society, revealing two lines of stones and human remains. Both are scheduled monuments . Two Lads There is a large cairn on the summit of Two Lads on Crooked Edge Hill on the south west side of Winter Hill. In the late 1700s there were apparently two close together. Another cairn was built in the late 20th century by a local man. It is smaller, some 40 metres from the large cairn. The remains of what appears to have been a third cairn is between the two that exist. It is doubtful however that it was ever a cairn as such. There is no photographic record of one. It is more likely a store of stones to be used to repair the main cairn. The site was originally known as 'Wilder Lads', originally united by a circular mound. The cairns height had been increased by a landowner, noted by local historian Thomas Hampson in 1883, at the time the cairns were thought to be Saxon. Hampson described the original Two Lads as the graves of two children of a Saxon king, Edgar , and recorded that Winter Hill was previously known as Edgar Hill. A legend exists that the cairns mark the site on which two boys lost their way on the moor and died of exposure in a snowstorm. In 1953/54 John Winstanley, Archaeologist had recorded Roman finds near this site, he concluded the site was once a Roman encampment. Flint chippings were found indicating much earlier use of this site. Scotsman's Stump Scotsman's Stump On 9 November 1838 George Henderson, a Scottish merchant walking over the hill from Horwich to Blackburn , was murdered by gunshot. A monument was erected in 1912 to replace an earlier bush planted at the spot, sited at the side of the road opposite the television station. Scotsman's Stump was celebrated in a poem entitled 'Scotchman's Stump' by Bolton poet John Cassidy. It was published in his collection Night Cries",

      "text": "Maurice Level (29 August 1875 – 15 April 1926) was a French writer of fiction and drama who specialized in short stories of the macabre which were printed regularly in the columns of Paris newspapers and sometimes staged by le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol , the repertory company in Paris's Pigalle district devoted to melodramatic productions which emphasized blood and gore. Many of Level's stories have been translated into American newspapers since 1903, notably his well-known tale \"The Debt-Collector\" (at least eight different translations). Between 1917 and 1919 the literary editor of the New York Tribune , William L. McPherson (1865-1930), translated seventeen war tales (three of them anonymously), seven of them being collected in Tales of Wartime France (1918). In 1920, English journalist, editor and publisher Alys Eyre Macklin (ca. 1875-1929) arranged a treaty with Level to be his official literary agent for all English-language countries ., and translated a selection of 26 tales as Crises, Tales of Mystery and Horror (1920). Nine of them have been first published by Hearst's Magazine in New York in 1919-1920. Some other tales appeared later in various newspapers or magazines in England or in the USA, such as Pan (London), or in the well-known pulp magazine Weird Tales . H. P. Lovecraft observed of Level's fiction in his essay Supernatural Horror in Literature (1927): \"This type, however, is less a part of the weird tradition than a class peculiar to itself — the so-called conte cruel , in which the wrenching of the emotions is accomplished through dramatic tantalizations, frustrations and gruesome physical horrors\". Critic Philippe Gontier wrote: \"We can only admire, now almost one hundred years later, the great artistry with which Maurice Level fabricated his plots, with what care he fashioned all the details of their unfolding and how with a master's hand he managed the building of suspense\". Thanks to Lovecraft, Maurice Level has been recognized in the United States and also in Japan as a minor master of the horrible, when he was forgotten in his own country, France during the major part of the 20th century. He was still in print in both these countries in the years 2000. Since 2017, various new editions of his works have been reissued in France, with new critical material.

Air disasters There have been over two dozen aircraft crashes on and around Winter Hill; the earliest being a single-seat fighter of the Royal Flying Corps and include a two-seater aircraft in the 1920s. During World War II an American Fairchild UC-61 Forwarder (41-54885) of 5th Air Depot Group crashed on 7 August 1942. On 12 November 1943 a Wellington bomber crashed below Rivington Pike; all six crew members died. They are commemorated in a memorial at the site. On 24 December 1943, an Airspeed Oxford (BM837) of 410 Squadron crashed on the hill. Other crashes have included several Spitfires , Hurricanes and a Gloster Meteor which crashed in 1953. The worst occurred on 27 February 1958; known as the Winter Hill air disaster , a Silver City Bristol 170 Freighter (G-AICS) travelling from the Isle of Man to Manchester crashed into Winter Hill several hundred yards away from the transmitter. 35 passengers and crew were killed in the accident. There is a memorial plaque to the accident at the site. In September 1965 a RAF De Havilland Chipmunk flew into the hill in cloud, without serious injury to the crew. The last crash occurred in October 1968 when a Cessna 172 force-landed between Winter Hill and Rivington Pike . 2018 wildfire In 2018, a large wildfire broke out on the 28 June. It burned over 7 square miles (18 km 2 ) of moorland, with one hundred firefighters sent to tackle the blaze. In total, the fire burned for 41 days, and caused a major incident to be declared. A man was later arrested for arson on suspicion of causing the wildfire. The fire, along with the Saddleworth Moor fire (which also burned over 7 square miles of land) has been described by local councillor Brenda Warrington as the \"worst series of moor fires in living memory\". It has affected local wildlife, killing both flora and fauna in an \"internationally important ecosystem\" as described by the Woodland Trust . The fire destroyed over a fifth of the moorland on the hill, and it may take a decade to recover fully. Concerns were raised in 2011 to Natural England regarding moorland management with warnings of increased fire risk due to policy of United Utilities to reduce grazing, whilst not using other land management measures including cutting or controlled burning to reduce fire risks.
