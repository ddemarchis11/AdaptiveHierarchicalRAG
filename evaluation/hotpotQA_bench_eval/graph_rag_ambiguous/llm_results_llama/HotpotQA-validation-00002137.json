      "text": "Fallow deer is the common name for species of deer in the genus Dama of subfamily Cervinae . The two living species are the European fallow deer ( Dama dama ), native to Europe and Anatolia , and the Persian fallow deer ( Dama mesopotamica ), native to the Middle East . The European species has been widely introduced elsewhere. Name The name fallow is derived from the deer's pale brown colour . The Latin word dāma or damma , used for roe deer , gazelles , and antelopes , lies at the root of the modern scientific name, as well as the German Damhirsch , French daim , Dutch damhert , and Italian daino . In Serbo-Croatian , the name for the fallow deer is jelen lopatar (\"shovel deer\"), due to the form of its antlers. The Modern Hebrew name of the fallow deer is yachmur ( יחמור ). Description The Persian fallow deer is the larger of the two living species, with an average body mass around 70–140 kg (150–310 lb), and a shoulder height around 80–110 cm (31–43 in) with the European fallow deer having an average body mass around 35–80 kg (77–176 lb). The living fallow deer species have antlers that have flattened (palmate) ends, with the palmate section being somewhat narrower in the antlers of Persian fallow deer. During the summer, European fallow deer have a reddish pelt with white spots along the back and the sides (flank), while during the winter, they have a grey pelt that lacks or has less visible spots. Ecology The diet of the European fallow deer has been described as highly flexible, able to adapt to local conditions. In Britain, it has been observed to primarily feed on grass in summer and acorns and other mast during the autumn and early winter, as well as on shrubs and trees. Taxonomy and evolution The genus includes two extant species: Extant species Some taxonomists classify the Persian fallow deer as a subspecies ( D. d. mesopotamica ), while others, such as the IUCN , treat it as a separate species ( D. mesopotamica ). Based on genetic evidence, Dama is considered to be closest living relative of the extinct genus Megaloceros . The circumscription of the genus is uncertain, with some authors choosing to include taxa that are otherwise placed in the genus Pseudodama , which may be ancestral to Dama . The earliest species of Dama appeared around the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary about 2.6 million years ago, or around the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene approximately 0.8 million years ago, depending on the species included in the genus.

The relationships of most Dama species to each other and to other fossil deer are controversial, with no overall consensus on their relationships, aside the close relationship of D. clactoniana with the living Dama species. The earliest Dama species lack palmate (broad and flattened) antlers, with this trait only developing in D. pelleponesica, D. clactoniana , and the two living species.

      "text": "Tatton Hall and the Italian Garden Tatton Park is a historic estate in Cheshire , England, north of the town of Knutsford . It contains a mansion, Tatton Hall ; a medieval manor house , Tatton Old Hall ; Tatton Park Gardens , a farm and a deer park of 2,000 acres (8.1 km 2 ). It is a popular visitor attraction and hosts over a hundred events annually. The estate is owned by the National Trust and is managed under lease by Cheshire East Council . Since 1999, it has hosted North West England 's annual Royal Horticultural Society flower show. History Village There is evidence of human habitation in the area of the estate going back to the Iron Age . The village of Tatton existed in medieval times. The settlement is now a Deserted medieval village but its buildings and roadways – which are now a scheduled monument – can still be seen as imprints within the estate's parkland. Old Hall By the end of the 15th century, the land on which the estate was created was owned by the Stanley family who built and occupied what became known as the Old Hall. By the 1580s this building had been enlarged and it was owned by the Brereton family. In 1598 the estate was bought by Sir Thomas Egerton , Lord Chancellor of England, from his half sister Dorothy Brereton. Sir Thomas and his children rarely visited the estate and it was rented to tenants. The hall was originally timber-framed , which was subsequently replaced by brick. It is L-shaped, in two storeys. The floors that had been inserted into the older wing have been removed, revealing the complex wooden roof. The Old Hall stands in grounds surrounded by a wall. Within these grounds is a reconstructed cruck barn. It is timber-framed with brick infill and has a thatched roof. Most of the timber has come from a demolished barn at Clotton Hoofield . The barn has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building . Tatton Hall At the end of the 17th century the estate was owned by John Egerton, Sir Thomas' grandson, who built a new house on the site of the present mansion, some 0.75 miles (1 km) to the west of the Old Hall. Work was completed around 1716. From 1758 improvements were made to the house and between the 1770s and 1816 most of it was replaced by the present neoclassical mansion, designed by Samuel Wyatt and his nephew Lewis William Wyatt . Further additions to the house were made in 1861–62 and in 1884. During the late 19th century large house parties were held in the hall, some of them attended by British and foreign royalty. The mansion contains much of the furniture made for its occupants by the family firm Gillows of Lancaster . There are over 150 provenanced or",

      "text": "Silene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae . Containing nearly 900 species, it is the largest genus in the family. Common names include campion and catchfly . Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Scientific history Members of this genus have been the subject of research by preeminent plant ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists, including Charles Darwin , Gregor Mendel , Carl Correns , Herbert G. Baker , and Janis Antonovics . Many Silene species continue to be widely used to study systems, particularly in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. The genus has been used as a model for understanding the genetics of sex determination for over a century. Silene species commonly contain a mixture of hermaphroditic and female (or male-sterile) individuals ( gynodioecy ), and early studies by Correns showed that male sterility could be maternally inherited, an example of what is now known as cytoplasmic male sterility . Two independent groups of species in Silene have evolved separate male and female sexes ( dioecy ) with chromosomal sex determination that is analogous to the system found in humans and other mammals. Silene flowers are frequently visited by flies, such as Rhingia campestris . Silene species have also been used to study speciation, host-pathogen interactions, biological species invasions, adaptation to heavy-metal-contaminated soils, metapopulation genetics, and organelle genome evolution. Notably, some members of the genus Silene hold the distinction of harboring the largest mitochondrial genomes ever identified. Taxonomy Silene was originally described by Linnaeus . Divisions of the genus into subgenera or sections before 2003 do not seem to be well-supported by molecular evidence. The genus Lychnis is closely related to (and sometimes included in) Silene . When treated as a distinct genus, it can often be differentiated by the number of flower styles (five in Lychnis' and three in Silene ), the number of teeth of the seed capsule (five in Lychnis' and six in Silene ), and by the sticky stems of Lychnis . Sexual systems Sexual systems vary across species. Most Silene species are hermaphroditic representing 58.2% of Silene species, 14.3% are dioecious , 13.3% gynodioecious , and 12.2% are both gynodioecious and gynomonoecious . Trioecy , andromonoecy , and gynomonoecy have also been reported but are extremely rare. Etymology Silene is the feminine form of Silenus , an Ancient Greek woodland deity who was a companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus . Species Ecology Lychnis is also the common name of",

This genus is characterized the by presence of three petals (along with the genera Stussenia and Lithobium ) as opposed to five in the other members of the family. Most members of the genus prefer growing in shady habitats. It is a large genus including about 175 species. This is primarily an Asiatic genus of the tropical and subtropical regions distributed from India and Sri Lanka to the Indo-Pacific . The members of the group are generally herbs or under shrubs, including some stemless members. Leaves opposite, leaf margin entire or serrulate. Inflorescence usually scorpioid cymes. Flowers in most species purple, some members with reddish or white flowers. Stamens 3, (in one whorl) or rarely 6 (in two whorls). Ovary inferior, 3-celled.

      "text": "site. The Duvanny Yar section exposes the yedoma ice complex or suite and is studied by many scientists as it represents a key strategic cross-section of Late Quaternary East Siberian stratigraphy and \"an important key section for the palaeo-environmental history of the Late Pleistocene Beringia Land, the non-glaciated landmass between the Taymyr Peninsula and Alaska.\" Near Duvanny Yar is the Pleistocene Park , ( Russian : Плейстоценовый парк ), a nature reserve on the Kolyma River south of Chersky where an attempt is being made to recreate the northern subarctic steppe grassland ecosystem that flourished in the area during the Last Glacial Period . Regeneration In February 2012, a team of scientists from the Institute of Cell Biophysics of the Russian Academy of Sciences announced they had successfully regenerated specimens from fruit that had been frozen for 31,800 (±300) years according to their radiocarbon dating. The accomplishment surpasses the previous record for the oldest plant material brought back to life, of 2000 years set by Judean date palm ( Phoenix dactylifera ) seeds. The team led by David Gilichinsky used material recovered in 2007 by Stakhov et al. Gilichinsky, who for many years was head of the Geocryology Lab in the Institute for Physicochemical and Biological Problems in Soil Science at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, died in February 2012, just before the paper was published. He was recognized by the team as a \"pioneer in studying microorganisms in Siberian and Antarctic permafrost, his achievement attracted scientists from all over the world to research on permafrost life systems.\" Initially, the researchers attempted to germinate mature seeds recovered from the fruit. When these attempts failed, they turned to the fruit itself and were able to culture adult plants from placental tissue . The team grew 36 specimens from the tissue. The plants looked identical to modern specimens until they flowered, at which time the petals were observed to be longer and more widely spaced than modern versions of the plant. The reasons for the observed variations are not known. Seeds produced by the regenerated plants germinated at a 100% success rate, compared with 90% for modern plants. According to Robin Probert of the Millennium Seed Bank , the demonstration is \"by far the most extraordinary example of extreme longevity for material from higher plants\" to date. It is not surprising to find living material this old, but is surprising that viable material could be recovered, she added. The Russian scientists speculated that the tissue cells were rich in sucrose which acted as a preservative. They also noted that DNA damage caused by gamma radiation from natural ground radioactivity at the site was unusually low for the plant material's age and is comparable to levels observed in 1300-year-old",

      "text": "Aspidistra / ˌ æ s p ɪ ˈ d ɪ s t r ə / is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae , subfamily Convallarioideae , native to eastern and southeastern Asia, particularly China and Vietnam . They grow in shade under trees and shrubs. Their leaves arise more or less directly from ground level, where their flowers also appear. The number of species known has increased considerably from the 1980s onwards, with around 100 accepted as of July 2013 [update] . Aspidistra elatior is common worldwide as a foliage house plant that is very tolerant of neglect. It and other species can also be grown in shade outside, where they are generally hardy to −15 °C (5 °F). Description Species of Aspidistra are perennial herbaceous plants growing from rhizomes . The leaves are either solitary or are grouped in small \"tufts\" of two to four. They arise more or less directly from the rhizome, rather than being borne on stems. Each leaf has a long stalk ( petiole ) and a blade with many veins. The flowering stem ( scape ) is usually very short so that the flowers appear low down among the leaves. The fleshy flowers are bell-, urn- or cup-shaped. They vary considerably in size and shape, although few are showy. The flowers of A. longipedunculata are yellow and, unusually for the genus, are borne on scapes up to 20 cm (8 in) high. A. grandiflora has spider-like flowers up to 12 cm (5 in) across. The flower has a large stigma with a flattened top. The fruit is a berry , often with a single seed. Taxonomy The genus Aspidistra was named by the English botanist John Ker Gawler in 1822, as a blend of Greek ασπίς/ασπίδ- aspid- , meaning shield, and the name of the sister genus Tupistra . The genus was at one time placed in a broadly defined Liliaceae, along with many other lilioid monocots . It has also been placed in the families Convallariaceae and Ruscaceae. The APG III system of 2009 places it in the family Asparagaceae , subfamily Convallarioideae . Species Aspidistra is a genus that was largely ignored by field botanists until the 1980s onwards, and there has been a rapid rise in the number of recognised species since then. Some 8 to 10 species were known in the late 1970s; 30 new species were described from China in the 1980s. Subsequently, more new species were found in Vietnam.

It details their physical traits—palmate antlers, seasonal coat changes—and adaptable, region-specific diets. Nomenclature across languages reflects the deer’s pale coloration and antler shape. Evolutionarily, Dama emerged near the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary (~2.6 Ma) and diversified through the Middle Pleistocene; palmate antlers evolved only in later species such as D. pelleponesica and D. clactoniana, the latter considered ancestral to modern forms. Extinct species formerly placed in Pseudodama are discussed, and mitochondrial DNA places Dama as the closest living relative of the giant extinct Megaloceros.  \n\n**Keywords**:  \nDama, fallow deer, palmate antlers, Pleistocene evolution, Megaloceros",
