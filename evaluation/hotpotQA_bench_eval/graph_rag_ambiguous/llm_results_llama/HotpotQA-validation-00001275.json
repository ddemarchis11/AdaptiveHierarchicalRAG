      "text": "Roger Keith \" Syd \" Barrett (6 January 1946 – 7 July 2006) was an English singer, guitarist and songwriter who co-founded the rock band Pink Floyd in 1965. Until his departure in 1968, he was Pink Floyd's frontman and primary songwriter, known for his whimsical style of psychedelia and stream-of-consciousness writing. As a guitarist, he was influential for his free-form playing and for employing effects such as dissonance , distortion , echo and feedback . Trained as a painter, Barrett was musically active for just over ten years. With Pink Floyd, he recorded the first three singles, their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967), part of their second album A Saucerful of Secrets (1968), and several songs that were not released until later. He left the band in April 1968 amid speculation of mental illness and his use of psychedelic drugs , beginning a brief solo career the following year with the single \" Octopus \", followed by albums The Madcap Laughs (1970) and Barrett (1970), recorded with the help of Pink Floyd and the Soft Machine . In 1974, Barrett left the music industry, retired from public life and guarded his privacy until his death. He continued painting and dedicated himself to gardening. Pink Floyd recorded several tributes and homages, including the 1975 song suite \" Shine On You Crazy Diamond \" and parts of the 1979 rock opera The Wall . In 1988, EMI released an album of unreleased tracks and outtakes, Opel , with Barrett's approval. In 1996, Barrett was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. He died of pancreatic cancer in 2006. Early life Roger Keith Barrett was born on 6 January 1946 in Cambridge as the fourth of five children to a middle-class family living at 60 Glisson Road. His father, Arthur Max Barrett , was a prominent pathologist and was said to be related to Elizabeth Garrett Anderson through Max's maternal grandmother Ellen Garrett. In 1951, his family moved to 183 Hills Road, Cambridge . Barrett played piano occasionally but usually preferred writing and drawing. He bought a ukulele aged 10, a banjo at 11 and a Höfner acoustic guitar at 14. Initially playing acoustic guitar, he later purchased a Selmer Futurama III, electric. He was a Scout with the 7th Cambridge troop and went on to be a patrol leader. Barrett reportedly used the nickname Syd from the age of 14, derived from the name of an old Cambridge jazz bassist, Sid \"the Beat\" Barrett; Barrett changed the spelling to differentiate himself. By another account, when Barrett was 13, his schoolmates nicknamed him Syd after he came to a field day at Abington Scout site wearing a flat cap instead of his",

Conducting a rotating ensemble known as the Magic Band , he recorded 13 studio albums between 1967 and 1982. His music blended elements of blues , free jazz , rock , and avant-garde composition with idiosyncratic rhythms, absurdist wordplay, and Vliet’s gravelly singing voice with a wide vocal range . Known as an enigmatic persona, Beefheart frequently constructed myths about his life and was known to exercise extreme, dictatorial control over his supporting musicians. Although he achieved little commercial success, he sustained a cult following as an influence on an array of experimental rock and punk -era artists. He began performing in his Captain Beefheart persona in 1964, when he joined the original Magic Band line-up. The group's 1969 album Trout Mask Replica would rank 58th in Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . Beefheart eventually formed a new Magic Band with a group of younger musicians and regained critical approval through three final albums: Shiny Beast (1978), Doc at the Radar Station (1980) and Ice Cream for Crow (1982). In 1982, he retired from music and pursued a career in art. His abstract expressionist paintings and drawings command high prices, and have been exhibited in art galleries and museums across the world. Early life Van Vliet was born Don Glen Vliet in Glendale, California , on January 15, 1941, to Glen Alonzo Vliet, a service station owner from Kansas , and Willie Sue Vliet ( née Warfield), who was from Arkansas . Van Vliet said that he was descended from adventurer and author Richard Halliburton and related to actor Slim Pickens , and that he remembered being born. Vliet began painting and sculpting at age three. His subjects reflected his \"obsession\" with animals, particularly dinosaurs , fish, African mammals and lemurs . Considered a child prodigy, at age four he was featured with his animal sculptures on a Los Angeles television program. At the age of nine, he won a children's sculpting competition organized for the Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith Park by local tutor and sculptor, Agostinho Rodrigues. During the 1950s, Vliet worked as an apprentice with Rodrigues, who considered him a prodigy. Van Vliet said that he was a lecturer at the Barnsdall Art Institute in Los Angeles at the age of eleven, although it is likely he simply gave a form of artistic dissertation. He said that his parents",

The band started the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists: Eric Clapton (1963–1965), Jeff Beck (1965–1966) and Jimmy Page (1966–1968), all of whom ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone magazine's 2011 list of 100 greatest guitarists. The band's other members during 1963–1968 were vocalist/harmonica player Keith Relf , drummer Jim McCarty , rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja , and bassist Paul Samwell-Smith , with Dreja switching to bass when Samwell-Smith departed in 1966. The band had a string of hits in the mid-1960s, including \" For Your Love \", \" Heart Full of Soul \", \" Shapes of Things \" and \" Over Under Sideways Down \". Originally a blues -based band noted for their signature \"rave-up\" instrumental breaks, the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop , pioneered psychedelic rock and early hard rock , and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s. Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock , progressive rock and heavy metal trends. Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance , and Page formed Led Zeppelin . The Yardbirds re-formed in the 1990s, featuring McCarty and Dreja as the only original members. Dreja left the band in 2012, leaving McCarty as the sole original member of the band. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. They were included at number 89 in Rolling Stone 's list of the \" 100 Greatest Artists of All Time \" and ranked number 37 on VH1 's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock .

After being joined by Dreja, McCarty and Anthony \"Top\" Topham , they performed at Kingston Art School in late May 1963 as a backup band for Cyril Davies . Following a couple of gigs in September 1963 as the Blue-Sounds, they changed their name to the Yardbirds. McCarty claims that Relf was the first to use the name; he may have got it from Jack Kerouac 's novel On the Road , where it referred to railroad yard hoboes .

      "text": "Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd , released on 12 September 1975 through Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and a day later in the United States through Columbia Records , as their first album for the label. Based on material Pink Floyd composed while performing in Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded over numerous sessions throughout 1975 at EMI Studios in London. The lyrics express longing, alienation, and sardonic criticism of the music industry. The bulk of the album is taken up by \" Shine On You Crazy Diamond \", a nine-part tribute to Syd Barrett , a Pink Floyd co-founder who had left seven years earlier due to his deteriorating mental health; Barrett coincidentally visited the studio during recording. As with their previous release, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd employed studio effects and synthesisers . Guest singers included Roy Harper , who sang lead on \" Have a Cigar \", and Venetta Fields , who sang backing vocals on \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". To promote the album, Pink Floyd released the double A-side single \"Have a Cigar\" / \" Welcome to the Machine \". Wish You Were Here topped charts in several countries, including the UK Albums Chart and US Billboard 200 . It was certified gold in the UK and US in its year of release, and by 2004, it had sold an estimated 13 million copies worldwide. Upon release, it received mixed reviews from critics, who found its music \"uninspiring\" and \"inferior\" to the group's previous work. However, it has later been acclaimed as one of the greatest albums of all time, with Rolling Stone ranking it number 264 in their 2020 revision of their \" 500 Greatest Albums of All Time \" list. Keyboardist Richard Wright , drummer Nick Mason , and guitarist David Gilmour have cited it as their favourite Pink Floyd album, while bassist Roger Waters called it their \"most complete\" album. Background In 1974, Pink Floyd sketched out three new songs, \" Raving and Drooling \", \" You Gotta Be Crazy \", and \" Shine On You Crazy Diamond \". These songs were performed during a series of concerts in France and England , the band's first tour since 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon . As Pink Floyd had never employed a publicist and kept themselves distant from the press, their relationship with the media began to sour. Nick Mason said later that a critical NME review by Nick Kent , who Mason felt preferred the band's earlier music, may have influenced the band to return to the studio during the first week of 1975. Concept Wish You Were Here is the second Pink Floyd album with a conceptual theme, mostly at Roger Waters ' direction, reflecting his feeling that the previous communal structure of the band had disappeared in favour of more professional musicianship. \"I had some criticisms of Dark Side of the Moon ,\"",

He is the lead singer, songwriter and guitarist of the rock band Nagar Baul (previously Feelings). He is often referred by the name \" Guru \" which means \"master\" or \"teacher\". James was born and raised in Naogaon , but grew up in Chittagong city. James rose to mainstream fame in the 1990s as the frontman of Feelings, one of the \"Big Three of Bangla Rock\", who were responsible for developing and popularizing hard rock music in Bangladesh, along with LRB and Ark . Feelings is considered to be the pioneer of psychedelic rock in Bangladesh. James has also led a successful solo career, with hit albums like Ononna (1989), Palabe Kothay (1995), Dukhini Dukkho Korona (1997), Thik Achhe Bondhu (1999). He sang in four Bollywood films, including Gangster (2006), Woh Lamhe (2006), Life in a... Metro (2007), and Warning (2013). James won Bangladesh National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer twice for his performance in the films of Desha: The Leader (2014) and Swatta (2017). Early life James was born on 2 October 1964 to Mojammel Haque and Jahanara Khatun in Naogaon , Rajshahi in the then East Pakistan . Mojammel was a government employee and worked as the chairman of the Dhaka Education Board . Owing to his father’s professional transfers, James began his education at Blue Bird School in Sylhet and later attended Rajshahi Collegiate School . He spent his college years in Nilphamari and Sirajganj. After completing college, James developed a strong interest in music. As no one in his family had any musical background, his parents were opposed to his decision to pursue a career as a singer. Defying his parents’ wishes, James left home while he was in class eight in 1976 to follow his passion for music. He eventually took residence at room 36 at Aziz Boarding, located at Pathantuli Road in the Kadamtali area of Chittagong City. The boarding house was the center of his early musical activities, where he spent most of his time composing songs and practicing music. From his teens, James developed an avid interest in music, an interest which his family did not accept or support. In the early-to-mid 1970s, while learning guitar, James became interested in bands like The Doors , Dire Straits , Led Zeppelin and guitarists like Eric Clapton , Mark Knopfler and Jimi Hendrix .

The sessions for Wish You Were Here at EMI's Studio Three (now Abbey Road Studios) lasted from January until July 1975, recording on four days each week from 2:30 pm until very late in the evening. The group found it difficult at first to devise any new material, especially as the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left all four physically and emotionally drained. Keyboardist Richard Wright later described these sessions as \"falling within a difficult period\", and Waters recalled them as \"torturous\". Mason found the process of multi-track recording to be \"tedious\", while Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Gilmour was also becoming increasingly frustrated with Mason, whose failing marriage had brought on a general malaise and sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming. Gilmour said the band had realised their dreams of becoming rich and famous musicians, and so had to \"reassess what [they] were in it for thereafter, and it was a pretty confusing and sort of empty time for a while\". Humphries recalled days of inactivity: \"I don't think they knew what they wanted to do. We had a dartboard and an air rifle and we'd play these word games, sit around, get drunk, go home and return the next day. That's all we were doing until suddenly everything started falling into place.\" After several weeks, Waters began to visualise another concept. The three new compositions from the 1974 tours were at least a starting point for a new album, and \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" seemed a reasonable choice as a centrepiece for the new work. Mostly an instrumental 20-minute-plus piece similar to \" Echoes \", the opening four-note guitar phrase reminded Waters of Barrett. Gilmour had composed the phrase while improvising, but was encouraged by Waters' positive response to make it the focus of the song. A subtle refrain performed by Wright, lifted from \" See Emily Play \", is also audible towards the end. Waters wanted to split \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", and sandwich two new songs between its two halves. Gilmour disagreed, but was outvoted three to one. \"Welcome to the Machine\" and \"Have a Cigar\" were attacks on the music business, their lyrics working with \"Shine On\" to provide a summary of the rise and fall of Barrett; \"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... that sort of indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\" \"Raving and Drooling\" and \"You've Got To Be Crazy\" had no place in the new concept, and were set aside until the following album, 1977's Animals .

Between 1965 and early 1968 he wrote the bulk of their debut album *The Piper at the Gates of Dawn*, the singles “Arnold Layne” and “See Emily Play,” and several unreleased tracks. Heavy LSD use, coupled with mounting mental-health issues, eroded Barrett’s reliability—he forgot lyrics, detuned guitars on stage, and stared blankly through TV appearances. By late 1967 the group recruited David Gilmour as auxiliary guitarist; in January 1968 they quietly stopped collecting Barrett for gigs, effectively ending his tenure. Only “Jugband Blues” and a few instrumental contributions survived onto *A Saucerful of Secrets*, marking the transition from Barrett’s whimsical leadership to Waters-led experimentation.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nSyd Barrett, Pink Floyd, psychedelic rock, LSD decline, *Piper at the Gates of Dawn*",
