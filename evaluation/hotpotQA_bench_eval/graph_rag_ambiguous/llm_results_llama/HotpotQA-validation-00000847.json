      "text": "The daiquiri ( / ˈ d aɪ k ər i , ˈ d æ k -/ ; Spanish : daiquirí [dajkiˈɾi] ) is a cocktail whose main ingredients are rum , citrus juice (typically lime juice ), and sugar or other sweetener. The daiquiri is one of the six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury 's classic The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , which also lists some variations. Origins Daiquirí is also the name of a beach and an iron mine near Santiago de Cuba in eastern Cuba, and is a word of Taíno origin. Historians widely agree that the cocktail was invented by an American mining engineer named Jennings Cox , who was in Cuba (then at the tail-end of the Spanish Captaincy-General government ) at the time of the Spanish–American War of 1898. It is also possible that William A. Chanler , a US congressman who purchased the Santiago iron mines in 1902, introduced the daiquiri to clubs in New York in that year. Originally the drink was served in a tall glass packed with cracked ice. A teaspoon of sugar was poured over the ice, and the juice of one or two limes was squeezed over the sugar. Two or three ounces of white rum completed the mixture. The glass was then frosted with a long-handled spoon . Later the daiquiri evolved to be mixed in a shaker with the same ingredients but with shaved ice. After a thorough shaking, it was poured into a chilled coupe glass . The Daiquiri was subsequently refined and popularized by Emelio “Maragato” Gonzalez and Constantino “Constante” Ribalaigua Vert in Havana. The basic recipe for a daiquiri is also similar to the grog British sailors drank aboard ships from the 1780s. By 1795 the Royal Navy daily grog ration contained rum, water, ¾ ounce of lemon or lime juice, and 2 ounces of sugar. This was a common drink across the Caribbean, and as soon as ice became available this was included instead of the water. Consumption of the drink remained localized until 1909, when Rear Admiral Lucius W. Johnson, a U.S. Navy medical officer, tried Cox's drink. Johnson subsequently introduced it to the Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C. , and drinkers of the daiquiri increased over the space of a few decades. It was one of the favorite drinks of the writer Ernest Hemingway and U.S. President John F. Kennedy . The drink became popular in the 1940s. World War II rationing made whiskey and vodka hard to come by, yet rum was easily obtainable owing to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's Good Neighbor policy , which opened up trade and travel relations with Latin America, Cuba, and the Caribbean. The Good Neighbor policy, also known",

The Good Neighbor policy, also known as the Pan-American program, helped make Latin America fashionable. [ according to whom? ] Consequently, rum-based drinks (once frowned upon as the choice of sailors and down-and-outs) also became fashionable, and the daiquiri saw tremendous popularity in the US.

Frozen daiquiri A wide variety of alcoholic mixed drinks made with finely pulverized ice are often called frozen daiquirí . These drinks can also be combined and poured from a blender , eliminating the need for manual pulverisation and producing a texture similar to a smoothie . On larger scales, such drinks are often commercially made in larger machines and come in various flavors with various alcohol or liquors. Another way to create a frozen daiquiri (mostly fruit-flavored variants) is by using frozen limeade , providing the required texture, sweetness and sourness all at once.

Amundsen also planned to kill most of his dogs on the way and use them as a source for fresh meat. As he went he butchered some of the dogs and fed them to the remaining dogs, as well as eating some himself. A small group, including Hjalmar Johansen , Kristian Prestrud and Jørgen Stubberud , set out on 8 September, but had to abandon their trek due to extreme temperatures. The painful retreat caused a quarrel within the group, and Amundsen sent Johansen and the other two men to explore King Edward VII Land . A second attempt, with a team of five made up of Olav Bjaaland , Helmer Hanssen , Sverre Hassel , Oscar Wisting and Amundsen, departed base camp on 19 October. They took four sledges and 52 dogs. Using a route along the previously unknown Axel Heiberg Glacier , they arrived at the edge of the Polar Plateau on 21 November after a four-day climb. The team and 16 dogs arrived at the pole on 14 December, a month before Scott's group. Amundsen named their South Pole camp Polheim . Amundsen renamed the Antarctic Plateau as King Haakon VII's Plateau. They left a small tent and letter stating their accomplishment, in case they did not return safely to Framheim. The team arrived at Framheim on 25 January 1912, with 11 surviving dogs. They made their way off the continent and to Hobart , Australia, where Amundsen publicly announced his success on 7 March 1912. He telegraphed news to backers. Amundsen's expedition benefited from his careful preparation, good equipment, appropriate clothing, a simple primary task, an understanding of dogs and their handling, and the effective use of skis. In contrast to the misfortunes of Scott's team, Amundsen's trek proved relatively smooth and uneventful. North Polar Expeditions and the Northeast Passage The Northeast Passage Maud in June 1918 In 1918, an expedition Amundsen began with a new ship, Maud , lasted until 1925. Maud was carefully navigated through the ice west to east through the Northeast Passage . With him on this expedition were Oscar Wisting and Helmer Hanssen, both of whom had been part of the team to reach the South Pole. In addition, Henrik Lindstrøm was included as a cook. He suffered a stroke and was so physically reduced that he could not participate. The goal of the expedition was to explore the unknown areas of the Arctic Ocean, strongly inspired by Fridtjof Nansen's earlier",

      "text": "that Ursine bears originated around five million years ago, with extensive hybridization among the different species. Fossils of polar bears are uncommon. The oldest known fossil is a 130,000- to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland , Norway, in 2004. Scientists in the 20th century surmised that polar bears directly descended from a population of brown bears, possibly in eastern Siberia or Alaska . Mitochondrial DNA studies in the 1990s and 2000s supported the status of the polar bear as a derivative of the brown bear, finding that some brown bear populations were more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, particularly the ABC Islands bears of Southeast Alaska . A 2010 study estimated that the polar bear lineage split from other brown bears around 150,000 years ago. Polar/brown bear hybrid taxidermy specimen on display at Natural History Museum at Tring in Hertfordshire , England More extensive genetic studies have refuted the idea that polar bears are directly descended from brown bears and found that the two species are separate sister lineages . The genetic similarities between polar bears and some brown bears were found to be the result of interbreeding. A 2012 study estimated the split between polar and brown bears as occurring around 600,000 years ago. A 2022 study estimated the divergence as occurring even earlier at over one million years ago. Glaciation events over hundreds of thousands of years led to both the origin of polar bears and their subsequent interactions and hybridizations with brown bears. Studies in 2011 and 2012 concluded that gene flow went from brown bears to polar bears during hybridization. In particular, a 2011 study concluded that living polar bear populations derived their maternal lines from now-extinct Irish brown bears. Later studies have clarified that gene flow went from polar to brown bears rather than the reverse. Up to 9 percent of the genome of ABC bears was transferred from polar bears, while Irish bears had up to 21.5 percent polar bear origin. Mass hybridization between the two species appears to have stopped around 200,000 years ago. Modern hybrids are relatively rare in the wild. Analysis of the number of variations of gene copies in polar bears compared with brown bears and American black bears shows distinct adaptions. Polar bears have a less diverse array of olfactory receptor genes, a result of there being fewer odours in their Arctic habitat. With its carnivorous, high-fat diet the species has fewer copies of the gene involved in making amylase , an enzyme that breaks down starch , and more selection for genes for fatty acid breakdown and a more efficient circulatory system . The polar bear's thicker coat is the result of more copies of genes involved in keratin -creating proteins.

      "text": "Ground bow dyulu tama in Fouta Djallon region of Guinea, 1908 The ground-bow , also known as an earth-bow or ground harp , is a single-string bow-shaped folk musical instrument, classified as a chordophone . It is known in cultures of equatorial and south Africa, and in other cultures with African roots. It consists of a flexible stick planted into the ground (possibly a stripped sapling or a branch ), with a string from its free end to a resonator of some kind based on a pit in the ground. It looks like a game trap or a child toy, therefore its distribution over Africa used to be overlooked. Hornbostel (1933) classified is in the category of harps , although it has combined characteristics of a harp and a musical bow . The resonator may be a pit covered by a board, with string attached to it. Kruges describes several other constructions by Venda, e.g., the other end of a string is tied to a stone dropped into the pit, with string passing through the board covering the pit, etc. Other names include kalinga or galinga by Venda people . In their language \"galinga\" means simply a hole in the ground, while the origins of \"kalinga\" are uncertain. It is known as gayumba in Haiti , Dominican Republic , and tumbandera in Haitian traditions of Cuba . Baka people call it angbindi . It is also known in Cuba under the onomatopoeic name tingo-talango ( tingotalango ). Julio Cueva 's song Tingo Talango dedicated to this musical instrument describes its construction thus: Si quieren que les describa cómo es el tingo talango tráiganme un gajo de güira o si no uno de mango. Se abre un hueco en el suelo, encima una hoja de lata, en el centro un agujero donde un alambre se ata. Translation: If you want me to describe how is the tingo talango bring me a slice of güira or if not, one of mango. A hole opens in the ground a tin sheet on top, in the center a hole where a wire is tied. Tingo Talango is also the song by Ñico Lora . The instrument is reportedly nearly-extinct in the native cultures. Playing techniques Kalinga may be struck by a stick or plucked in various ways. The bow stick may be bent to change the tension of the string, and hence the tone. It can be played in a glissando manner: the stick is bent, struck, and released, producing a peculiar sound. The produced pitches are not always stable. Kalinga is usually played to provide repetitive accompaniment to the choral song.

The \"intuition frog\" Valli subsequently returned to Turkey to experiment with the inoculation of smallpox vaccine to protect against the plague. Indeed, over the years, he had developed the theory according to which infection by smallpox excluded infection by the plague, and vice versa. Thus, he held, there were two “poisonous pura”, one produced by the plague and the other by smallpox, and contamination between the two would give rise to a “good pus”, which was potentially curative. On 31 May 1792, Valli became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences in Turin. In 1799, in Livorno, Valli partly reproduced experiments conducted by the French abbot, mathematician and physician Robert Rimbaud Deidier (1670–1746). Since 1772, he had succeeded in immunising several animals by inoculating saliva taken from a hydrophobic dog; one of the animals inoculated with the saliva, to which gastric juice from frogs had been added, contracted rabies . With this preparation, He succeeded in treating a certain Pisan lady named Rosermini and her maidservant , achieving a very good result. There, he treated an officer's wife, who had been bitten by a rabid dog; she did not contract rabies. Accompanied by Dr. Antonio Mendoza , in 1816 he visited San Juan de Dios ' Hospital, where he studied the epidemiology of yellow fever . Most of Valli's discoveries were eclipsed for many years, until Edward Jenner carried out his studies on vaccination. At that point, Casciana Alta's inhabitants put across how their countryman, Eusebio, mostly devoted his life to that field of studies, in this way making his fame grow exponentially .
