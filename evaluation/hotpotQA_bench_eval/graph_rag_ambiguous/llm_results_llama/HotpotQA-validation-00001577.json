      "text": "Didsbury is a suburb of Manchester , England, on the north bank of the River Mersey , 5 miles (8 kilometres) south of Manchester city centre . The population at the 2011 census was 26,788. Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire , there are records of Didsbury existing as a small hamlet as early as the 13th century. Its early history was dominated by being part of the Manor of Withington , a feudal estate that covered a large part of what is now the south of Manchester. Didsbury was described during the 18th century as a township separate from outside influence. In 1745 a section of the Jacobite army including the Duke of Perth crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby. Didsbury was largely rural until the mid-19th century, when it underwent development and urbanisation during the Industrial Revolution . It became part of Manchester in 1904. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was formed in Didsbury in 1889. History Toponymy Didsbury derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon Dyddi's burg , probably referring to a man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township it was on a low cliff overlooking a place where the River Mersey could be forded. In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre, Dydesbiri, Didsbury or Dodesbury. Parish church Church of St James, Didsbury in 2013 A charter granted in about 1260 shows that a corn-grinding mill was operating in Didsbury, along the River Mersey, but the earliest reference to Didsbury is in a document dating from 1235, recording a grant of land for the building of a chapel. The church was named St James Church in 1855. It underwent major refurbishment in 1620 and again in the 19th century, although most of the stonework visible today dates from the 17th century. A parsonage was built next to one of the two public houses that flanked the nearby village green, Ye Olde Cock Inn, so-called because of the cockfighting that used to take place there. The parsonage soon gained a reputation for being haunted; servants refused to sleep on the premises, and it was abandoned in 1850. Local alderman Fletcher Moss bought the house in 1865, and lived in it for more than 40 years. In 1902, he installed a gateway complete with wrought iron gates which he purchased from the soon to be demolished Spread Eagle Hotel in central Manchester which he once owned, at the entrance to the parsonage's garden, which, because of the building's reputation, became known locally as \"the gates to Hell\". The parsonage is now open to the community and",

      "text": "Northenden is a suburb of Manchester , in Greater Manchester , England, with a population of 15,064 at the 2021 census . It lies on the south side of the River Mersey , 4 miles (6.4 km) west of Stockport and 5 miles (8.0 km) south of Manchester city centre , bounded by Didsbury to the north, Gatley to the east, Sale to the west and Wythenshawe to the south. Historically a rural township and parish within the hundred of Bucklow in Cheshire , despite unplanned urbanisation and population growth in its neighbours in the 19th century, Northenden remained a comparatively rural and unpopulated area which spanned the hamlets of Lawton Moor, Northern Moor , Rose Hill and a part of what is now Wythenshawe. By 1866 Northenden had coalesced and became a civil parish . The industrialisation of neighbouring Manchester resulted in overpopulation in the early 20th century. Manchester City Council used the Local Government Act 1929 to extend its boundaries to encompass Northenden in 1931 and throughout the mid-20th century it was redeveloped as an overspill estate . History Northenden was mentioned as Norwordine in the Domesday Book of 1086; its name came from Anglo-Saxon Norþ-worþign = \"north enclosure\". It was then a small farming community with a manor house and woodland. In later times Northenden was sometimes called Northen. There was a weir on the Mersey in the 14th century (where Mill Lane is now), and a mill was set up there to grind corn. It is recorded in the 16th century as belonging to the Tatton family of Wythenshawe Hall , who had the right to make all their tenants use the mill on payment of a fee. The weir and mill were demolished in the early 1960s. As Northenden is on a major (and very old) crossing place of the Mersey on the salt road from Cheshire to Manchester, it prospered in medieval times. The ford was an important way into and out of and into Manchester (now Ford Lane), as there was no bridge over the Mersey between Sale and Stockport , until in 1745 Bonnie Prince Charlie 's army built a troop-bridge out of big poplar tree trunks where the B5095 (Manchester Road, Didsbury) now crosses the Mersey, south of Didsbury , in his abortive attempt to seize the crown of England. The Northenden ford was unusual because its northern and southern ends were not opposite each other, but people using the ford had to wade about 500 feet along the riverbed. The Simon's Bridge was built at the ford in 1901 to help access to Poor's Field, and the rent from this field was used by the",

It was headquartered in Didsbury , Manchester, England, it operated a network of domestic and European services from a number of airports in the United Kingdom on behalf of British Airways . The airline operated as a low-cost carrier , with food sold via a ' buy on board ' programme (except for flights to London City Airport ). On 3 November 2006, British Airways announced the sale of BA Connect to Flybe . It formally transferred to Flybe on 25 March 2007. History Dash 8-311Q in 2006 The company was incorporated on 26 January 1970 as Brymon Aviation Limited which operated as Brymon Airways . On 30 July 1993 the company was renamed Brymon Airways Limited to reflect the operating name. The company was purchased by British Airways in 1993 and on 28 March 2002 it was merged with British Regional Airlines and was renamed British Airways Citiexpress Ltd operating as BA CitiExpress . British Airways Citiexpress is recognised for pioneering and attaining CAA approval for the print-at-home boarding pass, one of the first self-service tools of the digital era. The regional operations of British Airways at Birmingham and Manchester, and the operations of the former CityFlyer Express , were integrated into the new airline later in 2002. On 1 February 2006 the airline was renamed BA Connect Limited operating as BA Connect and operations moved to a low-cost carrier model, with food sold via a ' buy on board ' programme (except for flights to London City Airport ). However, allocated seating and a baggage valet service were still available, while lounge access, tier points and BA Miles remained unaffected for those in the Executive Club. Operationally the new service came into effect on 26 March 2006. BAe 146-200 departing Manchester Airport in 2007 BA Connect handled most of British Airways' domestic and European services that do not serve London’s Heathrow or Gatwick airports. It had hubs in Birmingham , Bristol , London–City , Manchester and Southampton . From these locations the carrier operated services to several northwest European destinations and also to Glasgow , Edinburgh and Aberdeen . A few services also operated from Gatwick. In total, BA Connect flew from 17 airports in the UK and Ireland on 63 routes to major or central regional airports. On 3 November 2006, British Airways chief executive said that he had reached an agreement for Flybe to purchase BA Connect. BA would ensure that Flybe has sufficient funding in order to achieve its growth targets and the transition out of current BA Connect fleet. In return BA would acquire a 15% stake in the new business. The acquisition (which did not include BA Connect routes to London City or from Manchester to New York) would significantly increase the Flybe route network in both the UK and continental Europe, making Flybe the largest regional airline in",

Tafo is the thirtieth most populous settlement in Ghana, in terms of population, with a population of 60,919 people. Because of the town's population and housing development in recent years, it is debatable whether Tafo is still regarded as a separate town, or already a suburb of Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti region. The town is near Kumasi, with a distance of approximately 3.3 kilometers to the center of a similar name sounding village named New Tafo and must be distinguished from Tafo (However per traditional/kingship administrative system new Tafo and Old Tafo are basically run by a single Chief who happens to be the leader of the left wing of Kumasi Traditional council. Its therefore under same authority but political administration runs them separately. Nana Tafohene is the Chief of both Tafo which comprises the two). Tarkwa is located just 4.6 km away from Tafo. The city center of Kumasi is located approximately 9.8 kilometers away. Tafo is one of the urban constituencies of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly . The town's parliamentary candidate shall have one direct seat to the Parliament of Ghana . History Tafo is also due to its history of a regional headquarters of Ashanti-King, the Tafohene. An important Cocoa Research Institute was opened in June 1938 at Tafo. At one point the institute had 1,000 employees. Now it only has about 200 employees who perform essentially research and monitoring activities in the area of cocoa cultivation. On test fields in the laboratory and the biological control, African locust are tested and developed with specific pathogens. In the census of 18 March 1983, there was 25,688 people living in Tafo.

      "text": "Eastern Airways was a British regional airline headquartered at Humberside Airport near the village of Kirmington , North Lincolnshire , England. The airline operated domestic, international and private charter flights. Around 1,300,000 passengers flew with the airline per rolling year including on services for KLM Cityhopper, charter operations, and government subsidised public service obligation (PSO) services which would otherwise be commercially unfeasible. The airline had its own hubs in Aberdeen and Humberside . Air Kilroe held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence. It was permitted to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats and was IOSA approved. History Early years Co-founded by Bryan Huxford and Richard Lake, the airline started operations in December 1997 with a scheduled route between Humberside and Aberdeen with a leased Swearingen Metro , following KLM UK's withdrawal from the route. In February 1999, it purchased Manchester based Air Kilroe , thereby acquiring an air operator's certificate and a fleet of two BAe Jetstream 32 aircraft. In 2002, the first BAe Jetstream 41 entered the Eastern fleet, the aircraft type which formed the majority of the fleet up until the airline ceased operations. 12 aircraft and their associated routes were transferred from British Airways CitiExpress on 30 March 2003. An Embraer 145 and 135 were also wet-leased from City Airline in 2003, which were then replaced with Saab 2000 aircraft, which peaked at 8 being operated by 2013 including acquisitions from Crossair and other European carriers. In 2006, Eastern Airways wet-leased a Dornier 328 from Cirrus Airlines for six months to operate a Newcastle to London City service before switching this onto the BAe Jetstream 41. Eastern Airways also purchased a Jetstream 41 training simulator . As part of One NorthEast 's \"Passionate People Passionate Places\" campaign for North East England , Eastern Airways had a Jetstream 41 painted in promotional colours. It also featured in the 2007 Sunderland International Airshow . A Saab 2000 was also painted in a promotional 'Aberdeen City and Shire' colour scheme. The airline shut down its hub at the Isle of Man in August 2009, discontinuing routes to Birmingham and Newcastle from the airport. 2010s In July 2010, the airline took delivery of an Embraer 135 with 37 seats and signed a lease on a second, thus adding jet aircraft to their fleet for the first time since the acquisition to replace their previously operated Embraer ERJ aircraft. They were to be used mainly on charter services to central and Eastern Europe; however, they also offered increased flexibility on the airline's scheduled flights. In July 2010, the airline named one of their BAe Jetstream 41 aircraft",

Eastern Airways and Flybe franchise An Eastern BAe Jetstream 41 , operated for Flybe It was announced on 21 September 2017 that Eastern Airways would enter a franchise with Flybe, starting on 29 October 2017. The franchise saw all scheduled flights operated by Eastern Airways carry BE (Flybe) flight numbers. Following Loganair's decision to end its partnership with Flybe, to remain on multiple markets flyBe announced a significant expansion onto routes also operated by Loganair using Eastern Airways to operate the services, largely targeting the Scottish Highlands , including introduction jet service into Sumburgh for the first time as part of the operating plan flyBe contracted Eastern Airways to provide. The last of these new routes was dropped by the end of 2018, citing a lack of demand for two competing airlines given capacity had doubled on many with a static market size. 2020s On 5 March 2020, Flybe entered administration and ceased operations, resulting in Eastern Airways resuming flying under its own brand. Seeking to take advantage of Flybe's demise, the airline announced the opening of a base at Southampton , where Flybe had operated 95% of the airport's flights, with new routes to Manchester and Newcastle, eventually being joined by Belfast City and Dublin , along with pre-existing service to Aberdeen, Leeds Bradford and Teesside . The routes from Manchester were subsequently cancelled. In May 2021, Eastern commenced flying to Gibraltar for the first time, with services from both Birmingham and Southampton airports, however cancelled both routes a year later as international travel remained in slow recovery post Covid-19. The airline also commenced service between Cardiff and Belfast City, seeking to fill another gap left by Flybe's collapse, but suspended the route in early 2022 after the Welsh Government decided to permanently cancel the PSO service between Cardiff and Anglesey suspended during Covid-19, thus rendering the airline's Cardiff base unviable as a single route operation.

KLM Cityhopper In March 2024, Eastern Airways commenced an ACMI on behalf of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, taking over the operation of the Humberside Airport and Teesside Airport KLM services to the Netherlands with additional flying to Manchester , Glasgow , Newcastle and Norwich on two 100-seat Embraer E190 E-Jets. By October 2024 this had expanded to three Embraer 190 aircraft with the addition of Bristol as a base for KLM including operating to Southampton and Cardiff, and by March 2025 a fourth UK base had been added at Bristol with the addition of a fourth Embraer 190, bringing the airlines weekly seat capacity for KLM to 22,400 and over 1.15 million per year.

KLM Cityhopper ceased the contract with Eastern Airways on 5 October 2025, just a few weeks before Eastern Airways ceased operations. Administration On 27 October 2025, Eastern Airways filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, which resulted in the suspension of all flight operations. On 31 October, the majority of Eastern Airways' staff were made redundant. The company formally went into administration on 6 November 2025.
