      "text": "Don Van Vliet ( / v æ n ˈ v l iː t / ; born Don Glen Vliet ; January 15, 1941 – December 17, 2010), known by his stage name Captain Beefheart , was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and visual artist. Conducting a rotating ensemble known as the Magic Band , he recorded 13 studio albums between 1967 and 1982. His music blended elements of blues , free jazz , rock , and avant-garde composition with idiosyncratic rhythms, absurdist wordplay, and Vliet’s gravelly singing voice with a wide vocal range . Known as an enigmatic persona, Beefheart frequently constructed myths about his life and was known to exercise extreme, dictatorial control over his supporting musicians. Although he achieved little commercial success, he sustained a cult following as an influence on an array of experimental rock and punk -era artists. He began performing in his Captain Beefheart persona in 1964, when he joined the original Magic Band line-up. The group's 1969 album Trout Mask Replica would rank 58th in Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . Beefheart eventually formed a new Magic Band with a group of younger musicians and regained critical approval through three final albums: Shiny Beast (1978), Doc at the Radar Station (1980) and Ice Cream for Crow (1982). In 1982, he retired from music and pursued a career in art. His abstract expressionist paintings and drawings command high prices, and have been exhibited in art galleries and museums across the world. Early life Van Vliet was born Don Glen Vliet in Glendale, California , on January 15, 1941, to Glen Alonzo Vliet, a service station owner from Kansas , and Willie Sue Vliet ( née Warfield), who was from Arkansas . Van Vliet said that he was descended from adventurer and author Richard Halliburton and related to actor Slim Pickens , and that he remembered being born. Vliet began painting and sculpting at age three. His subjects reflected his \"obsession\" with animals, particularly dinosaurs , fish, African mammals and lemurs . Considered a child prodigy, at age four he was featured with his animal sculptures on a Los Angeles television program. At the age of nine, he won a children's sculpting competition organized for the Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith Park by local tutor and sculptor, Agostinho Rodrigues. During the 1950s, Vliet worked as an apprentice with Rodrigues, who considered him a prodigy. Van Vliet said that he was a lecturer at the Barnsdall Art Institute in Los Angeles at the age of eleven, although it is likely he simply gave a form of artistic dissertation. He said that his parents",

      "text": "Falconer of Artforum concurs, mentioning both a \"neo-primitivist aesthetic\" and stating that his work is influenced by the CoBrA painters. The resemblance to the CoBrA painters is also recognized by art critic Roberto Ohrt, while others have compared his paintings to the work of Jackson Pollock , Franz Kline , Antonin Artaud , Francis Bacon , Vincent van Gogh and Mark Rothko . Dr. John Lane, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , said that, although Van Vliet's work has associations with mainstream abstract expressionist painting, more importantly he was a self-taught artist and his painting \"has that same kind of edge the music has\". Curator David Breuer asserts that, in contrast to the busied, bohemian urban lives of the New York abstract expressionists, the rural desert environment Van Vliet was influenced by is distinctly naturalistic , and that he is a distinguished figure in contemporary art whose work will survive in the canon. Van Vliet stated of his own work, \"I'm trying to turn myself inside out on the canvas. I'm trying to completely bare what I think at that moment\" and \"I paint for the simple reason that I have to. I feel a sense of relief after I do.\" When asked about his artistic influences he stated that there were none. \"I just paint like I paint and that's enough influence.\" He did however state his admiration of Georg Baselitz , Piet Mondrian , and Vincent van Gogh ; after seeing van Gogh's paintings, Van Vliet quoted himself as saying, \"The sun disappoints me so.\" Exhibits of his paintings from the late 1990s were held in New York in 2009 and 2010. He exhibited only few of his paintings because he immediately destroyed any that did not satisfy him. Falconer stated that the exhibitions showed \"evidence of a serious, committed artist\". Publications In 1987, Van Vliet published Skeleton Breath, Scorpion Blush , a collection of his poetry, paintings and drawings. Two books have been published specifically devoted to critique and analysis of his artwork: Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh: On The Arts Of Don Van Vliet (1999) by W. C. Bamberger and Stand Up To Be Discontinued , first published in 1993, a now rare collection of essays on Van Vliet's work. The limited edition version of the book contains a CD of Van Vliet reading six of his poems: Fallin' Ditch , The Tired Plain , Skeleton Makes Good , Safe Sex Drill , Tulip and Gill .

In 2004, Rhino Handmade released in a limited edition of 1,500 copies of Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh . It is a signed and numbered box set containing a CD of Vliet-recited poetry, the Anton Corbijn film of Vliet Some YoYo Stuff on DVD, and two art books produced by Artist Ink Editions. Splinters is a visual \"scrapbook\" of Vliet's life. The second book, eponymously titled, is packed with Vliet's artwork. An onion-skin wallet contains a matching-numbered Vliet lithograph on hand-rolled paper, signed by the artist. Later life and death Van Vliet in Anton Corbijn's 1993 Some Yo Yo Stuff After his retirement from music, Van Vliet rarely appeared in public. He lived near Trinidad, California , with his wife Janet. By the early 1990s, his multiple sclerosis had advanced to the point where he was using a wheelchair. One of Van Vliet's last public appearances was in the 1993 short documentary Some Yo Yo Stuff by filmmaker Anton Corbijn , described as an \"observation of his observations\". Around 13 minutes long and shot entirely in black and white, with an appearance by David Lynch , the film showed a noticeably weakened and dysarthric Van Vliet at home, reading poetry, and philosophically discussing his life, environment, music and art. In 2000, he appeared on Gary Lucas's album Improve the Shining Hour and Moris Tepper's Moth to Mouth , and spoke on Tepper's 2004 song \"Ricochet Man\" from the album Head Off . He is credited for naming Tepper's 2010 album A Singer Named Shotgun Throat . Van Vliet supported environmental issues and causes, particularly those concerned with the welfare of animals; he referred to Earth as \"God's Golfball\". In 2003 he was heard on the compilation album Where We Live: Stand for What You Stand On: A Benefit CD for EarthJustice , singing a version of \" Happy Birthday to You \" retitled \"Happy Earthday\". The track lasts 34 seconds and was recorded over the telephone. Van Vliet died at a hospital in Arcata, California , on Friday, December 17, 2010, of complications from multiple sclerosis. Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan commented on his death, saying he was \"Wondrous, secret ... and profound, he was a diviner of the highest order.\" On the day of his death, Dweezil Zappa dedicated the song \" Willie the Pimp \" to Beefheart at the \" Zappa Plays Zappa \" show at the",

      "text": "Poetry in Motion is a 1982 Canadian documentary film directed by Ron Mann featuring contemporary North American poetry and music. Featured are some of the Black Mountain poets , Beats , minimalist poets , and avant-garde poets. It was released in theaters, later being distributed on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD. An extended CD-ROM version was also released. Production Poetry in Motion is Mann's second feature film after Imagine the Sound . While watching John Giorno and William S. Burroughs at a rock club, Mann discovered Giorno's Dial-A-Poem recordings during a break in the performance. The director later decided to create an anthology of \"post-Beat\" poets for a film. His idea was based on the poem anthology publication The New American Poetry 1945–1960 by Donald Allen . The first poet to say that they were interested in being in the film was Allen Ginsberg . Almost 40 poets performed more than 75 poems, and filmmaker Emile de Antonio helped cut down the filmed material to 90 minutes long. The film is interspersed with parts of an interview with Charles Bukowski . Performers include Allen Ginsberg, Kenward Elmslie , and Anne Waldman . A CD-ROM version was released with poems which were never in the film. All 47 hours of footage are held at the Art Gallery of Ontario . Release The film was originally released in theaters. It was later released on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD. It was released on VHS in 1986 and on DVD in 2002, with an additional hour of content, and a new 8 minute interview with Mann. Reception A review in the book Of-Hollywood Movies says, \"If you aren't a student of contemporary poetry, Poetry in Motion serves as an excellent introduction. If you are, it's orgasmic\". The film has been criticized for including only four Canadian poets, but proponents stated that \"the film is a new genre that elides criticism based in nationalism\".

Biography Kinugasa was born in Kameyama , Mie Prefecture . He began his career as an onnagata (actor specializing in female roles) at the Nikkatsu studio. When Japanese cinema began using actresses in the early 1920s, he switched to directing and worked for producers such as Shozo Makino , before becoming independent to make his best-known film, A Page of Madness (1926). It was considered lost for 45 years until the director rediscovered it in his shed in 1971. A silent film, Kinugasa released it with a new print and score to world acclaim. He also directed the film Crossroads in 1928. He directed jidaigeki at the Shochiku studios, where he helped establish the career of Chōjirō Hayashi (later known as Kazuo Hasegawa ). After the war, he helmed big-budget costume productions for Daiei studios. Gate of Hell received the Palme d'or at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film . On 26 February 1982, Kinugasa died in Kyoto at the age of 86.

After early collaborations with Frank Zappa—vocals on “Willie the Pimp,” co-writing “Muffin Man,” and the shelved 1976 project *Bat Chain Puller*—he rebounded with the acclaimed *Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)*, *Doc at the Radar Station*, and final album *Ice Cream for Crow*, whose video was rejected by MTV yet welcomed by MoMA. Widely cited by Tom Waits, Sonic Youth, the Pixies, Jack White, and many others, Beefheart’s difficult, category-defying music is now viewed as foundational experimental rock and proto-punk.  \n\n**Keywords**:  \nexperimental rock, avant-garde blues, Frank Zappa collaboration, post-punk influence, Trout Mask Replica",

Heavy LSD use, coupled with mounting mental-health issues, eroded Barrett’s reliability—he forgot lyrics, detuned guitars on stage, and stared blankly through TV appearances. By late 1967 the group recruited David Gilmour as auxiliary guitarist; in January 1968 they quietly stopped collecting Barrett for gigs, effectively ending his tenure. Only “Jugband Blues” and a few instrumental contributions survived onto *A Saucerful of Secrets*, marking the transition from Barrett’s whimsical leadership to Waters-led experimentation.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nSyd Barrett, Pink Floyd, psychedelic rock, LSD decline, *Piper at the Gates of Dawn*",
