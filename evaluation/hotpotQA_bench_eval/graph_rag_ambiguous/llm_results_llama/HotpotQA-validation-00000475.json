      "text": "Morning Joe is an American morning news talk show, which airs weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the cable news channel MS NOW . It features former US Representative ( Independent ) Joe Scarborough reporting and discussing the news of the day in a panel format with co-hosts Mika Brzezinski (whom Scarborough married in November 2018), Willie Geist , who regularly co-hosts from Tuesdays to Fridays, and Jonathan Lemire , along with recurring and special guests. History Morning Joe began as a fill-in program after Don Imus ' Imus in the Morning was canceled in April 2007. Former Florida Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough, then host of the primetime MSNBC program Scarborough Country , suggested the idea of doing a morning show instead. He put together what would become Morning Joe with Scarborough Country executive producer Chris Licht and screenwriter John Ridley . The pun in the show's title is echoed by a coffee ring in its logo. On April 16, 2007 (Imus' show aired until April 11, 2007 on MSNBC), the show debuted as one of a series of rotating programs auditioning for Imus's former slot, with Scarborough joined by co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Ridley. Scarborough had personally asked Brzezinski to co-host with him the night before the first audition, while she was a \"cut-in\" presenter during MSNBC's primetime schedule on a freelance basis. Ridley quickly dropped out as main co-host but continued as a regular guest, while Willie Geist was tapped as co-host. The program permanently took over the slot in July 2007, though the decision was not officially announced until October that year. During the first quarter of 2009, Morning Joe earned higher ratings in the age 25-54 demo category than CNN 's competing program, American Morning , but had fewer viewers overall. Both programs finished behind Fox News 's Fox & Friends during the same time period. By March 2010, the show's ratings remained behind those of Fox & Friends , but surpassed its other cable competitors American Morning , Morning Express with Robin Meade , and Squawk Box . Morning Joe continued to regularly place second in total viewers and younger demographic to Fox & Friends , ahead of other cable news competitors including CNN 's New Day . However, Morning Joe ranked behind CNN's counterpart programming during short stints in 2013. Over the years, the program's focus has shifted partly toward enterprise journalism : Scarborough and Brzezinski provide exclusives from the United States Congress , the US State Department , and the White House .  On May 4, 2017, an MSNBC spokesperson confirmed that Scarborough and Brzezinski were engaged to be married. Their style in running the show was then parodied by Saturday Night Live with Kate McKinnon and Alex Moffat . In May 2017, for the first time in",

Their style in running the show was then parodied by Saturday Night Live with Kate McKinnon and Alex Moffat . In May 2017, for the first time in the program's history, Morning Joe attracted an average of over 1 million daily total viewers for the month. In February 2022, MSNBC announced that the show would be extended with a fourth, 9 a.m. hour beginning April 4. The extension replaced Stephanie Ruhle Reports , after she moved to MSNBC's late-night program The 11th Hour to succeed Brian Williams . On March 10, 2022, MSNBC announced that it would offer on-demand episodes of the show, among others on Peacock . In December 2024, it was announced that Way Too Early host Jonathan Lemire would move to the 9 a.m. hour of Morning Joe as a panelist in January 2025, with Ali Vitali succeeding him on Way Too Early . Spinoffs WABC radio edition A radio version debuted in December 2008, carried on WABC in New York City (which was also carrying Imus in the Morning at the time) and other Citadel Media owned and operated stations. Scarborough and Brzezinski hosted this version, called The Joe Scarborough Show , which also replayed highlights from that day's \"Morning Joe\" television show. Scarborough attested that, at least on WABC, the show beat the Glenn Beck Program in the New York City radio market's Arbitron ratings. Despite acceptable ratings, however, the radio version was put on hiatus in April 2010. Scarborough voiced an intention to bring back the show in a revised three-hour version at an undisclosed time in the future. Way Too Early On July 27, 2009, Willie Geist began hosting a new 30-minute show, Way Too Early . It aired on MSNBC at 5:30 a.m. Eastern Time as a lead-in to Morning Joe . Geist left the program in October 2012 when he began co-hosting the third hour of NBC's Today . He is currently a co-host of Morning Joe . The program was revived in September 2020 with Kasie Hunt who left 10 months later for CNN . From October 2021 to December 2024, the program was hosted by Jonathan Lemire , until he moved to Morning Joe's 9 a.m. hour. Since January 6, 2025, the program has been hosted by Ali Vitali . Morning Joe First Look On August 8, 2016, the existing early morning program First Look airing at 5:00 a.m. was expanded into the former timeslot of Way Too Early and retitled Morning Joe First Look , retaining segments from the latter program and presumably to feature some continuity with Morning Joe itself.

      "text": "Charles Joseph Scarborough ( / ˈ s k ɑːr b ʌr oʊ / ; born April 9, 1963) is an American television host and former politician who is the co-host of Morning Joe on MS NOW with his wife Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist . He previously hosted Scarborough Country on the same network. A former member of the Republican Party , Scarborough was in the United States House of Representatives for Florida's 1st district from 1995 to 2001. He was appointed to the President's Council on the 21st Century Workforce in 2002 and was a visiting fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government . He was named in the 2011 Time 100 as one of the most influential people in the world. Early life and education Scarborough was born in Doraville, Georgia in 1963, the son of Mary Joanna ( née Clark) and George Francis Scarborough, a businessman. He has two siblings. In 1969, his family moved to Meridian, Mississippi , in 1973 to Elmira, New York , and in 1978 to Pensacola, Florida . Scarborough attended Pensacola Catholic High School in Pensacola. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of Alabama in 1985 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Florida College of Law in 1990. During this time, he wrote music and produced CDs with his band, Dixon Mills, including the album Calling on Robert E. Lee , and he also coached football and taught high school. During his first year of law school, Scarborough wrote a musical about televangelists called The Gospel According to Esther which premiered at the University of Alabama to positive reviews. Later, the musical was showcased at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival . Legal career Scarborough was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1991 and practiced law in Pensacola . Scarborough's most high-profile case was briefly representing Michael F. Griffin, who murdered Dr. David Gunn in 1993. Griffin's father was a friend of Scarborough's in-laws, and Joe agreed to represent Griffin until the murder suspect found adequate representation. Before removing himself from the case, Scarborough made several court appearances representing Griffin, later saying: \"There was no way in hell I could sit in at a civil trial, let alone a capital trial,\" referring to the prospect of prosecutors seeking the death penalty against Griffin. Scarborough assisted Griffin in choosing other counsel from the many who offered their services, however, and helped shield the family from the media exposure, pro bono . Scarborough's political profile was also raised when he assisted with a petition drive in late-1993, leading a tax revolt that defeated a proposed sixty-five percent increase in Pensacola's property taxes.

      "text": "break. Having known Scarborough for years, Trump would often call into the show during his first presidential campaign. It was also reported that during his term as President, Joe Biden called Scarborough often to get the host’s take on issues, as Morning Joe was Biden’s favorite program, and it influenced who he listened to and how the White House was run. The Monday after the attempted assassination of Trump , MSNBC preempted Morning Joe for the day, prompting threats from Scarborough to quit if the network took similar action again. The Daily Beast reported that the message of the show was “We're back—and the place to go for powerful Democrats to make their case” because in the days following Biden’s endorsement of Vice President Harris for President, Scarborough and others on the show interviewed VP nominee hopefuls Governors Roy Cooper , Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker . The Hollywood Reporter wrote that “at a time when TV news feels like it is fading into irrelevance with the broader public, with a certain group of extremely important and influential viewers (or even one viewer in particular), it appears to be more essential than ever.” In 2022, Scarborough, Brzezinski, and Willie Geist were named Mediaite’s Most Influential in News Media, with Mediaite praising Morning Joe’s “remarkable broadcasting prowess and chemistry.” In 2023, Mediaite recognized the Morning Joe team as the \"clear favorite for liberal viewers and inside-the-Beltway audiences,\" noting Joe Scarborough's role as the \"leading man,\" delivering daily insights into the political zeitgeist with sharp analysis and energy. In 2024, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski were honored as Mediaite’s Most Influential in News Media, celebrated for being among the year’s \"biggest stars in all of media.\" Their show was the most closely tracked program leading up to the presidential election, with viewers recognizing the significant bipartisan influence the hosts wield across the political spectrum. In 2025, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski were ranked No. 2 on Mediaite ’s list, recognizing their “influence in political circles remains enormous and likely unparalleled.” Mediaite cited the duo’s role in shaping the daily political agenda and their ability to attract senior government officials across administrations as central to the program’s sustained relevance and influence in U.S. political discourse. It also highlighted Scarborough’s often newsworthy monologues, Brzezinski’s incisive interviewing style, and the on-air chemistry of the co-hosts, describing the program as “four hours of top-flight morning television.” Awards and honors In 2016, Scarborough was inducted into the Cable Hall of Fame with Mika Brzezinski. In 2017, Harvard awarded Scarborough and Brzezinski a Visiting Fellowship at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics . Scarborough was honored with Brzezinski in 2018 with the Radio Television Digital News Foundation's Leonard Zeidenberg First Amendment Award",

The channel provides 24-hour rolling news coverage focused primarily on the Buffalo metropolitan area and Western New York . The channel is carried on Time Warner Cable systems throughout Western New York on channel 9; it is also carried on TWC's Rochester system on digital channel 1277. A modified feed of the channel, Cable 8 News (C8N), is available on Spectrum's Jamestown system, featuring a mix of local news content and content from Spectrum News 1 Buffalo. As with the rest of its upstate sister news channels in upstate New York , Spectrum News 1 Buffalo shares news content with New York City -based NY1 , Charter's flagship regional cable news channel (which the provider carries on the digital tiers of its Upstate New York systems). As with all Spectrum News channels, Spectrum News 1 Buffalo and C8N are exclusive to Charter Spectrum subscribers; areas of Western New York not served by Charter Spectrum (as of 2017, this includes only a portion of central and southern Cattaraugus County ) cannot access the channel. History The channel was launched at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 25, 2009, as YNN Buffalo . It was initially carried on channel 14 on Time Warner Cable's Buffalo system, before moving to channel 9 in late 2009; YNN also replaced Erie -based NBC affiliate WICU-TV on its Chautauqua County system, local origination channel Time Warner 8 on its Jamestown system and Toronto -based CTV owned-and-operated station CFTO-TV in Toronto on most of its other systems in the region. YNN Buffalo live truck YNN Buffalo was the first regional news channel owned by Time Warner Cable to use the \"YNN\" brand (standing for \"Your News Now\"), which Time Warner Cable would later expand the following month to its Rochester-based news channel R News. On February 12, 2010, the provider announced that it would expand the \"YNN\" brand to two of its other news channels in upstate New York – News 10 Now and Capital News 9 . The \"YNN\" brand later expanded to News 8 Austin in 2011 (although NY1 would never adopt the brand and News 14 Carolina would only use \"Your News Now\" as a slogan and not a branding). In early 2010, YNN Buffalo became the first regional news channel owned by Time Warner Cable to launch a high definition simulcast feed. On December 16, 2013, the channel rebranded as Time Warner Cable News Buffalo as part of a branding standardization across the provider's news channels (meant to make it as obvious as possible that the channel was",

In November 2024, following the 2024 United States presidential election , Mika and Joe met with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago . Public opinions In August 2019, Scarborough drew criticism after posting conspiracy -driven tweets about the death of Jeffrey Epstein , an American financier multimillionaire and convicted sex offender. Scarborough tweeted: \"A guy who had information that would have destroyed rich and powerful men's lives ends up dead in his jail cell. How predictably... Russian.\" In January 2021, Scarborough excoriated the Capitol Hill Police for having enabled the attack at the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump supporters . He claimed a double standard that had the perpetrators been either black or Muslim, they likely would have been dealt with more harshly. Books Scarborough released his first book, Rome Wasn't Burnt in a Day: the Real Deal on how Politicians, Bureaucrats, and other Washington Barbarians are Bankrupting America, on October 4, 2005. In his second book, The Last Best Hope , released on June 9, 2009, Scarborough outlined a plan to help guide conservatives back to a political majority after their defeats in the 2006 midterm elections and the 2008 presidential election .

Crazy Mika,\" while asserting that she was \"bleeding badly from a face-lift\" when he previously encountered her at Mar-a-Lago . The hosts responded with an op-ed in The Washington Post , in which they described White House officials telling them that the president would kill a pending National Enquirer article if they apologized to Trump for their coverage of him. The president's tweets received criticism from many Republican lawmakers, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan , Senators John McCain , Susan Collins , Ben Sasse , Lindsey Graham , and Lisa Murkowski . Trump has also aired \"wild allegations and fact-free innuendo\" stemming from an incident from Scarborough's time in Congress . On July 20, 2001, while Scarborough was in Washington, D.C. , one of his aides, 28 years old, Lori Bolterstein Klausutis, was found dead on the floor of his congressional office in Fort Walton Beach, Florida . An autopsy determined that an undiagnosed heart-valve irregularity had caused the 28-year-old to lose consciousness, fall, and hit her head on the edge of a desk the day before. Media trafficked in speculation about the death, often connecting it with Scarborough's resignation from Congress, announced in May. The claim that Scarborough was involved in the death was promoted by publisher Markos Moulitsas . Since 2017, Trump has resurrected the debunked rumor and has called for another investigation. The Wall Street Journal , New York Post , and Washington Examiner have condemned Trump's remarks. \"It's remarkable that we have a president who is trying to have someone prosecute the person he considers to be his chief critic in the media,\" Scarborough responded in 2020. \"That's what Putin does. That's what Orban does. That's what autocrats have been doing for centuries.\" In May 2020, the aide's widower wrote a letter to Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey begging him to delete Trump's tweets saying \"President Trump on Tuesday tweeted to his nearly 80 million followers alluding to the repeatedly debunked falsehood that my wife was murdered by her boss, former U.S. Rep. Joe Scarborough. The son of the president followed and more directly attacked my wife by tweeting to his followers as the means of spreading this vicious lie.\" Kara Swisher followed up with an op-ed in The New York Times on May 26, 2020, calling on Twitter to hold Trump to the company's rules.

Sponsorship Beginning on June 1, 2009, Morning Joe was presented as \"Brewed by Starbucks \", with the sponsor's logo incorporated into the show's logo. Although the hosts previously consumed Starbucks coffee on air \"for free\", in the words of the network's president Phil Griffin , it was not paid placement at that time. The Starbucks sponsorship of Morning Joe ended in 2013. Feud with Jon Stewart On June 3, 2009, The Daily Show host Jon Stewart mocked the Starbucks sponsorship of the program, showing several clips of the Morning Joe cast prominently displaying and complimenting Starbucks products as well as an interview with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz . Scarborough responded that his intent in discussing the sponsorship was sarcastic and he suggested that Stewart and his \"90 writers\" did not understand the joke. On June 8, Stewart feigned embarrassment over missing their alleged sarcasm, claiming, \"At the time, I thought your jokey manner was just a way of sublimating your shame over the discomfort you feel deep in your soul after extinguishing the last smoldering embers of any of your program's journalistic bona fides. But now, I realize that that wasn't the case!\" On June 9, Scarborough fired back, referring to Stewart as \"a very, very angry guy with a Napoleonic complex \". The next day, Stewart and correspondent John Oliver again responded with a skit, involving Stewart impersonating Napoleon and Oliver impersonating an even shorter Arthur Wellesley , Duke of Wellington. After the routine, Stewart joked that he hoped that this would be the end of the feud, since continuing it was becoming expensive for the show. Clash with Rush Limbaugh During the Obama administration , Joe Scarborough sought to distance himself from certain elements in the Republican Party . He criticized Republicans such as Rush Limbaugh who celebrated President Obama's failed bid to bring the 2016 Olympics to Chicago saying that \"Republicans have gone off the deep end.\" On the October 8, 2009 edition of his radio show, Limbaugh fired back by saying that Scarborough was \"doing his best impression of [...] a neutered chickified moderate\". Scarborough responded the next day on Morning Joe , faulting Limbaugh for uncritical loyalty to George W. Bush during the president's tenure in office. Scarborough specifically said that Limbaugh had put his \"testicles in a blind trust for George W. Bush for eight years\".
