Moonstruck had a limited theatrical release in the United States on December 18, 1987, followed by a wide release on January 15, 1988, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . The film earned critical and commercial success. It received six nominations at the 60th Academy Awards , winning three for Best Actress (Cher), Best Supporting Actress (Dukakis), and Best Original Screenplay (Shanley). Plot Loretta Castorini, an Italian-American widow, works as a bookkeeper and lives in Brooklyn Heights with her parents, Cosmo and Rose, and her paternal grandfather. Loretta's boyfriend, Johnny Cammareri, proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to tend to his dying mother. Loretta accepts, but she insists on carefully following tradition as she believes failing to do so originally led to her first husband's sudden death after two years of marriage. Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny to the wedding; Ronny and Johnny have not spoken in five years. Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement. Cosmo, who runs a successful plumbing business, dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to pay for Loretta's planned \"real\" wedding. Hearing that Loretta likes but does not love Johnny, Rose tells her that true love can cause romantic partners to be easily hurt by each other. Loretta goes to see Ronny at the bakery he owns and learns Ronny has a wooden prosthetic hand caused by absentmindedly putting his hand in a bread slicer while having a conversation with Johnny; Ronny's fiancée subsequently left him. Loretta insists that they talk privately. They go to Ronny's apartment, where Loretta cooks a meal, and both have several alcoholic beverages. Loretta compares Ronny to a wolf that would gnaw off its paw to escape a trap and claims he deliberately injured his hand to escape a bad relationship. Ronny reacts furiously and passionately, kissing Loretta; to her surprise, Loretta kisses him back. Ronny carries Loretta to his bed, where they have sex. That evening, Rose's brother Raymond and his wife Rita join Rose, Cosmo, and Cosmo’s father for dinner and they wonder where Loretta is. Raymond recalls a particularly bright moon that he believes was in the sky when Cosmo was courting Rose, which Loretta and Ronny witness as well.

She has also appeared in one starring theater role, one video game role, numerous television commercials and directed a piece of the motion picture If These Walls Could Talk in 1996 and some of her music videos of the Geffen-era in late 1980s and in early 1990s. Cher has starred in various international television commercials, as well as high-profile print advertising for Lori Davis (1992). Before she started her film career, she had a couple of hits in the 1960s, as a solo artist, and with her ex-husband Sonny Bono as the couple Sonny & Cher . Her first appearance as an actress was in 1967 in the American television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. as the model Ramona. That same year, she started her film career with Sonny Bono in the poorly received-film Good Times and later as a solo actress in the low budget feature Chastity . Since then she has starred in numerous independent and Hollywood motion pictures. She made her Broadway debut in Robert Altman 's Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean in 1982. The play was a critical and commercial success and Cher received strong reviews for her stage work (even Frank Rich called her \"ingratiating\" ) and paved the way for her to be cast in the film version the next year, that garnered her a Golden Globe nomination. She was next cast alongside Meryl Streep and Kurt Russell in the critically hailed drama Silkwood (1983) directed by Mike Nichols , inspired by the true-life story of Karen Silkwood , in which her character was a lesbian who worked at the Kerr-McGee plant in Cimarron, Oklahoma . It was a commercial success and grossed $35 million in the United States alone. Cher then appeared in the drama Mask (1985) directed by Peter Bogdanovich and with Eric Stoltz , Sam Elliott and Laura Dern . The film is based on the life and early death of Roy L. \"Rocky\" Dennis , a boy who suffered from craniodiaphyseal dysplasia . The film was considered her first critical and commercial success as a leading actress and firmly established her as an actress. For her role as a mother of a severely disfigured boy, Cher won the Best Actress prize at the Cannes Film Festival . In 1987, she starred in three films: the thriller Suspect , with Dennis Quaid and Liam Neeson ; the film has been credited for the high quality of acting despite the severe loopholes of the story. In particular, Cher, in the lead role, has received positive reviews. The fantasy film The Witches of Eastwick , with Jack Nicholson , Susan Sarandon and Michelle",

There may be no such thing as the sweet life. But it is necessary to find that out for yourself. Preferences Favorites In an essay looking back at his first 25 years as a film critic, Ebert wrote: If I had to make a generalization, I would say that many of my favorite movies are about Good People ... Casablanca is about people who do the right thing. The Third Man is about people who do the right thing and can never speak to one another as a result ... Not all good movies are about Good People. I also like movies about bad people who have a sense of humor. Orson Welles , who does not play either of the good people in The Third Man , has such a winning way, such witty dialogue, that for a scene or two we almost forgive him his crimes. Henry Hill, the hero of Goodfellas , is not a good fella, but he has the ability to be honest with us about why he enjoyed being bad. He is not a hypocrite. Of the other movies I love, some are simply about the joy of physical movement. When Gene Kelly splashes through Singin' in the Rain , when Judy Garland follows the yellow brick road, when Fred Astaire dances on the ceiling, when John Wayne puts the reins in his teeth and gallops across the mountain meadow, there is a purity and joy that cannot be resisted. In Equinox Flower , a Japanese film by the old master Yasujirō Ozu , there is this sequence of shots: A room with a red teapot in the foreground. Another view of the room. The mother folding clothes. A shot down a corridor with a mother crossing it at an angle, and then a daughter crossing at the back. A reverse shot in the hallway as the arriving father is greeted by the mother and daughter. A shot as the father leaves the frame, then the mother, then the daughter. A shot as the mother and father enter the room, as in the background the daughter picks up the red pot and leaves the frame. This sequence of timed movement and cutting is as perfect as any music ever written, any dance, any poem. Ebert credits film historian Donald Richie and the Hawaii International Film Festival for introducing him to Asian cinema through Richie's invitation to join him on the jury of the festival in 1983, which quickly became a favorite of his and would frequently attend along with Richie, lending their support to validate the festival's status as a \"festival of record\". He lamented the decline of campus film societies: \"There was once a time when young people made it their business to catch up on the best works by the best directors, but the death of film societies and repertory theaters put an end to",

      "text": "Two Weeks Notice is a 2002 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Marc Lawrence and starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant , with Alicia Witt , Dana Ivey , Robert Klein , and Heather Burns in supporting roles. In the film, an idealistic, liberal lawyer (Bullock) goes to work for a narcissistic, billionaire developer (Grant) and they form an unlikely pair. The film was released in the United States on December 20, 2002, by Warner Bros. Pictures . It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $199 million worldwide. Plot The \"Coney Island community center\" Lucy wants to preserve was actually the Childs Restaurant location on Coney Island 's Riegelmann Boardwalk . It was declared a New York Landmark a month after the film's premiere. It closed later (as in this 2013 picture) and, after renovation, became part of the Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island . Lucy Kelson is an intelligent, highly competent liberal lawyer who specializes in historic preservation, environmental law, and pro bono cases in New York City . George Wade is an arrogant, needy billionaire real estate developer and stylish playboy, who is also quite naïve. Lucy's hard work and devotion to others contrasts sharply with George's childish recklessness and greed. Lucy meets George in an attempt to stop the destruction of the Coney Island community center from her childhood. Learning that she graduated from the prestigious Harvard Law School , he asks to hire her to replace his old Chief Counsel, overlooking their opposing views of real estate development. She decides the benefits he offers in discretionary funding for causes she supports outweigh the negatives, especially as he promises to protect the community center. Lucy finds what George really requires is advice in all aspects of his life. She regretfully becomes his indispensable assistant and he calls her for every little thing at all hours. After Lucy is disrupted at a friend's wedding by George's latest \"emergency\" (what to wear to an event he is attending), she gives him two weeks' notice of resignation . Lucy looks for work at other firms, but George has called in advance asking them not to hire her, so he can keep her on. Eventually, he admits defeat and she offers to help him find a replacement, unconscious of how close and interdependent they have become. They act like an old married couple at a restaurant, able to simultaneously carry out a conversation while involuntarily exchanging food out of habit from knowing each other's food preferences. When potential interviewee June Carver shows up without an appointment seeking a position, Lucy speaks to her, but says she is concerned she lacks real estate experience. When George sees June, he is immediately attracted and is ready to hire her on the spot, seemingly disregarding Lucy's concerns. Lucy becomes increasingly competitive with her replacement. When George invites June to business events that Lucy would normally go on, she acts increasingly jealous. Lucy learns that despite George's promise,",

Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.\" He wrote that Mad Dog Time \"is the first movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time. Oh, I've seen bad movies before. But they usually made me care about how bad they were. Watching Mad Dog Time is like waiting for the bus in a city where you're not sure they have a bus line\" and concluded that the film \"should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor.\" Of Caligula , he wrote \"It is not good art, it is not good cinema, and it is not good porn\" and approvingly quoted the woman in front of him at the drinking fountain, who called it \"the worst piece of shit I have ever seen.\" Ebert's reviews were also characterized by \"dry wit.\" He often wrote in a deadpan style when discussing a movie's flaws; in his review of Jaws: The Revenge , he wrote that Mrs. Brody's \"friends pooh-pooh the notion that a shark could identify, follow or even care about one individual human being, but I am willing to grant the point, for the benefit of the plot. I believe that the shark wants revenge against Mrs. Brody. I do. I really do believe it. After all, her husband was one of the men who hunted this shark and killed it, blowing it to bits. And what shark wouldn't want revenge against the survivors of the men who killed it? Here are some things, however, that I do not believe\", going on to list the other ways the film strained credulity. He wrote \" Pearl Harbor is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle. Its centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality. The film has been directed without grace, vision, or originality, and although you may walk out quoting lines of dialog, it will not be because you admire them.\" \"[Ebert's prose] had a plain-spoken Midwestern clarity...a genial, conversational presence on the page...his criticism shows a nearly unequaled grasp of film history and technique, and formidable intellectual range, but he rarely seems to be showing off. He's just trying to tell you what he thinks, and to provoke some thought on your part about how movies work and what they can do\". — A.O. Scott",

Executives spent extra on a campaign that branded the film the season’s “romantic alternative,” targeting female audiences and avoiding over-saturation. Sneak previews in 750 theaters reached 80 % capacity, strong word-of-mouth was cultivated through niche screenings, and the strategy paid off: the movie became the summer’s sleeper hit despite facing roughly 60 competing releases.\n\n**Keywords**: counter-programming, summer release, romantic comedy, sleeper hit, TriStar marketing",

Personal favorites—*Citizen Kane*, *La Dolce Vita*, *The Third Man*—reflected his admiration for morally complex, humanistic storytelling.
