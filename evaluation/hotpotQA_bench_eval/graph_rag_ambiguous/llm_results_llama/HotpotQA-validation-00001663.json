      "text": "The Volvo S40 is a series of subcompact executive cars marketed and produced by the Swedish manufacturer Volvo Cars from 1995 to 2012, offered as a more mainstream alternative to the compact executive Volvo 850 and later the Volvo S60 to compete in a lower pricing bracket. The S40 was more or less positioned against premium-leaning small family cars like the Volkswagen Jetta , as well as some mass-market large family cars . The first generation (1995–2004) was introduced in 1995 with the S40 (S from saloon) and V40 (V from versatility, estate) cars. The second generation was released in 2003, and the estate variant became differentiated from the sedan, having its name changed to V50 . The range was replaced by the Volvo V40 five door hatchback in 2012. First generation (1995–2004) During August 1995, Volvo released its new series, intending to call the cars S4 and F4. However, as Audi had already reserved the \"S4\" name, Volvo opted to name the range S40 (saloon), and V40 (estate). These cars were manufactured at the Nedcar factory at Born in the Netherlands (a pre Ford joint venture between Volvo and Mitsubishi Motors ) and based on a common platform with the Mitsubishi Carisma , later used by the Proton Waja . They were also the last Volvos to be produced at the Born plant; a lineage that had begun in the early 1970s with Volvo's collaboration with DAF that had led to the Volvo 66 and the Volvo 300 series . In the United Kingdom, it costs approximately 50% more than the related Mitsubishi Carisma. The car helped change perceptions of Volvo: \"The S40/V40 range was the car that finally persuaded buyers that Volvo really could build a credible compact executive car\", reported the RAC. For the 2000 model year, Volvo expanded the S40/V40's market to North America, where this range went on sale exclusively with the 1.9 liter turbo. The V40, with a drag coefficient of 0.32, was the first whole model to be introduced under the direction of the British designer Peter Horbury , Volvo’s design director and was marketed in Australia, South America and the Far East. The V40 was named the \"Most Beautiful Estate Car in the World\" at an Italian award ceremony. The official premiere was at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1995, with the V40 premiering in December 1995, at the Bologna Motor Show . In July 2000, Volvo updated the 40 Series (\"Phase II\"), implementing several technical improvements, including improved engine management, diesel direct fuel injection, extra safety features, larger brake discs, new front suspension and steering, revised rear suspension, larger tyres and a wider track. A minor facelift gave more streamlining, slightly different front wings",

Powered by inline-four and straight-five engines , the C30 is a variant of the Volvo S40/V50 / C70 range, sharing the same Ford C1/Volvo P1 platform. Volvo marketed the C30 as a premium hatchback / sports coupe . The C30's rear styling and frameless glass rear hatch recall Volvo's earlier P1800 ES and Volvo 480 . Pre-production concepts Volvo SCC (2001) The Volvo SCC (Safety Concept Car) is a concept vehicle incorporating the rear hatch design from the Volvo P1800ES and the glass hatch from Volvo 480ES . Its safety features included forward collision warning , blind spot monitor and alert, lane departure warning , adaptive cruise control , flashing brake lights during hard braking, and headlights that follow the curvature of the road as the car turns. Many of these features would become commonplace years later. The SCC also featured a head-up display and communication with the car via mobile phone. The SCC was first unveiled at the 2001 Detroit Auto Show , then in autumn 2001 at the Seville International Airport in southern Spain. Research to adapt its safety features for production began in 2002, and it led to development of the C30 which began in 2003. 2006 SEMA concepts (2006) Side view of the IPD SEMA concept Detail on the nitrous tanks The Evolve C30 show car has a twin turbo engine, all wheel drive, suspension from Evolve's 2004 S40 concept from the 2004 SEMA show, and 4-piston brake calipers.

Production ended in May 2012. The updated 2.0 and T5 and the new D2, D3 and D4 are compliant with the Euro 5 emission standard (the rest are Euro 4 compliant), and the DRIVe included a start-stop system for reduced fuel consumption and emissions.

A minor facelift gave more streamlining, slightly different front wings and front bumper, and larger front indicators, as well as minor instruments and fascia redesign. In late 2002, there was a subtle update to the range. On the outside, there was a new \"egg crate\" style grille and colour-keyed trim mouldings. Inside, there was a three-spoke steering wheel and new instruments with four dials. Other changes include improved fuel economy, new side-impact curtain airbags, updated seats and a new key with integrated remote. The 40 Series cars were equipped with four-cylinder engines, such as a Renault-sourced 1.9 turbo diesel or 1.6 (1587 cc), 1.8 (1731 cc, later increased to 1783 cc  ), 2.0T (1948 cc), 1.9 T4 (1855 cc, later increased to 1948 cc) or 2.0 (1948 cc) fuel injected gasoline engines. All of the gasoline engines are derivatives of the Volvo Modular series , which started life in the Volvo 960 and was seen in both 5 and 6 cylinder layouts in Volvo's bigger FWD cars. There was also a 1.8 L (1834 cc) petrol direct injection engine provided by Mitsubishi as part of the platform sharing between the 40 series and the Carisma. The Volvo S40/V40 series was a completely new car from the ground up, only one engine – the 1.9 turbo diesel – carried over from the old 400 Series. The low (2.0T) and high (1.9 T4) pressure turbo variants were positioned at the top of the motor range. The 2.0T was rounded down and badged as a 1.9T and was the only engine available in North America. The five speed manual transmission, widely available in Europe, was not certified in North American S40s, with the five speed automatic as the only option. No electric CVT was planned, unlike the 440 HTA / High Tech Auto CVT that had been released before the 400 series was completely phased out. In the United Kingdom, trim levels were S, XS, SE and CD. Later on, trim levels offered were supplemented with SE Lux and Sport Lux trim designations. A limited edition 'Xi' trim level was also offered for a short run on Phase 1 and Phase 1.5 cars, often painted yellow with black bezel headlamps.

      "text": "The Honda S660 is a sports car in the kei class manufactured by the Japanese company Honda from 2015 until 2022. It is a two-seater with a targa top and a transverse mid-engine and rear-wheel-drive layout . It is the successor to the Honda Beat (with regard to segment), and the Honda S2000 (with regard to nomenclature, as it also belongs to Honda's family of \"S\" models ). Overview The S660 is a lightweight mid-engined roadster with a targa roof. Its dimensions, due to kei car size restrictions, are nearly identical to the 1990s Beat . It is sold with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed CVT with sports paddle shifters, both options being offered on the two trims available (Alpha and Beta). The S660 weighs approximately 830 kg with the manual transmission and 850 kg with the CVT, and have a front/rear weight balance of 45/55. The naming convention of using the letter \"S\" followed by the engine displacement is a long-held Honda tradition going back to Honda's second production car, the Honda S500 (from which the S660 draws inspiration). Performance The S660 is powered by the same turbocharged 658 cc S07A Turbo engine used in the N-One with some minor mechanical improvements. In the S660, this engine is mid-mounted and produces 64 PS (47 kW; 63 hp) at 6,000 rpm and 104 N⋅m (77 lb⋅ft) of torque at 2,600 rpm with a redline of 7,700 rpm for the manual transmission and 7,000 rpm for the CVT. Development and launch The Honda S660 Concept The development team of the S660 was led by Ryo Mukumoto, who beat out 400 other participants in Honda's in-house competition at the age of 22. Honda made him the youngest lead engineer in the company's history in spite of his lack of engineering experience, and he was given 5 years to develop the S660. The exterior design is based on the Honda EV-STER, unveiled at the 42nd Tokyo Motor Show in 2011 as a \"next-generation electric small sports concept model.\" It has been redesigned for a kei car, and is inspired by the Honda S660 CONCEPT. A prototype was shown at the November 2013 Tokyo Motor Show . The prototype and proposed production announcement were widely covered in auto enthusiast news sites and blogs. Initial reactions to the concept were favorable. First photographs The prototype S660 was photographed by car enthusiasts at a wintertime car event in early 2015 and published in the Japanese car enthusiast magazine Mag-X , and subsequently republished in the US car blog The Truth About Cars . The pictures included several exterior photos and one of the opened engine compartments. Production Honda S660 released on",

Modifications included the removal of passenger amenities, main deck structural reinforcement, addition of cargo handling flooring, and the installation of a 757-200PF port-side cargo door in the forward fuselage. The forward two entry doors and lobby area of the passenger aircraft are retained, resulting in a main deck cargo capacity of 14 full sized pallets and one smaller LD3 . Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo such as racehorses, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft to facilitate animal handlers. ST Aerospace continued to offer 14, 14.5 and 15 Unit load device variants of the SF in 2020. In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6 billion (~$3.88 billion in 2024) plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet, citing a 25% reduction in operating cost along with noise benefits. The 757-200PCF is another passenger to freighter conversion developed by Precision Conversions, and was certificated in 2005. In 2019, the conversion was reported to cost $5 million (~$6.03 million in 2024) per aircraft, and has 15 pallet positions just like the SF. The forward passenger doors are removed and replaced with a small crew door, similar to the -200PF.

Also known as the 757-200CB (Combi), the type retains the passenger windows and cabin doors of the 757-200, while adding a forward port-side cargo door in the manner of the 757-200PF. Kathmandu-based Royal Nepal Airlines, later renamed Nepal Airlines , included the convertible model as part of an order for two 757s in 1986.

The episode was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by Chris Koch . Plot Claire ( Julie Bowen ) drives Alex ( Ariel Winter ) and Haley ( Sarah Hyland ) to school and while she does, she accidentally hits Phil ( Ty Burrell ) with the car. Phil gets up and continue walking saying he is OK but Claire is determined to get a stop sign at the intersection because it is dangerous not having one. She starts petition the city and goes door-to-door to get the signatures she needs but she does not get a very positive reaction from the neighbors. She asks for her family's help but everyone is busy with their own (meaningful) things, something that causes Claire's angry reaction. Claire goes to the city councilman ( David Cross ) to discuss her proposal and everyone comes to help her after feeling guilty for not doing it from the start. Alex and Haley got the extra signatures Claire needed and Phil made a video with Luke ( Nolan Gould ) to prove that not having a stop sign to that intersection is dangerous. In the meantime, Jay ( Ed O'Neill ) is determined to help Manny ( Rico Rodriguez ) sell wrapping paper for a school fundraiser and he goes door-to-door with him to teach him how to do it. Manny, however, is not a natural salesman, and after many failed tries, he manipulates Jay to buy the wrapping paper. Meanwhile, Mitchell ( Jesse Tyler Ferguson ) tries to prove a point with Cameron ( Eric Stonestreet ). Cameron wants to cook some crepes and Mitchell tells him that he is the one who always ending up cleaning the mess in the kitchen every time Cam gets creative. Cam promises to clean up when he is done but instead of this he goes out to help Gloria ( Sofía Vergara ) who is desperate to find Stella ( Brigitte ) after losing her. Mitchell comes back home and when he sees the mess he tells Cam that he will not clean up and let him do it as he promised. Cam comes home and sees that Mitchell indeed keep his promise not to do anything, despite hoping for the opposite, and when he starts cleaning he admits that he does not like doing it and he expected Mitch to do it. Mitch is happy that he was proved right and the two of them revel in further mess-making until the doorbell rings and reveals a representative from the adoption agency coming for a home-visit. Production \"Door to Door\" was written by executive producer Bill Wrubel and was directed by Chris Koch . \"Door to Door\" was filmed between August 29 and September 1, 2011.

Volvo S40 parked next to Volvo V50 , the station wagon variant Engines Marketing Volvo launched an advertising campaign for the S40 titled The Mystery of Dalarö, using a documentary style video approach. The eight minute film was credited to fictitious Venezuelan film maker Carlos Soto. In fact, as was disclosed later, it was directed by Spike Jonze . The film is set on 25 October 2003, where 32 people supposedly purchased a Volvo S40, at the same local Volvo dealership in Dalarö , a small village to the south east of Stockholm . In addition to this film, a four minute documentary of the documentary, calling into question the validity of the events, was posted as Soto's \"personal edit\" on his alleged homepage. The S40 was the first Volvo car to be launched in China by the brand under the Changan Ford Mazda joint venture and commenced production in March 2006.
