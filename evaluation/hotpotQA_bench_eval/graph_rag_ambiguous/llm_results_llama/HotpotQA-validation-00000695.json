She announced the shows at \"the home of football\" by singing the England football team's \" Three Lions \" anthem and also the theme song to the BBC's weekly Premier League football show Match of the Day . Adele had added another two concerts at Wembley after the first two dates sold out, however she cancelled the last two dates of the tour after damaging her vocal cords. As a show of support, fans instead gathered outside Wembley Stadium to perform renditions of her songs, in an event titled \"Sing for Adele\". At the end of 2016, Billboard named Adele Artist of the Year for the third time, and also received the Top Billboard 200 album. 25 was the best-selling album for a second consecutive year in the US. With 235 million views, Adele's Carpool Karaoke through the streets of London with James Corden , a sketch which featured on Corden's talk show The Late Late Show with James Corden in January 2016, was the biggest YouTube viral video of 2016. At the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2017, Adele won all five of her nominations, bringing her number of awards to fifteen. She won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for 25 , and Record of the Year , Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Hello\".

The message ended with, \"30 will be a drum n bass record to spite you\". Media outlets took the post as an indication that a new album was on the way. On 15 February 2020, Adele announced at a friend's wedding that her fourth studio album would be out by September 2020. However, she later confirmed that the album's production and release had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

Turn of the millennium On August 24, 1990, Irish pop singer Sinéad O'Connor threatened to boycott her scheduled performance that night at the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel Township, New Jersey , if the U.S. national anthem were played. In her own words, she explained, I sincerely harbor no disrespect for America or Americans, but I have a policy of not having any national anthems played before my concerts in any country, including my own , because they have nothing to do with music in general ... I am concerned though, because today, we're seeing other artists arrested at their own concerts ... There is a disturbing trend towards censorship of music and art in this country and people should be alarmed over that far more than my actions ... The Center gave in to her demands, but not without controversy. Frank Sinatra criticized her the following evening while performing at the same venue, stating that he wished that he could \"kick her in the ass.\" New York state Senator Nicholas Spano urged people to boycott O'Connor's subsequent show in Saratoga , saying \"I'm sure Ms. O'Connor would be the first to complain if someone tried to censor her performance, yet she is trying to censor the national anthem by refusing to perform where it is played.\" In the NBA in 1996, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf , guard for the Denver Nuggets , refused to stand during the anthem before games in protest of anti-Islamic rhetoric. He was suspended for his actions and received hostile responses and death threats. It was noted at the same time that the Seattle SuperSonics ’ Sam Perkins , a Jehovah's Witness , stood apart from his teammates during the national anthem. George Shinn , owner of the Charlotte Hornets , threatened to trade any player who refused to stand. After his suspension, Abdul-Rauf stood, but with his head bowed in silent prayer. In 2003, two women's basketball players, Toni Smith of Manhattanville College and Deidra Chatman of the University of Virginia , made headlines for refusing to face the flag during the national anthem. Chatman protested for one game in March 2003 due to her anti-war views in light of the then-ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Iraq . Smith, who had been boycotting the anthem all season long before being finally noticed in February 2003, said that she was also protesting the United States' involvement in Iraq, as well as a growing disparity between the rich and the poor. During one of her team's games on February 23, 2003, a fan named Jerry Kiley, a self-described Vietnam veteran, ran onto the court and confronted her with an American flag, saying, \"She has not earned the right to disrespect the flag.\" In 2004, Carlos Delgado of the Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball team decided he would no longer stand during the song, \"God Bless",

At the 2013 Grammy Awards, she confirmed that she was in the very early stages of her third album. She also stated that she will most likely work with Paul Epworth again.

The message, \"Bye bye 25... See you again later in the year,\" was interpreted by some in the media, including Capital FM , as meaning that her next album would be titled 25 and released later in the year.

Five years later, he would write and perform \" Another Way to Die \" with Alicia Keys as the theme for the 2008 Bond film Quantum of Solace . \"Seven Nation Army\" was produced by Jack and recorded at Toe Rag Studios in London's Hackney area. He wrote the song as a \"little experiment\", hoping to create a compelling song that did not include a chorus. The lyrics were written the night before the song was recorded. The title \"Seven Nation Army\" was initially used as a placeholder for the track before its lyrics were written, but the name ultimately stuck. Composition \"Seven Nation Army\" 15-second sample featuring the song's driving riff, drumbeat, and opening lyrics Problems playing this file? See media help . \"Seven Nation Army\" is characterized as an alternative rock , garage rock , blues rock and punk blues song with a length of three minutes and 52 seconds. According to sheet music published by Universal Music Publishing Group , it is composed in the key of E minor in common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. The title of the song comes from when Jack, as a young child in Detroit, misheard \"The Salvation Army \" as \"The Seven Nation Army\". A DigiTech Whammy was used to create the bass-like sound heard in the driving riff. The song is driven by a riff that resembles the sound of a bass guitar. To create this sound, Jack connected a semi-acoustic guitar to a DigiTech Whammy pedal (a pitch shift effect), lowering the pitch by an octave . The riff uses five pitches and consists of seven notes; it begins with a held note followed by four syncopated notes, ending with two notes that appear frequently in laments . The 7-note riff of \"Seven Nation Army\" has been noted to be similar to the main theme (movements 1 and 4) of Bruckner's 5th symphony . The song also features distorted vocals and a \"heartbeat drum\", played by White Stripes drummer Meg White . AllMusic 's Tom Maginnis noted that the song \"manipulat[es] the power of tension and release\": it creates a sense of \"anticipatory energy\", then transitions into what Maginnis described as a \"[wordless] crush of what stands for the chorus\", consisting of an electric guitar and a \"bashing crash cymbal\". John Mulvey of NME described \"Seven Nation Army\" as a \"diatribe against fame\". The song's lyrics were inspired by the growing attention received by the White Stripes. According to Jack, the song tells the story of a person who, upon entering a town, hears its residents gossiping about him and proceeds to leave the town in response. Driven by a sense of loneliness, he ultimately returns. Regarding the song's",

It was released on July 12, 2011. The album's lead single is \" Adolescents \" and it was posted on the band's website on April 4, 2011. On April 28, 2011, Incubus premiered the video for \"Adolescents\" and also released a video with behind the scenes footage. The band revealed that they would tour for 18 months following the release of the record. Ben Kenney live in Rock in Rio Madrid 2012 To promote the release of If Not Now, When? , the band took part in a participatory media exhibit and real-time documentary called Incubus HQ Live that allowed unprecedented fan access and interaction. Footage, music and art from the seven-day event became available as a special edition box set in July 2012. Mike has said that he is writing music for an orchestral project and also for Incubus. He states in a video (Mikey Gear Tour part II), \"My hope is to just write lots of music and then by the time we get to the point to where we're going to finish the tour I'll have a lot of music written and then people won't have to wait five more years for another album (laughs).\" The band joined Linkin Park as co-headliners on the 2012 edition of the Honda Civic Tour . Incubus hinted that they would go on hiatus following the end of the 2012 Honda Civic Tour , but their manager stated that Incubus would only take a break after the tour, not a hiatus. In October 2012, the band released their second compilation album. The album, entitled The Essential Incubus , included songs spanning the band's major label career, from 1997's Enjoy Incubus EP to 2011's If Not Now, When? .

Critical reception \"Seven Nation Army\" received widespread critical acclaim. Heather Phares of AllMusic described it as a \"breathtaking opener\" to the album Elephant , and Bram Teltelman of Billboard suggested that \"adventurous rock programmers might want to join the 'Army ' \". In particular, \"Seven Nation Army \" 's central riff has been the subject of praise since the song's release. A writer for Rolling Stone described it as the best riff of the 2000s decade, and Rebecca Schiller of NME wrote that the riff is \"the most maddeningly compulsive bassline of the decade, and not even actually played on a bass guitar\". Critics also praised Meg's drumming—a \"hypnotic thud\" according to Tom Maginnis of AllMusic . Teltelman described the drumming as \"simple but effective\", and Phares said it was \"explosively minimal\". Critics also distinguished the song from the White Stripes' other work. According to Teltelman, \"Seven Nation Army\" represented an effort to \"defy categorization\", especially the garage rock label that had been attributed to the band. He further wrote that it was \"much more of a straightforward rock song\" than the band's 2002 single \" Fell in Love with a Girl \". Phares found \"Seven Nation Army\" to \"deliver some of the fiercest blues-punk\" of any song by the White Stripes. \"Seven Nation Army\" won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in addition to being nominated for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal . In 2003, it was ranked number three on Pazz & Jop based on music critics' votes, and listed as the number-one song of the year on the 2003 KROQ Top 106.7 . Consequence of Sound , Paste and Stereogum all named \"Seven Nation Army\" as the White Stripes' best song. Critics ranked \"Seven Nation Army\" among the best tracks of the 2000s decade; it appeared on NME ' s, Rolling Stone ' s, WFNX 's, and Pitchfork ' s retrospective lists, and it was placed at number one on Consequence of Sound ' s \"Top 50 Songs of the Decade\". Commercial performance On March 8, 2003, \"Seven Nation Army\" debuted at number 27 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart; on July 26, it peaked at number one, a position it maintained for three weeks.

The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after San Francisco 49ers quarterback (QB) Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016 . At first, Kaepernick's quiet demonstrations went unnoticed until a former Army Green Beret named Nate Boyer suggested the quarterback kneel as a more respectful sign toward veterans, which is exactly what made Kaepernick stand out. People started to notice a kneeling player, rather than one who was hidden behind standing players while he sat on the bench. The protests have generated mixed reactions and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues. Shortly after, his demonstrations spread nationwide to sports on every level, including college football and volleyball, high school football, a Texas youth football team, along with Major League Baseball's (MLB) Oakland A's, the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the U.S. national women's soccer team. Stemming from the Kaepernick controversy, before the beginning of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey tournament in Toronto, Canada , Team USA coach John Tortorella told in an interview that if any one of his players were to sit out during the anthem, they would sit on the bench for the entire duration of the game. By the time the first Sunday of the regular season started in September 2016, several other players starting taking part in Kaepernick's protests, including: his teammate Eric Reid, Seattle Seahawks' Jeremy Lane, Denver Broncos' Brandon Marshall (who lost three endorsement deals for his actions), four Miami Dolphins players, Kansas City Chief's Marcus Peters, and New England Patriots' Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty. When various players first took part in these acts, the NFL came out with a statement saying that individual teams would receive a fine if its players sat or knelt during the anthem. Kaepernick's Twitter and Instagram platforms were soon filled with acknowledgements about the racial injustice and brutality against young African American men. He publicized his reasoning for why he chose to kneel during the National Anthem. As the protests continued, Colin Kaepernick, the man who started the protests, was featured on the October cover of Time Magazine for stirring up conversations regarding his movement. In September 2018, Nike made Kaepernick the face of its campaign- Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything- which promoted debate over his protests and boycotts against Nike.

Driven by a sense of loneliness, he ultimately returns. Regarding the song's meaning, Jack stated, \"The song's about gossip. It's about me, Meg and the people we're dating.\" Maginnis described the lyrics as presenting an \"obstinate attitude\", citing the first verse: \"I'm gonna fight 'em off / A seven nation army couldn't hold me back / They're gonna rip it off / Taking their time right behind my back\". In regards to the line \"I'm going to Wichita / Far from this opera forevermore\", Jack said he has never visited the city, but was using it as metaphor and getting himself into character for the song with the lyric. Release Jack's idea of releasing \"Seven Nation Army\" as a single faced opposition from the White Stripes' record label, XL Recordings, which wanted to release the song \" There's No Home for You Here \" instead. Jack persuaded the label to release \"Seven Nation Army\", and in 2003 it was released as a promotional single alongside Elephant track \" In the Cold, Cold Night \". It was subsequently released in 2013 as a 7-inch vinyl single and a CD single; the former included a cover of \"Good to Me\"—written by Brendan Benson and Jason Falkner —as its B-side, while the latter included both \"Good to Me\" and folk song \" Black Jack Davey \". The photograph used as the single's artwork was taken by Patrick Pantano; it includes an elephant painting made by Greg Siemasz. On January 3, 2014, Third Man Records announced a limited edition clear 7-inch vinyl reissue of \"Seven Nation Army\" as part of a package for subscribers to its Vault service.

The triangle slides alternate between images of Jack or Meg playing, interspersed with marching skeletons and an elephant, referring to the name of the album \"Seven Nation Army\" appeared on.

Plastic Beach also featured the largest cast of collaborators featured yet on a Gorillaz album, fulfilling Albarn's goal of \"work[ing] with an incredibly eclectic, surprising cast of people\" including artists such as Snoop Dogg , Mos Def , Bobby Womack , Little Dragon , the former Velvet Underground frontman Lou Reed and Gruff Rhys among others, and also included orchestral contributions from Sinfonia Viva and the Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music . Albarn explained the expanded roster of featured artists represented his and Hewlett's new vision of Gorillaz as a project, explaining in a July 2008 interview that \"Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters any more – it's more like an organisation of people doing new projects... That's my ideal model.\" The 2010 live shows supporting Plastic Beach saw the touring band performing in full view of the audience for the first time. Released on 3 March 2010, Plastic Beach debuted at No. 2 on both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200 chart, the band's highest placing debut chart position.

To promote the album, the band embarked on the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour , the band's first world tour and also their first live performances in which the touring band performed fully in view of the audience on stage with no visual obstructions. The tour, which featured many of the collaborative artists from Plastic Beach and saw the touring band wearing naval attire, was later described by Albarn as having been extremely costly to produce, with the band barely breaking even on the shows, saying \"I loved doing it, but economically it was a fucking disaster.\" The tour was preceded by headline performances at several international music festivals, including the Coachella and Glastonbury festivals. On 21 November 2010, while still on tour, the band released the non-album single \" Doncamatic \" featuring British singer Daley .

      "summary": "**Title**: Gorillaz Plastic Beach Era\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe 2010 album *Plastic Beach* marked Gorillaz’s shift toward electronic pop and featured their largest-ever roster of collaborators, including Snoop Dogg, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Lou Reed, and orchestral ensembles. Supporting the album, the costly “Escape to Plastic Beach Tour” was the first to showcase the live band openly on stage. While on the North-American leg, Damon Albarn recorded *The Fall* entirely on an iPad as a tour diary. Creative tensions between Albarn and illustrator Jamie Hewlett escalated during this period, leading to a publicized fallout and a multi-year hiatus. After reconciling in 2014, the pair reconvened to create 2017’s *Humanz*, conceived as a dystopian party soundtrack reacting to Donald Trump’s election, again packed with high-profile guests and co-produced by the Twilite Tone and Remi Kabaka Jr.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nPlastic Beach, Escape to Plastic Beach Tour, The Fall, Humanz, Albarn-Hewlett fallout",

      "summary": "**Title**: Korn’s 2010s Album Cycle & Lineup Changes  \n\n**Summary**:  \nThe chunks chronicle Korn’s creative and personnel shifts from 2010-2016, centering on three albums—*Korn III: Remember Who You Are*, the dubstep-infused *The Path of Totality*, and the return-to-form *The Paradigm Shift*. After Roadrunner releases, the band embraced EDM collaborations (*Totality*), scored a gold single with “Get Up!”, and won Revolver’s Album of the Year. Guitarist Brian “Head” Welch’s permanent reunion, temporary bassist Ryan Martinie, and producer Nick Raskulinecz framed the 2013 comeback record *The Paradigm Shift*, supported by the single “Never Never” and a revived Family Values Tour. Subsequent years saw *The Serenity of Suffering* (2016) featuring Corey Taylor, reinforcing Korn’s heavier direction.  \n\n**Keywords**:  \nKorn albums 2010s, Brian Welch return, The Path of Totality, The Paradigm Shift, The Serenity of Suffering",
