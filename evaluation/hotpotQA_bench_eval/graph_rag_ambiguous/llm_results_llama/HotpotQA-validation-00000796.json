Founded in Gurgaon , India , and legally domiciled in Bermuda , Genpact employs more than 125,000 people and provides services to clients in over 30 countries worldwide. Genpact is listed on the NYSE and generated revenues of US$4.48 billion in 2023. History Founding and early developments Genpact was founded in 1997 as a unit of General Electric . The company was founded as GE Capital International Services (GECIS) in Gurgaon . Starting with 20 employees under the leadership of CEO Pramod Bhasin , its charter was to provide business process outsourcing solutions to GE's businesses. In the beginning, GECIS created processes for outsourcing back-office activities for GE Capital such as processing car loans and credit card transactions. It was an experimental concept at the time and the beginning of the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. One year after its launch, GECIS employed about 800 people and generated revenues of US$4 million. By 2001, GECIS operations had grown to 12,000 employees and the company began to manage a wide range of processes across GE's financial services and manufacturing businesses. Jack Welch , CEO of GE at the time, said that GECIS was a key driver of GE’s growth between 1998 and 2001, and was responsible for reducing operating costs by approximately US$1 billion. In 2003, GE reduced its stake in GECIS to 40% and sold the remainder to two American private equity firms. At the time of the sale, GECIS employed around 13,000 people in India and 4,000 people in the US, China, Hungary and Mexico, providing a range of solutions in areas such as finance and accounting , insurance claim processing , IT management and technical support . By 2004, GECIS oversaw around 700 business processes for GE that had migrated from the US to India, generating revenues of US$426 million. Independence and international growth In January 2005, the company became independent and started to serve clients outside of GE. As part of this transition, the company changed its name to Genpact for “generating business impact.” Also in 2005, the company opened additional offices in India and by the end of the year, recorded US$493 million in revenue, with 15% coming from new global clients, and the remaining 85% from GE. In 2006, Genpact further expanded in India, the Philippines, Mexico and China. In August 2007, Genpact was listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'G'. The company continued to grow, opening offices in six additional countries that same year and launching a joint venture with the Indian company NDTV to offer outsourcing services for",

The Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company was incorporated on 1 August 1849 by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company Act 1849 ( 12 & 13 Vict. c. lxxxiii) of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . It had a share capital of 50,000 pounds. On 21 August 1847 it entered into a formal contract with the East India Company for the construction and operation of a railway line, 56 km long, to form part of a trunk line connecting Bombay with Khandesh and Berar and generally with the other presidencies of India. The Court of Directors of the East India Company appointed James John Berkley as Chief Resident Engineer and Charles Buchanan Ker and Robert Wilfred Graham as his assistants. It was India's first passenger railway, the original 21 miles (33.8 km) section opening in 1853, between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tanna (now Thane ). On 1 July 1925, its management was taken over by the government. On 5 November 1951, it was incorporated into the Central Railway. Monogram of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, in CSMT Railway Station 's booking office Incorporation in London The Great Indian Peninsula Railway was incorporated as a company in 1849 by John Chapman , with its head office in London. The line was initially proposed to run for a length of 1,300 mi (2,100 km), to connect Bombay with the interior of the Indian peninsula and to the major port of Madras ( Chennai ) on the east coast. It was intended to connect the towns of Poona ( Pune ), Nassuek ( Nashik ), Aurungabad ( Aurangabad ), Ahmednuggur ( Ahmednagar ), Sholapoor ( Solapur ), Nagpur , Akola (West Berar), Oomrawutty ( Amravati ), and Hyderabad . It was meant for the purpose of increasing the export of cotton, silk, opium, sugar and spices. The management committee consisted of 25 British men, including officials of the East India Company and banks in London, most of whom resided in Britain and some who had resided in India. The original 25 person board consisted of people such as John Stuart-Wortley and William Hamilton (both MPs from Britain who became the company's chairman and deputy chairman), Frederick Ayrton (ex-East India Company), cavalrymen such as Major Clayton and Major-General Briggs, Bombay residents John Graham, Col.

However, in 2019, Chipotle paid $6.5 million to settle a lawsuit where the plaintiffs claimed that the company's food \"may have been sourced from livestock that consumed GMO animal feed\". In 2017, Chipotle committed to transitioning away from birds bred to maximize growth at the expense of animal well-being. However, in 2024, investigations by animal welfare groups showed that they were failing to meet these standards. Food safety In its annual reports, Chipotle has acknowledged that it \"may be at a higher risk for food-borne illness outbreaks than some competitors due to our use of fresh produce and meats rather than frozen, and our reliance on employees cooking with traditional methods rather than automation\". Following the 2015 outbreaks, some food safety experts and media commentators argued that the variety of pathogens involved pointed to systemic problems with the company's food handling practices. On December 10, 2015, CEO Steve Ells released a statement apologizing for the outbreaks and promised changes to minimize future risks. Food poisoning outbreaks March 2008 hepatitis In March and April 2008, the Community Epidemiology Branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency traced a hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego County to a single Chipotle restaurant located in La Mesa, California , in which 22 customers were infected with the virus. April 2008 norovirus In 2008, Chipotle was implicated in a norovirus outbreak in Kent, Ohio , where over 400 people became ill after eating at a Chipotle restaurant. Officials at the Ohio Department of Health said that the outbreak was caused by Norovirus Genotype G2 . Many of the victims were students at Kent State University . The initial source of the outbreak was never found. July 2015 E. coli In early November 2015, The Oregonian reported that there was a little-known E. coli outbreak that had occurred earlier in July in which five people were infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli . The outbreak was traced to a single Chipotle location in Seattle and that the incident was not publicized at that time. Seattle public health officials defended their actions at that time by saying that the outbreak was over by the time they made an association with Chipotle. Health officials were unable to trace the source of the July outbreak and said that the cause of the July outbreak is unrelated to the October/November outbreak.

Beginnings in Bombay An year after the passing of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company Act 1849 ( 12 & 13 Vict. c. lxxxiii), the first sod was turned ('Bhoomipujan' was done) of the first rail line at Sion on 30 October 1850, by the Chief secretary of Bombay Government, John P. Willoughby. The line was meant to be an \"experimental line\" between Bombay and Thana , whose gauge was set at 5' 6'' (1676 mm) by Governor General Lord Dalhousie in January 1851. The contract for this segment was handed to the contractors Faviell and Fowler, while the next segment from Tannah to Callian (today's Kalyan) to contractors George Wythes and William Jackson along with Jamsetjee Dorabjee Naegamwalla. Work began, but was soon slowed down by heavy showers in October 1851. This was the same year the first locomotives for this line (Locomotives GIP-1 to 8 ) were built at the Vulcan Foundry in England. Several problems were encountered, for instance, the laying of the line among the swamp at Sion, worker strikes, among others. Then there was a question of whether the experimental line be a single line, or a double line. The contract opted for the latter option, but there were other ideas. Doing this would have saved money. In the end, the Government of Bombay asked to retain the 'double line' option, owing to complications in contracts and finances. First locomotive The following year, in 1852, Bombay received its first locomotive. Built by E. B. Wilson , the same firm that built Roorkee 's locomotive Thomason, it was brought by sea to Bombay. The Bombay Telegraph of 17 February states that \"She had been landed six days ...\" suggesting that the locomotive landed in Bombay on 11 or 12 February 1852. On its arrival, it was pulled down a public road by 200 coolies, before it was put on the rails. This Locomotive was named \" Lord Falkland \" after the then Governor of Bombay, Lucius Bentinck Cary , who reportedly left",
