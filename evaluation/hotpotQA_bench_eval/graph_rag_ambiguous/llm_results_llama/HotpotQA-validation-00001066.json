      "text": "Roger Joseph Ebert ( / ˈ iː b ər t / EE -bərt ; June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American film critic , film historian, essayist, screenwriter and author. He wrote for the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. Ebert was known for his intimate, Midwestern writing style and critical views informed by values of populism and humanism . Writing in a prose style intended to be entertaining and direct, he made sophisticated cinematic and analytical ideas more accessible to non-specialist audiences. Ebert endorsed foreign and independent films he believed would be appreciated by mainstream viewers, championing filmmakers like Werner Herzog , Errol Morris and Spike Lee , as well as Martin Scorsese , whose first published review he wrote. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism . Neil Steinberg of the Chicago Sun-Times said Ebert \"was without question the nation's most prominent and influential film critic\", and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called him \"the best-known film critic in America\". Per The New York Times , \"The force and grace of his opinions propelled film criticism into the mainstream of American culture. Not only did he advise moviegoers about what to see, but also how to think about what they saw.\" Early in his career, Ebert co-wrote the Russ Meyer film Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970). Starting in 1975 and continuing for decades, Ebert and Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel helped popularize nationally televised film reviewing when they co-hosted the PBS show Sneak Previews , followed by several variously named At the Movies programs on commercial TV broadcast syndication . The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. They created and trademarked the phrase \"two thumbs up,\" used when both gave the same film a positive review. After Siskel died from a brain tumor in 1999, Ebert continued hosting the show with various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with Richard Roeper . In 1996, Ebert began publishing essays on great films of the past; the first hundred were published as The Great Movies . He published two more volumes, and a fourth was published posthumously. In 1999, he founded the Overlooked Film Festival in Champaign, Illinois . In 2002, Ebert was diagnosed with cancer of the thyroid and salivary glands . He required treatment that included removing a section of his lower jaw in 2006, leaving him severely disfigured and unable to speak or eat normally. However, his ability to write remained unimpaired and he continued to publish frequently online and in print until his death in 2013. His RogerEbert.com website, launched in 2002,",

      "text": "Eugene Gladstone O'Neill (October 16, 1888 – November 27, 1953) was an American playwright. His poetically titled plays were among the first to introduce into the U.S. the drama techniques of realism , earlier associated with Chekhov , Ibsen , and Strindberg . The tragedy Long Day's Journey into Night is often included on lists of the finest American plays in the 20th century, alongside Tennessee Williams 's A Streetcar Named Desire and Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman . He was awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize in Literature . O'Neill is also the only playwright to win four Pulitzer Prizes for Drama . O'Neill's plays were among the first to include speeches in American English vernacular and involve characters on the fringes of society. They struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations, ultimately sliding into disillusion and despair. Of his very few comedies, only one is well known ( Ah, Wilderness! ). Nearly all of his other plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism. Early life Birthplace plaque (1500 Broadway, northeast corner of 43rd and Broadway, New York City), presented by Circle in the Square O'Neill was born on October 16, 1888, in a hotel, the Barrett House, on what was then Longacre Square (now Times Square ) in New York City. A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway , which houses offices, shops, and the ABC Studios . Portrait of O'Neill as a child, c. 1893 He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan , who was also of Irish descent. His father suffered from alcoholism; his mother from an addiction to morphine, prescribed to relieve the pains of the difficult birth of her third son Eugene. Because his father was often on tour with a theatrical company accompanied by his mother, in 1895 O'Neill was sent to St. Aloysius Academy for Boys , a Catholic boarding school in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. In 1900 he became a day student at the De La Salle Institute on 59th Street in Manhattan. The O'Neill family reunited for summers at the Monte Cristo Cottage in New London, Connecticut . He also briefly attended Betts Academy in Stamford. He attended Princeton University for one year. Accounts vary as to why he left. He may have been dropped for attending too few classes, been suspended for \"conduct code violations\", or \"for breaking a window\", or according to a more concrete but possibly apocryphal account, because he threw \"a beer bottle into the window of Professor Woodrow Wilson \", the future president of the United States.

      "text": "Siskel took a leave of absence from the show to undergo brain surgery. He returned to the show, although viewers noticed a change in his physical appearance. Despite appearing sluggish and tired, Siskel continued reviewing films with Ebert and would appear on Late Show with David Letterman . In February 1999, Siskel died of a brain tumor. The producers renamed the show Roger Ebert & the Movies and used rotating co-hosts including Martin Scorsese , Janet Maslin and A.O. Scott . Ebert wrote of his late colleague: \"For the first five years that we knew one another, Gene Siskel and I hardly spoke. Then it seemed like we never stopped.\" He wrote of Siskel's work ethic, of how quickly he returned to work after surgery: \"Someone else might have taken a leave of absence then and there, but Gene worked as long as he could. Being a film critic was important to him. He liked to refer to his job as 'the national dream beat,' and say that in reviewing movies he was covering what people hoped for, dreamed about, and feared.\" Ebert recalled, \"Whenever he interviewed someone for his newspaper or for television, Gene Siskel liked to end with the same question: 'What do you know for sure?' OK Gene, what do I know for sure about you? You were one of the smartest, funniest, quickest men I've ever known and one of the best reporters...I know for sure that seeing a truly great movie made you so happy that you'd tell me a week later your spirits were still high.\" Ten years after Siskel's death, Ebert blogged about his colleague: \"We once spoke with Disney and CBS about a sitcom to be titled Best Enemies . It would be about two movie critics joined in a love/hate relationship. It never went anywhere, but we both believed it was a good idea. Maybe the problem was that no one else could possibly understand how meaningless was the hate, how deep was the love.\" 2000–2006: Ebert & Roeper In September 2000, Chicago Sun-Times columnist Richard Roeper became the permanent co-host and the show was renamed At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper and later Ebert & Roeper . In 2000, Ebert interviewed President Bill Clinton about movies at The White House . In 2002, Ebert was diagnosed with cancer of the salivary glands. In 2006, cancer surgery resulted in his losing his ability to eat and speak. In 2007, prior to his Overlooked Film Festival, he posted a picture of his new condition. Paraphrasing a line from Raging Bull (1980), he wrote, \"I ain’t a pretty boy no more. (Not that I ever was. The original appeal of Siskel & Ebert was that we didn't look like we belonged on",

      "text": "Julius Caesar is a 1950 film adaptation of the Shakespeare play Julius Caesar starring Charlton Heston . The first film version of the play with sound, it was produced and directed by David Bradley using actors from the Chicago area. Heston, who had known Bradley since his youth and who was establishing himself in television and theater in New York City, portrayed Mark Antony . He was the only paid cast member. Bradley himself played Brutus , and Harold Tasker had the title role. Plot Cast Charlton Heston as Mark Antony David Bradley as Brutus Harold Tasker as Julius Caesar Bob Holt as Octavius Caesar Production The 16 mm film was shot in 1949 on several locations around the Chicago area, including Soldier Field , the Museum of Science and Industry , the Field Museum of Natural History , the downtown post office, and the Elks National Veterans Memorial . The Indiana sand dunes on Lake Michigan were used for the Battle of Philippi . One indoor set was built in the Chicago suburb of Evanston . To save money, around 80% of the film was shot silently with the dialogue dubbed in later by the actors. Production shot from Julius Caesar Jeffrey Hunter appears in a small part. Release After its premiere in Evanston in 1950, the film had only a limited distribution in the United States, where it was mainly shown in schools and colleges. In 1951, it played at the Edinburgh International Film Festival , then opened in New York City in late 1952. The film was shown at the Locarno Film Festival in 1953 where it tied for first place for the first prize . On the basis of a private screening in Hollywood, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer hired Bradley as a directing intern in 1950. Two decades later, Heston reprised his role as Mark Antony in both Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra . Critical reception Upon the film's opening in New York City, The New York Times credited its \"company of earnest collegians\" with giving \"firm pictorial character\" to classic drama.

They had disappeared mysteriously during the day and there was no clue to their whereabouts.\" O'Neill stamp issued in 1967 O'Neill died at the Sheraton Hotel (now Boston University 's Kilachand Hall ) on Bay State Road in Boston on November 27, 1953, at age 65. As he was dying, he whispered: \"I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.\" He is interred in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston 's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. In 1956 Carlotta arranged for his autobiographical play Long Day's Journey into Night to be published, although his written instructions had stipulated that it not be made public until 25 years after his death. It was produced on stage to tremendous critical acclaim and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957. It is widely considered his finest play. Other posthumously published works include A Touch of the Poet (1958) and More Stately Mansions (1967). In 1967 the United States Postal Service honored O'Neill with a Prominent Americans series (1965–1978) $1 postage stamp. In 2000 a team of researchers studying O'Neill's autopsy report concluded that he died of cerebellar cortical atrophy , a rare form of brain deterioration unrelated to either alcohol use or Parkinson's disease. Legacy In Warren Beatty 's 1981 film Reds , O'Neill is portrayed by Jack Nicholson , who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. George C. White founded the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center in Waterford, Connecticut in 1964. Eugene O'Neill is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame .

Bright eventually lettered in football , track, and basketball, during his collegiate career at Drake. Following a mandatory freshman redshirt year, Bright began his collegiate football career in 1949, rushing for 975 yards and throwing for another 975, to lead the nation in total offense during his sophomore year, as the Drake Bulldogs finished their season at 6–2–1. In Bright's junior year, the halfback / quarterback rushed for 1,232 yards and passed for 1,168 yards, setting an NCAA record for total offense (2,400 yards) in 1950, and again led the Bulldogs to a 6–2–1 record. Bright's senior year began with great promise. Bright was considered a pre-season Heisman Trophy candidate, and was leading the nation in both rushing and total offense with 821 and 1,349 yards respectively, when the Drake Bulldogs, winners of their previous five games, faced Missouri Valley Conference foe Oklahoma A&M , at Lewis Field (now Boone Pickens Stadium ) in Stillwater, Oklahoma , on October 20, 1951.  \"Johnny Bright Incident\" Johnny Bright Incident – October 21, 1951 Des Moines Register newspaper cover showing Robinson and Ultang photo sequence Bright's participation as a halfback/quarterback in Drake's game against Oklahoma A&M on October 20, 1951, was controversial, as it marked the first time that such a prominent African-American athlete, with national fame (Bright was a pre-season Heisman Trophy candidate, and led the nation in total offense going into the game) and of critical importance to the success of his team (Drake was undefeated and carried a five-game winning streak into the contest, due in large part to his rushing and passing), played against Oklahoma A&M in a home game at Lewis Field , in Stillwater. During the first seven minutes of the game, Bright had been knocked unconscious three times by blows from Oklahoma A&M defensive tackle Wilbanks Smith . While the final, elbow blow from Smith broke Bright's jaw, Bright was able to complete a 61-yard touchdown pass to halfback Jim Pilkington a few plays later, before the injury finally forced Bright to leave the game. Bright finished the game with 75 yards (14 yards rushing and 61 yards passing), the first time he had finished a game, with less than 100 yards in his three-year collegiate career at Drake. Oklahoma A&M eventually won the game 27–14.

Richard Corliss , in Film Comment , called the show \"a sitcom (with its own noodling, toodling theme song) starring two guys who live in a movie theater and argue all the time\". Ebert responded that \"I am the first to agree with Corliss that the Siskel and Ebert program is not in-depth film criticism\" but that \"When we have an opinion about a movie, that opinion may light a bulb above the head of an ambitious youth who then understands that people can make up their own minds about movies.\" He also noted that they did \"theme shows\" condemning colorization and showing the virtues of letterboxing . He argued that \"good criticism is commonplace these days. Film Comment itself is healthier and more widely distributed than ever before. Film Quarterly is, too; it even abandoned eons of tradition to increase its page size. And then look at Cinéaste and American Film and the specialist film magazines (you may not read Fangoria , but if you did, you would be amazed at the erudition its writers bring to the horror and special effects genres.)\" Corliss wrote that \"I do think the program has other merits, and said so in a sentence of my original article that didn't make it into type: 'Sometimes the show does good: in spotlighting foreign and independent films, and in raising issues like censorship and colorization.' The stars' recent excoriation of the MPAA's X rating was salutary to the max.\" In 1996, W. W. Norton & Company asked Ebert to edit an anthology of film writing. This resulted in Roger Ebert's Book of Film: From Tolstoy to Tarantino, the Finest Writing From a Century of Film . The selections are eclectic, ranging from Louise Brooks 's autobiography to David Thomson 's novel Suspects . Ebert \"wrote to Nigel Wade, then the editor of the Chicago Sun-Times , and proposed a biweekly series of longer articles great movies of the past. He gave his blessing ... Every other week I have revisited a great movie, and the response has been encouraging.\" The first film he wrote about for the series was Casablanca (1942).

Competing at Wrigley Field (then Cubs Park), they posted a 2-5-1 record against APFA opponents despite never formally joining the league. Key figures included quarterback Johnny Barrett and ends Jack Meagher and Oscar Knop, with a passing attack noted as their offensive strength. A high-profile 10-0 loss to George Halas’ Decatur Staleys and a later 6-3 defeat to the Racine Cardinals fueled a legend that the Tigers agreed to disband if they lost the city’s “winner-take-all” showdown, though evidence for this pact is weak. The team folded after 1920, succeeded in local lore by the Hammond Pros and ultimately the Staleys, who became the Chicago Bears.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nChicago Tigers, 1920 APFA season, Wrigley Field, George Halas, NFL franchise folding",

After Siskel’s 1999 death from a brain tumor, Ebert continued with rotating co-hosts and then Richard Roeper, while publishing essay collections such as “The Great Movies,” founding Ebertfest, and blogging prolifically even after 2006 cancer surgeries left him unable to speak or eat.
