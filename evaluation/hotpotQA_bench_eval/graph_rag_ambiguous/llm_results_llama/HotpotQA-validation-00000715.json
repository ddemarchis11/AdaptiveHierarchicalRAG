His vocal delivery was later described by Lamm as \"The White Ray Charles \". Pankow, who wrote \"Make Me Smile\", tried rehearsing the song with various members singing lead, but ultimately settled on Kath, saying \"bingo – 'that' was the voice.\" Kath was one of the three primary lead singers of Chicago, with a vocal range between those of the other two, Peter Cetera 's higher tenor and Robert Lamm 's fuller, lower baritone. He often collaborated with Cetera on lead vocals as they did in \" Dialogue (Part I & II) ,\" \"Ain't It Blue,\" \"In The Country,\" and \" Brand New Love Affair \". Kath also played lead guitar and sang lead vocals on the closing song \"Tell Me\" in the 1973 drama movie Electra Glide in Blue . The song was used in the final episode of the television series Miami Vice . Personal life and death Kath had a self-admitted history of drug abuse , including alcohol . Seraphine knew that Kath had a high tolerance for drugs and he later recalled Kath telling him: \"I'm going to get things under control ... if I don't, this stuff is going to kill me.\" Chicago bandmates, including Seraphine, had noted that he was then also becoming increasingly unhappy. The night before he died, Kath visited bandmate Laudir de Oliveira . De Oliveira offered him tea and the two spent all night talking. Guercio has said that Kath was finishing writing a solo album before he died and Pankow has adamantly denied that Kath was suicidal. Kath enjoyed target shooting and by 1978 he was regularly carrying guns. On Monday, January 23, after a party at the home of roadie and band technician Don Johnson in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California , Kath began to play with his guns. He spun his unloaded .38 revolver on his finger, put it to his temple and pulled the trigger. Johnson warned Kath several times to be careful. Kath picked up a semi-automatic 9 mm pistol and, leaning back in a chair, said to Johnson: \"Don't worry about it ... Look, the clip is not even in it.\" His last words were, \"What do you think I'm gonna do? Blow my brains out?\" To calm Johnson's concerns, Kath showed him the empty magazine. Kath then replaced the magazine in the gun, put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. Apparently unbeknownst to Kath, the gun had a round in the chamber . He died instantly from the gunshot, eight days shy of his 32nd birthday. Kath left behind his wife, Camelia",

They have released eight studio albums, Less Is More (1996), Come Again (1998), A Different High (2001), Free Kicks (2004), Even (2007), In Another Time (2011), Satin Returns (2018), and Reverse Light Years (2021). History 1994–1995: Formation and early EPs Future members of Even, Matthew Cotter on drums and Ashley Naylor on lead vocals and lead guitar, played music together at a high school in Melbourne. They formed an indie band, The Swarm, with Francis Leach on vocals and David Rowland on bass guitar. The Swarm issued three independent singles between November 1988 and April 1991 before disbanding. In March 1994 Cotter and Naylor were joined by Roderick \"Wally\" Kempton (also a member of The Meanies , as Wally Meanie) on bass guitar to form an indie guitar pop group, Even. Even played their first gig in March 1994 at the Empress of India Hotel in Fitzroy . Ten years later Naylor told Michael Dwyer of The Age that \"It was very exciting, because we did a soundcheck and people were applauding us... We were bristling to play, absolutely bursting with energy. Flaming youth, Kiss would have called it.\" Even signed to an independent label, Rubber Records. In May 1995 Even issued a six-track extended play, In Stereo , distributed by Shock Records . It was produced by Andy Baldwin, Andy O'Beirne, Lindsay Gravina and Bruce Mowson. National youth radio station, Triple J , added the track, \"24 Hour Cynic\", to high rotation. In late 1996 they provided a live-in-the-studio version of \"24 Hour Cynic\" for a various artists' compilation, Triple J – Live . Even followed in November 1995 with a five-track EP, Ten to Forty-Six , which included the lead track, \"Stupid Dream\". 1996–2003: Less Is More , Come Again and A Different High Even released their debut studio album, Less Is More on 10 June 1996 via Rubber Records/Shock Records. It was co-produced by Even with Greg Wales ( Drop City ) and mixed by Wales with Nick Launay .

After supporting international acts, The Presidents of the United States, The Posies, Ash and Everclear, in Australia; Even toured the United States and then Europe from March 1997. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997 in September Less Is More was nominated for Best Independent Release . In November 1997 they issued a third EP, One Side Not , with four tracks. It was recorded at Seed Studios by Wales with Tim Johnston. The group issued their second studio album, Come Again , on 28 September 1998, which was produced by Tony Lash (The Dandy Warhols, Eric Matthews). McFarlane felt it \"fulfilled the promise of the debut with its full quota of bright guitar melodies and top-flight songs.\" AllMusic 's James Damas described it as \"one of the most overlooked and consistent rock & roll albums of the late '90s.\" Tim Rogers of fellow Australian group, You Am I, quipped that it was his \"favourite Beatles album\". It provided three singles, \"No Surprises\" (August 1998), \"Black Umbrella\" (November) and \"Sunshine Comes\" (September 1999). From early 1999 Naylor collaborated with alternative country artist, Sherry Rich , to form a folk pop duo, The Grapes. They issued a self-titled album in October which McFarlane observed was \"full of rich sixties melodies, catchy guitar hooks, perfect harmonies, jangling guitars and country influences.\" Even's third studio album, A Different High , was issued on 14 May 2001, which peaked at No. 48 on the ARIA Albums Chart , and reached No. 10 on the ARIA Alternative Albums Chart. Guesting on the album were Renée Geyer on vocals, Graham Lee (ex- The Triffids ) on pedal steel guitar and Bruce Haymes (of Paul Kelly Band ) on organ, piano and Wurlitzer.

They later became teachers and trained notable Carnatic music singers. Jayalakshmi was the playback singer of the duo, but was credited as Radha Jayalakshmi in the cine field. Radha was her cousin and singing partner on stage performances. They were early vocalists in the duo singing trend in Carnatic music which started in the 1950s and includes performers like Bombay Sisters and Soolamangalam Sisters . In recent times, the trend has been continued by popular Carnatic music singers like Priya Sisters , their disciples, Ranjani Gayatri , Bellur sisters, Mambalam Sisters, Akkarai sisters , and others. The duo was awarded the 1981 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in Carnatic Music – Vocal, given by the Sangeet Natak Akademi , India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama Vidushi Jayalakshmi died in Chennai on 27 May 2014. Early life and training Radha and Jayalakshmi's singing style belongs to the G. N. Balasubramaniam school, and they received their training in classical vocal music from the noted vocalist and teacher himself. Career Jayalakshmi has rendered songs in her trained, cultured and 'ringing' sweet voice in Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada movies from the late 1940s to the early 60s. She also has a few playback singing credits from the 1970s. In Deivam, Kunnakkudi Vaidyanathan had both Radha and Jayalakshmi render Thiruchendooril Por Purindhu , a devotional song set in Thiruthani. This is perhaps the only film song sung by Radha of the duo. But both have given stage performances throughout India. The singers had no longer been giving performances towards the time of Jayalakshmi's death, but instead had shifted their efforts to teaching Carnatic music and were regarded as great teachers. Shanmukhapriya and Haripriya, popularly known as the Priya Sisters , were their students. Music composers Jayalakshmi sang for Jayalakshmi's most memorable songs date from the 50s films. S.

Beyond topping charts worldwide, the song’s sonic DNA—drum intro, synth-bass pulse, and sparse three-note motif—has been dissected and praised for its perfect blend of rhythm, melody, and engineering clarity. Its cultural footprint spans answer songs, countless cover versions (The Bates, Sound Bluntz, Ian Brown, Chris Cornell), persistent club rotation exceeding 250,000 weekly plays, and perennial rankings among the greatest songs of all time by Rolling Stone, BBC Radio 2, and British TV polls.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nBillie Jean, Michael Jackson, Thriller, bassline, cover versions",

Revered by peers (Jimi Hendrix called him “the best guitarist in the universe”), Kath also shaped Chicago’s vocal palette with a Ray Charles–tinged baritone. Struggling with substance abuse and depression, he died at 31 from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot, prompting the band to memorialize him with songs like “Alive Again.”  \n\n**Keywords**: Chicago guitarist, Terry Kath vocals, rock-jazz fusion, accidental death, underrated guitar legend",
