Gimmigela Chuli , or The Twins , are two-peak mountains in the Himalayas , located on the border between Taplejung , Mechi , Nepal and Sikkim , India . Location It has an elevation of 7,350 m (24,110 ft) above sea level and prominence is at 432 m (1,417 ft). It is situated approximately 4.2 km (2.6 mi) NNE from Kangchenjunga . The mountain has a subpeak , Gimmigela Chuli II 7,005 m (22,982 ft) metres; prominence is at 185 m (607 ft). This subpeak, sometimes referred to as \"Gimmigela's Sister\", lies entirely within India. Together the two peaks, Gimmigela I and Gimmigela II, are known as \"The Twins\". Climbing history A Japanese expedition attempted to reach the west (main) summit in 1993 via the east ridge from Sikkim , ending on 18 October 1993 after the death of expedition leader Masanori Sato. The team had achieved the first ascent of Gimmigela II and were on the summit ridge connecting the two peaks in an attempt to summit Gimmigela I when Sato fell 35 metres (115 ft) into a hidden crevasse . Despite the efforts of the other team members, his body was not recovered and the expedition was terminated. One year later in October 1994, Taroh Tanigawa, Koji Nagakubo and Yuichi Yoshida, members of the failed attempt in 1993, achieved the first ascent of Gimmigela I.

They are believed to have been formed by the wastes created by the weathering of the ancient Aravali mountains. Geographically, it separates Northern India from Southern India. The western end of the range lies in eastern Gujarat, near its border with Madhya Pradesh, and runs east and north, almost meeting the Ganges at Mirzapur . Satpura Range , lies south of Vindhya range and east of Aravali range, begins in eastern Gujarat near the Arabian Sea coast and runs east across Maharashtra , Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh . It extends 900 km (560 mi) with many peaks rising above 1,000 m (3,300 ft). It is triangular in shape, with its apex at Ratnapuri and the two sides being parallel to the Tapti and Narmada rivers. It runs parallel to the Vindhya Range, which lies to the north, and these two east–west ranges divide the Indo–Gangetic plain from the Deccan Plateau located north of River Narmada. Plateaus (clockwise from top-left) Malwa Plateau is spread across Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The average elevation of the Malwa plateau is 500 metres, and the landscape generally slopes towards the north. Most of the region is drained by the Chambal River and its tributaries; the western part is drained by the upper reaches of the Mahi River . Chhota Nagpur Plateau is situated in eastern India, covering much of Jharkhand and adjacent parts of Odisha, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. Its total area is approximately 65,000 km 2 (25,000 sq mi) and is made up of three smaller plateaus—the Ranchi, Hazaribagh, and Kodarma plateaus. The Ranchi plateau is the largest, with an average elevation of 700 m (2,300 ft). Much of the plateau is forested, covered by the Chhota Nagpur dry deciduous forests . Vast reserves of metal ores and coal have been found in the Chota Nagpur plateau. Southern Garanulite terrain : Covers South India especially Tamil Nadu excluding western and eastern ghats. The Southern Granulite Terrain (SGT) is one of the most geologically significant regions of the Indian Shield. It represents the southernmost part of the Indian peninsula, situated south of the stable Dharwar Craton .Unlike the lower-grade metamorphic rocks found further north, the SGT is composed of high-grade metamorphic rocks (granulites) that were formed deep within the Earth's crust under extreme pressure and temperature.

Parts of the coastal plains , including the Coromandel Coast region, lie between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal.Though not as tall as the Western Ghats, some of its peaks are over 1,000 m (3,300 ft) in height. The Nilgiri hills in Tamil Nadu lies at the junction of the Eastern and Western Ghats. Arma Konda (1,690 m (5,540 ft)) in Andhra Pradesh is the tallest peak in Eastern Ghats. The Eastern Ghats are older than the Western Ghats, and have a complex geologic history related to the assembly and breakup of the ancient supercontinent of Rodinia and the assembly of the Gondwana supercontinent. The Eastern Ghats are made up of charnockites , granite gneiss , khondalites , metamorphic gneisses and quartzite rock formations. The structure of the Eastern Ghats includes thrusts and strike-slip faults all along its range. Limestone , bauxite and iron ore are found in the Eastern Ghats hill ranges. Indo-Gangetic plain Extent of the Indo-Gangetic plain across South Asia Many areas remain flooded during the heavy rains brought by monsoon in the Indian state of West Bengal . The Indo-Gangetic plains, also known as the Great Plains are large alluvial plains dominated by three main rivers, the Indus , Ganges , and Brahmaputra . They run parallel to the Himalayas, from Jammu and Kashmir in the west to Assam in the east, drain most of northern and eastern India and extend into Pakistan. The plains encompass an area of 700,000 km 2 (270,000 sq mi). The major rivers in this region are the Ganges, Indus, and Brahmaputra along with their main tributaries— Yamuna , Chambal , Gomti , Ghaghara , Kosi , Sutlej , Ravi , Beas , Chenab , and Tista —as well as the rivers of the Ganges Delta , such as the Meghna . The great plains are sometimes classified into four divisions: The Bhabar belt is adjacent to the foothills of the Himalayas and consists of boulders and pebbles which have been carried down by streams. As the porosity of this belt is very high, the streams flow underground. The Bhabar is generally narrow with its width varying between 6 and 15 km",

One such passage is the Bhor Ghat that connects the towns Khopoli and Khandala , on NH 4 about 80 kilometres (50 mi) north of Mumbai . Charmadi Ghat of Karnataka is also notable. In many cases, the term is used to refer to a mountain range itself, as in the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats . 'Ghattam' in Malayalam also refers to mountain ranges when used with the name of the ranges being addressed (e.g., paschima ghattam for Western Ghats), while the passage road would be called a 'churam'. Eastern Ghats on the east coast of India and Western Ghats on the west coast of India are the largest ghats in pensular India. Western Ghats also known as Sahyadri (Benevolent Mountains) run along the western edge of India's Deccan Plateau and separate it from a narrow coastal plain along the Arabian Sea . The range covers an area of 140,000 km 2 in a stretch of 1,600 km (990 mi) parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula , from south of the Tapti River near the Gujarat–Maharashtra border and across Kerala , Tamil Nadu , Karnataka , Goa , Maharashtra and Gujarat . to the southern tip of the Deccan peninsula. The average elevation is around 1,000 m (3,300 ft). Anai Mudi in the Anaimalai Hills 2,695 m (8,842 ft) in Kerala is the highest peak in the Western Ghats. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the eight \"hottest hot-spots\" of biological diversity in the world. It is sometimes called the Great Escarpment of India. It is a biodiversity hotspot that contains a large proportion of the country's flora and fauna; many of which are only found here and nowhere else in the world. According to UNESCO , Western Ghats are older than Himalayan mountains. It also influences Indian monsoon weather patterns by intercepting the rain-laden monsoon winds that sweep in from the south-west during late summer.

An arc of mountains consisting of the Himalayas, Hindu Kush , and Patkai ranges define the northern frontiers of the Indian subcontinent. These were formed by the ongoing tectonic plates collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates . The mountains in these ranges include some of the world's tallest mountains which act as a barrier to cold polar winds. They also facilitate the monsoon winds which in turn influence the climate in India. Rivers originating in these mountains flow through the fertile Indo–Gangetic Plain. These mountains form the boundary between two biogeographic realms : the temperate Palearctic realm that covers most of Eurasia, and the tropical and subtropical Indomalayan realm which includes South Asia, Southeast Asia and Indonesia.  The Himalayas in India extend from Ladakh in the north to the state of Arunachal Pradesh in the east. Several Himalayan peaks in India rise above 7,000 m (23,000 ft), including Kanchenjunga (8,598 m (28,209 ft)) on the Sikkim – Nepal border, and Nanda Devi (7,816 m (25,643 ft)) in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand. The snow line ranges between 6,000 m (20,000 ft) in Sikkim to around 3,000 m (9,800 ft) in Ladakh. The Himalayas act as a barrier to the frigid katabatic winds flowing down from Central Asia. Thus, northern India is kept warm or only mildly cooled during winter; in summer, the same phenomenon makes India relatively hot.  The Karakoram range runs through Ladakh. The range is about 500 km (310 mi) in length and the most heavily glaciated part of the world outside of the polar regions.

The Ganges – Brahmaputra system occupies most of northern, central, and eastern India, while the Deccan Plateau occupies most of southern India. Kangchenjunga , in the Indian state of Sikkim , is the highest point in India at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) and the world's third highest peak . The climate across India ranges from equatorial in the far south, to alpine and tundra in the upper regions of the Himalayas. Geologically, India lies on the Indian Plate , the northern part of the Indo-Australian Plate . Geological development Proposed model of the collision of the Indian subcontinent with Asia to form the Himalayas. The area in green represents the hypothetical subducted and underthrust \"Greater India\" India is situated entirely on the Indian Plate , a major tectonic plate that was formed when it split off from the ancient continent Gondwanaland (ancient landmass, consisting of the southern part of the supercontinent of Pangea ). The Indo-Australian plate is subdivided into the Indian and Australian plates . About 90 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous Period , the Indian Plate began moving north at about 15 cm/year (6 in/yr). About 50 to 55 million years ago, in the Eocene Epoch of the Cenozoic Era , the plate collided with Asia after covering a distance of 2,000 to 3,000 km (1,243 to 1,864 mi), having moved faster than any other known plate. In 2007, German geologists determined that the Indian Plate was able to move so quickly because it is only half as thick as the other plates which formerly constituted Gondwanaland. The collision with the Eurasian Plate along the modern border between India and Nepal formed the orogenic belt that created the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas . As of 2009 [update] , the Indian Plate is moving northeast at 5 cm/yr (2 in/yr), while the Eurasian Plate is moving north at only 2 cm/yr (0.8 in/yr). India is thus referred to as the \"fastest continent\". This is causing the Eurasian Plate to deform, and the Indian Plate to compress at a rate of 4 cm/yr (1.6 in/yr). Political geography India is divided into 28 States (further subdivided into districts ) and 8 union territories including the National capital territory (i.e., Delhi ). India's borders run a total length of 15,200 km (9,400 mi).

Its western border with Pakistan extends up to 3,323 km (2,065 mi), dividing the Punjab region and running along the boundaries of the Thar Desert and the Rann of Kutch . This border runs along the Indian states and union territories of Ladakh , Jammu and Kashmir , Punjab , Rajasthan , and Gujarat . Both nations delineated a Line of Control (LoC) to serve as the informal boundary between the Indian and Pakistan-administered areas of the Kashmir region . India claims the whole of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir , which includes areas now administered by Pakistan and China, which according to India are illegally occupied areas. India's border with Bangladesh runs 4,096.70 km (2,545.57 mi). West Bengal , Assam , Meghalaya , Tripura and Mizoram are the states which share the border with Bangladesh. Before 2015, there were 92 enclaves of Bangladesh on Indian soil and 106 enclaves of India were on Bangladeshi soil. These enclaves were eventually exchanged in order to simplify the border. After the exchange, India lost roughly 40 km 2 (9,900 acres) to Bangladesh. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is the effective border between India and the People's Republic of China. It traverses 4,057 km along the Indian states and union territories of Ladakh , Himachal Pradesh , Uttarakhand , Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh .

Chandra Taal is near the source of the Chandra River . Despite the rugged and inhospitable surroundings, it is in a protected niche with some flowers and wildlife in summer. It is a favourite spot for tourists and high-altitude trekkers. It is usually associated with Spiti , although geographically it lies in the watershed of the Chandra River of Lahaul. Kunzum La separates Lahaul and Spiti valleys. It's surrounded by the Chandratal Wildlife Sanctuary . Description A view of the lake, Jul 2024 Chandra Taal Lake is on the Samudra Tapu plateau, which overlooks the Chandra River (a source river of the Chenab ). The name of the lake originates from its crescent shape. It is at an altitude of about 4,300 metres (14,100 ft) in the Himalayas . Mountains of scree overlook the lake on one side, and a cirque encloses it on the other. Access Foot path to Chandra Taal, Aug 2016 Chandra Taal is a tourist destination for trekkers and campers. The lake is accessible by road from Batal and by road as well as on foot from Kunzum Pass from late May to early October. The road to Chandra Taal branches off from NH-505 about 2.9 kilometres (1.8 mi) from Batal and 8 km (5.0 mi) from Kunzum Pass. This 12 km (7.5 mi) motor road runs as far as a parking lot 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from the lake. One has to travel on foot for the final 1 km (0.62 mi).

Soils in India can be classified into eight categories: alluvial, black, red, laterite, forest, arid and desert, saline and alkaline and peaty and organic soils. Alluvial soil constitute the largest soil group in India, constituting 80% of the total land surface. It is derived from the deposition of silt carried by rivers and are found in the Great Northern plains from Punjab to the Assam valley. Alluvial soil are generally fertile but they lack nitrogen and tend to be phosphoric. National Disaster Management Authority says that 60% of Indian landmass is prone to earthquakes and 8% susceptible to cyclone risks. Black soil are well developed in the Deccan lava region of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh. These contain high percentage of clay and are moisture retentive. Red soils are found in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka plateau, Andhra plateau, Chota Nagpur plateau and the Aravallis. These are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and humus. Laterite soils are formed in tropical regions with heavy rainfall. Heavy rainfall results in leaching out all soluble material of top layer of soil. These are generally found in Western ghats, Eastern ghats and hilly areas of northeastern states that receive heavy rainfall. Forest soils occur on the slopes of mountains and hills in Himalayas, Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats. These generally consist of large amounts of dead leaves and other organic matter called humus .
