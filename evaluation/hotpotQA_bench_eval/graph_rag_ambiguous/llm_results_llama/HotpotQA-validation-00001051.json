      "text": "Andrea Nguyen (born 1969) is a Vietnamese-born, American teacher, food writer, cookbook author and chef living in the San Francisco area. An expert on Asian cuisine and cooking methods, Nguyen has written numerous cookbooks on the food of her native Vietnam , as well as an account of her family's escape during the Fall of Saigon . Later in life, she turned to plant-based cooking. She writes an active blog, newsletter, as well as articles for newspapers and food magazines and teaches cooking classes throughout the country. She won a 2018 James Beard Foundation Award (Single Subject) for The Pho Cookbook . She also received two additional James Beard cookbook nominations: Into the Vietnamese Kitchen: Treasured Foodways, Modern Flavors (Best Asian, 2007) and Ever-Green Vietnamese: Super-Fresh Recipes, Starring Plants from Land and Sea (Vegetable-Focused Cooking, 2024). Early life Andrea Quynhgiao Nguyen was born in 1969 in Vietnam and fled with her family of seven when Saigon fell in 1975. Fleeing the communist regime , her family emigrated with only enough belongings for a vacation, but brought with them a notebook filled with her mother's recipes. They settled in Southern California and attempted to buy foods they were familiar with, but the dishes were mass-produced and not very tasty. Nguyen's mother suggested they replicate foods from their homeland, by making the dishes themselves. After a childhood spent in San Clemente , Nguyen attended the University of Southern California and graduated with a B.S. in banking and finance and M.A. in communication management. Career General cookbooks Upon completing her schooling, Nguyen first worked as a bank auditor and then a university administrator, while she and husband were living in Los Angeles before she began writing restaurant reviews. In 1997, she wrote her first book, an autobiographical tale, Trip to Freedom (1997) which was written to explain her family's migration and the events surrounding the decision to children. Nguyen wrote a letter to pitch an article on her mother's mooncakes to Saveur and they accepted it. She then developed her website and worked on a proposal for her first cookbook. She continued writing articles about the food of Vietnam in various newspapers and magazines, like the Los Angeles Times , Saveur, The Wall Street Journal , and Rodale's Organic Life . Starting fall 2017, she has had a monthly column in Cooking Light called \"The Teacher.\" Nguyen's first cookbook Into the Vietnamese Kitchen (2006) has been called \"indispensable\" for those wanting to cook Vietnamese foods, as Nguyen sees culinary history as integrally entwined with culture. Her detailed instructions were clear and precise with photographs and explanatory techniques provided in sidebar. It was a finalist in the 2007 James Beard Foundation Award , as best Asian cookbook and was nominated for best first book and best international cookbook by the International Association of Culinary Professionals that same",

Release and reception Black Beauty was originally released only in Japan in 1973. It contained four side -long tracks spread across a double album , grouping the songs as medleys titled \"Black Beauty Part I\", \"Black Beauty Part II\", and so on, all of which credited Davis as the composer. He did not want the actual segments specified on the track listing out of a distaste for critics and listeners who arduously analyzed his music; according to DeJohnette's wife Lydia, \"Miles really felt that critics and people spent too much time in their mental mind, analyzing and talking for hours about something that really just is.\" Columbia spent several years identifying some of the individual compositions to ensure royalty payment for the actual composers. The Japanese release also mistakenly credited Michael Henderson —Davis' other bassist during this period—rather than Holland in the liner notes . The record was only available in the United States as an import until 1997, when it was remastered on CD in 20- bit resolution and released by Legacy Recordings as a limited edition digipak . Robert Christgau reviewed the reissue that year in The Village Voice : Black Beauty preserved an inkling of why the jazz-rock idea seemed so auspicious before it found form in [fusion's] flash and filigree. Wailing through 'Directions' or blasting the blues from out 'Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,' Chick Corea's keybs sound more audacious and grounded than they ever will again, with an uncommonly muscular Miles challenging his facility and fledgling soprano whiz Steve Grossman mimicking it, and beyond a few dollops of needless noodle, Jack DeJohnette keeps the troops in order, injecting more notes and accents than Ginger Baker on double amphetamines into a beat that rocks. Yet this unique sound is evolving fast. Still nominally beholden to theme-and-variation , Black Beauty is soloists' music, and as such the corniest electric Miles on record. Davis biographer Jack Chambers was more critical, finding the sound quality and Grossman's performance poor, especially on the first disc, where he indulged in a \"nervous downpour of notes that is narrow in range and unimaginative\". In general, Chambers complained that the concert's largely improvised format was risky and inauspicious: \"It can inspire creative bridges and emotive playing melded into a spontaneous suite or degenerate into a babble of voices bogged down in search of the musical means to get from one theme to the next.\" In Tingen's opinion, the quality of the",

      "text": "G3 Prince Bass (2016) A guitar virtuoso, Prince was also known to have a stylish and flamboyant custom guitar collection, which consisted of 121 guitars. One notable series is his Cloud Guitars, which were commissioned and released in colored versions of white, yellow and purple. The white version is prominently shown in the Purple Rain film and the \"Raspberry Beret\" video. Other notable guitars are The Love Symbol guitars, which were designed in the separate colors of gold and purple. The guitar that was used for the majority of Prince's music career was the H.S. Anderson Madcat guitar – a Telecaster copy created by Hohner . Several versions of the guitar were used throughout his career – due to one being donated for charitable reasons, while one or more were stolen. Another guitar primarily used in his later years was the Vox HDC-77 , which was introduced to him by 3rdeyegirl member Ida Kristine Nielsen, both a Blackburst version, and a White Ivory version. Two other noteworthy guitars are the G1 Purple Special, and the black-and-gold Gus G3 Prince bass, which would become the last two guitars to ever be made for him. Legal issues Pseudonyms In 1993, during negotiations regarding the release of The Gold Experience , a legal battle ensued between Warner Bros. and Prince over the artistic and financial control of his musical output. During the lawsuit, Prince appeared in public with the word \"slave\" written on his cheek. He explained that he had changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol to emancipate himself from his contract with Warner Bros., and that he had done it out of frustration because he felt his own name now belonged to the company. Prince sometimes used pseudonyms to separate himself from the music he had written, produced or recorded, and at one point stated that his ownership and achievement were strengthened by the act of giving away ideas. Pseudonyms he adopted, at various times, include: Jamie Starr and The Starr Company (for the songs he wrote for the Time and many other artists from 1981 to 1984), Joey Coco (for many unreleased Prince songs in the late 1980s, as well as songs written for Sheena Easton and Kenny Rogers ), Alexander Nevermind (for writing the song \" Sugar Walls \"  by Sheena Easton), and Christopher (used for his songwriting credit of \"Manic Monday\"  for the Bangles). Copyright issues On September 14, 2007, Prince announced that he was going to sue YouTube and eBay , because they hosted his copyrighted material, and he hired the international Internet-policing company Web Sheriff . In October, Stephanie Lenz filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Publishing Group claiming that they were abusing copyright law after the music publisher had YouTube take down Lenz's home movie in which the Prince song \"Let's Go Crazy\" played faintly in the",

Louis would hear it and so when it came around the next time he would play it. I learned from Miles how these kind of cues can be used to change direction, or introduce a new section. Miles often used phrases to show us where we'd go next. When we were playing a tune, Miles would superimpose something on top of it, and as soon as he did that we'd know that we were moving to another song, or that this or that rhythmic thing was about to happen. That's the great thing about a working band, you start to develop an intuitive sense for what's going on. You're listening all the time and you build up this language which becomes very personal to the group. According to Los Angeles Times critic Don Heckman , the resulting textures heard in Black Beauty ' s music exhibited \"an almost pointillistic quality, with bits and pieces of sounds darting in and out of the overall texture, and Davis' trumpet skimming through the mix\". In Spin , Erik Davis highlighted Grossman's \"squonking sax\", Corea's \"nastily distorted\" keyboards, and Davis' \"milky, yearning, sometimes angry\" trumpet playing. Because they were playing around a preceding vamp or theme when Davis signaled the next, Tingen said the musical shifts heard on the record had the effect of post-production crossfades , similar to those used by producer Teo Macero on the studio recordings In a Silent Way (1969), Bitches Brew , and Jack Johnson . Macero claimed Davis conceived his onstage approach from him: \"It was because of me, because we always overlapped sections in our edits.\" \"Black Beauty Part IV\" A 30-second sample featuring the band's segue from \"Masqualero\" to \"Spanish Key\" Problems playing this file? See media help . Some of the songs, including \"I Fall in Love Too Easily\", \"Masqualero\", and \"The Theme\", were from Davis' 1950s and 1960s repertoire. \"The Theme\" was originally recorded in 1955 by his first great quintet and was used to close most of his concerts from the late 1950s to 1970, after which he began to favor \"Sanctuary\" as a closing number. \"Masqualero\" was performed in a similar rock-influenced fashion as the newer material, with DeJohnette and Holland carrying aggressive vamps and Corea playing distorted riffs on his electric piano. John Szwed believed the music paid homage to Davis' past, \"respecting space, solos, form, and fixed rhythms, though there are also hints throughout that [the band] will soon find some other way to organize this music to play it live.\" In Corea's opinion, the record was an accurate",

Ainslee's was published until December 1926, after which it was merged into Far West Illustrated , a western-fiction magazine. In 1934, Street & Smith revived Ainslee's Magazine as a \"sophisticated love-story monthly\" edited by Daisy Bacon . In 1936, the title changed to Ainslee’s Smart Love Stories , then finally Smart Love Stories . It was discontinued in 1938.

It was a finalist in the 2007 James Beard Foundation Award , as best Asian cookbook and was nominated for best first book and best international cookbook by the International Association of Culinary Professionals that same year. In March 2012, both Into the Vietnamese Kitchen and Nguyen's second cookbook, Asian Dumplings were selected as two of seven cookbooks honored in the Asian section of Cooking Light ′s Best 100 Cookbooks of the Past 25 Years Award. Asian Dumplings covered a wide array of dumplings from throughout Asia, dividing the recipes by dough and wrapping type. The detailed instructions included line drawings to demonstrate how to form the dough into traditional shapes, as well as sections on sauces , stocks , seasonings and ingredients and various cooking equipment needed to make the dishes. Asian Tofu (2012) was more than a guide to making tofu , as Nguyen included buying guides, as well as tips on selecting ready-made tofu. Her recipes featured both vegetarian and meat dishes, which could use either homemade or store-bought tofu and was noted as an \"essential\" guide. With The Banh Mi Handbook (2014), Nguyen added another layer to her history of cooking in Vietnam, showing how the marriage of French colonial staples, such as the baguette were combined with Asian pâtés , barbecue and pickles to create a \"delightful balance of tastes and textures\". Her 2017 book The Pho Cookbook explores variants in the dish, noting that traditionally pho was a simple, rustic soup, which mirrored the sensibility of Hanoi . As it made its way southward toward Saigon , the dish became sweeter and spicier and more cosmopolitan, with custom additions of sauces and herbs, representing the more capitalist influences of the commercialized south. In 2018, Nguyen won a James Beard Award (Single Subject) for The Pho Cookbook . Vietnamese Food Any Day (2019) presented recipes, techniques, and know-how to cooks to prepare dishes from American supermarket ingredients. No Asian market shopping was required. It has become the go-to cookbook for many people who crave Vietnamese food and want to fit it into their repertoire any day of the week.
