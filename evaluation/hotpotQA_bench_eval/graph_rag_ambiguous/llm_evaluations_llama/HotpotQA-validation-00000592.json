    "answer_correctness": 1.0,

    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Cedric the Entertainer as the comedian and provides the year 2005, matching the Gold Answer. However, the retrieved context does not explicitly mention Cedric hosting the Black Movie Awards in 2005, making the faithfulness to context partial. The evidence coverage is complete as the year 2005 is included."
