  "question": "A 1952 Western film set around a mountainous landmark follows the efforts of a band of irregular cavalry raiders fighting for which side of the American Civil War?",
  "gold_answer": "pro-Confederate",
  "llm_answer": "The answer cannot be determined with certainty from the provided context.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states 'pro-Confederate,' which is supported by the retrieved context mentioning Quantrill's Raiders as pro-Confederate guerrillas. The Model Answer incorrectly claims the answer cannot be determined, despite the context providing clear evidence. This results in a failure in correctness, faithfulness, and evidence coverage."
