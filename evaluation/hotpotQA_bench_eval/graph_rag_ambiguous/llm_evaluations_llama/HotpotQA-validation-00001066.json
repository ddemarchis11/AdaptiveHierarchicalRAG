    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not address the shared professional role between the New York poet and novelist and the Chicago-born film critic, which is 'author' as stated in the Gold Answer. While the information about Roger Ebert is accurate and grounded in the context, it fails to answer the specific question and misses the key fact from the Gold Answer."
