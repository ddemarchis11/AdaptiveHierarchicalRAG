    "explanation": "The model correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information relevant to the question about South Indian sister duos and Carnatic music. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge, which would have been appropriate given the lack of relevant context. The Gold Answer is 'Carnatic music,' but the model does not provide this information."
