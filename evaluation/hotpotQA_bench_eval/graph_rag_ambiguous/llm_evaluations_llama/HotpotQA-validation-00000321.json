    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct response to the question, which is the FIFA Women's World Cup. The retrieved context clearly supports this answer, as it mentions Liu Ailing's participation in the 1991, 1995, and 1999 editions of the FIFA Women's World Cup. The Model Answer does not utilize the context effectively and does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
