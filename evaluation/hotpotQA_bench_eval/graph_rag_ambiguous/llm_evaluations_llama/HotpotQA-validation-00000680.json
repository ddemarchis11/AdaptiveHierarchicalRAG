    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies 'Perfect Strangers' as the earlier comedy series from which 'Family Matters' was spun off. This is consistent with the Gold Answer and supported by the Retrieved Context, which explicitly states that 'Family Matters' was a spin-off of 'Perfect Strangers'. The Model Answer also includes the detail about 'Family Matters' being the sitcom where 3J appeared, which is relevant and accurate."
