In 1780, using a frog, he discovered that the muscles of dead frogs' legs twitched when struck by an electrical spark. This was an early study of bioelectricity , following experiments by John Walsh and Hugh Williamson . Early life and career Luigi Galvani was born to goldsmith Domenico Galvani and Barbara Caterina Foschi, in Bologna , then part of the Papal States . A portion of his childhood home still stands in the Giardino Salvatore Pincherle. In 1759, Galvani graduated with a degree in medicine and philosophy and began to practice medicine at nearby hospitals. He published his first work, a paper on the anatomy and physiology of bones, in 1762, when he was 25 years old. Galvani presented the work at the Archiginnasio di Bologna , which allowed him to start lecturing at the Academy of Sciences of the Institue of Bologna (now part of the University of Bologna ) where he taught anatomy for most of his career. In 1766, Galvani was appointed curator of the anatomical museum by the senate of Bologna. This position \"required him to give lectures and demonstrations of anatomical operations before surgeons, painters and sculptors.\" In 1782, he was appointed Professor of Obstetric Arts , which he remained for the next 16 years. Animal electricity Galvani then began taking an interest in the field of \"medical electricity\". This field emerged in the middle of the 18th century, following electrical researches and the discovery of the effects of electricity on the human body by scientists including Bertrand Bajon and Ramón María Termeyer in the 1760s, and by John Walsh and Hugh Williamson in the 1770s. The publication in 1791 of Galvani’s main work ( De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius ), summarizing and discussing more than 10 years of research on the effect of electricity on animal preparations, had an enormous impact on the scientific community and sparked heated controversy in Europe.

Biography Eusebio Valli's paternal house, Casciana Alta, Casciana Terme Lari, Pisa, Italy, decorated with a big commemorative marble plaque He was born in Casciana Alta, current district of the municipality of Casciana Terme Lari, Pisa, from an important Tuscan family originally from Ponsacco . His father was a distinguished physician named Giuseppe Valli and his mother was a woman named Anna Maria Jacoponi , whose family came from Casciana. When he was five years old he was taken by his family to Monterchi , where his father worked as a local doctor and where he was educated by a local teacher, Ignazio Chiaverini, who taught him Italian and Latin until the age of 16, in order to prepare him for academic studies. The economic situation of his family didn't allow him to apply to the University of Pisa , where Jacopo-Filippo, one of Eusebio's siblings, was already studying. For this reason, in 1771 his father found himself forced to send to Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor , Grand Duke of Tuscany , a letter in which he asked him to admit his son freely to the Collegio della Sapienza di Pisa (which later became today's Scuola Normale di Pisa ): Unfortunately there wasn't any vacant place there, so Eusebio, in order to contain familiar expenses, had to wait for his brother to graduate before being able to attend University . During his university years he stayed in a certain Mr. Domenico Cola 's house, in via Santa Maria, Pisa, while his uncle, Michelangelo Valli , acted as his guarantor . In 1783 he graduated in Medicine and Philosophy at the Collegio della Sapienza and in the following years he was called to work as a surgeon in various places. He went to Mantova where he was elected medico primario dello Spedal Civile and professor of Clinical Medicine. In Turkey , Greece and Egypt he studied the epidemiology of plague , smallpox and of a \"certain malignant putrid fever\" (probably malaria ). Valli subsequently travelled to Dalmatia as a military doctor with the Franco-Italian army. Eusebio followed in the footsteps of great masters such as Luigi Galvani from whom he learned the art of physiology , of which the latter was the spokesperson, and Alessandro Volta , whose influence led Valli to study phenomena like “animal electricity” or “bioelectricity”. Eusebio Valli is considered the forerunner of vaccination , in fact through his numerous studies he heralded one of the medical techniques still used today, and was",

Electrodes touch a frog, and the legs twitch into the upward position. (see also: Frog galvanoscope ) Galvani vs. Volta Alessandro Volta , a professor of experimental physics in the University of Pavia , was among the first scientists who repeated and checked Galvani’s experiments. At first, he embraced animal electricity. However, he started to doubt that the conductions were caused by specific electricity intrinsic to the animal's legs or other body parts. Volta believed that the contractions depended on the metal cable Galvani used to connect the nerves and muscles in his experiments. Every cell has a cell potential ; biological electricity has the same chemical underpinnings as the current between electrochemical cells , and thus can be duplicated outside the body. Volta's intuition was correct. Volta, essentially, objected to Galvani’s conclusions about \"animal electric fluid\", but the two scientists disagreed respectfully and Volta coined the term \"Galvanism\" for a direct current of electricity produced by chemical action. Since Galvani was reluctant to intervene in the controversy with Volta, he trusted his nephew, Giovanni Aldini , to act as the main defender of the theory of animal electricity. Personal life 1862 painting of Luigi Galvani and Lucia Galeazzi Galvani. Galvani married scientist Lucia Galeazzi , daughter of his mentor Domenico Gusmano Galeazzi , in 1762. After her death in 1790, Galvani moved in with his brother, who was living in their childhood home in Bologna. Galvani was described by contemporaries as an \"honest, mild, modest man, polite, charitable to the unfortunate and always a noble and generous friend.\" He was noted for his religious devotion and saw his medical work as being a spiritual mission. French dermatologist Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert said of Galvani that he never ended his lessons “without exhorting his hearers and leading them back to the idea of that eternal Providence, which develops, conserves, and circulates life among so many diverse beings.” Death and legacy Galvani actively investigated animal electricity until the end of his life. In April 1798, the Cisalpine Republic , a French client state founded after the French occupation of Northern Italy, required every university professor to swear loyalty to the new authority. Galvani disagreed with the oath and refused to take it; as a result, he was stripped of his offices and sent into poverty. Aldini led a movement to restore him to his university position — it was successful, but his restoration was only announced shortly before his death. Galvani died in his brother’s house on 4 December 1798. Luigi Galvani's monument in Piazza Luigi",

      "text": "In black hole theory, the membrane paradigm is a simplified model, useful for visualising and calculating the effects predicted by quantum mechanics for the exterior physics of black holes, without using quantum-mechanical principles or calculations. It models a black hole as a thin, classically radiating surface (or membrane ) at or vanishingly close to the black hole's event horizon . This approach to the theory of black holes was created by Thibault Damour , Kip S. Thorne , R. H. Price and D. A. Macdonald. Electrical resistance Thorne (1994) relates that this approach to studying black holes was prompted by the realisation by Hanni, Ruffini , Wald and Cohen in the early 1970s that since an electrically charged pellet dropped into a black hole should still appear to a distant outsider to be remaining just outside the event horizon, if its image persists, its electrical fieldlines ought to persist too, and ought to point to the location of the \"frozen\" image (1994, pp. 406). If the black hole rotates, and the image of the pellet is pulled around, the associated electrical fieldlines ought to be pulled around with it to create basic \"electrical dynamo\" effects ( see: dynamo theory ). Further calculations yielded properties for a black hole such as apparent electrical resistance (pp. 408). Since these fieldline properties seemed to be exhibited down to the event horizon, and general relativity insisted that no dynamic exterior interactions could extend through the horizon, it was considered convenient to invent a surface at the horizon that these electrical properties could be said to belong to. Hawking radiation After being introduced to model the theoretical electrical characteristics of the horizon, the membrane approach was then pressed into service to model the Hawking radiation effect predicted by quantum mechanics . In the coordinate system of a distant stationary observer, Hawking radiation tends to be described as a quantum-mechanical particle- pair production effect (involving virtual particles ), but for stationary observers hovering nearer to the hole, the effect is supposed to look like a purely conventional radiation effect involving real particles [ why? ] . In the membrane paradigm , the black hole is described as it should be seen by an array of these stationary, suspended noninertial observers, and since their shared coordinate system ends at the event horizon (because an observer cannot legally hover at or below the event horizon under general relativity), this conventional-looking radiation is described as being emitted by an arbitrarily thin shell of hot material at or just above the event horizon, where this coordinate system fails. As in the electrical case, the membrane paradigm is useful because these effects should appear all the way down to the event horizon, but are not allowed by GR to be coming through the horizon – attributing them to a hypothetical thin radiating membrane at the horizon allows them to be modeled classically without explicitly contradicting general relativity's prediction that the event horizon is",

Influence and reception Foucault's works have exercised a powerful influence over numerous humanistic and social scientific disciplines as one of the most influential and controversial scholars of the post-World War II period. According to a London School of Economics ' analysis in 2016, his works Discipline and Punish and The History of Sexuality were among the 25 most cited books in the social sciences of all time, at just over 100,000 citations. In 2007, Foucault was listed as the single most cited scholar in the humanities by the ISI Web of Science among a large quantity of French philosophers, the compilation's author commenting that \"What this says of modern scholarship is for the reader to decide—and it is imagined that judgments will vary from admiration to despair, depending on one's view\". According to Gary Gutting , Foucault's \"detailed historical remarks on the emergence of disciplinary and regulatory biopower have been widely influential\". Leo Bersani wrote that: \"[Foucault] is our most brilliant philosopher of power. More originally than any other contemporary thinker, he has attempted to define the historical constraints under which we live, at the same time that he has been anxious to account for—if possible, even to locate—the points at which we might resist those constraints and counter some of the moves of power. In the present climate of cynical disgust with the exercise of political power, Foucault's importance can hardly be exaggerated.\" Foucault's work on \"biopower\" has been widely influential within the disciplines of philosophy and political theory , particularly for such authors as Giorgio Agamben , Roberto Esposito , Antonio Negri , and Michael Hardt . His discussions on power and discourse have inspired many critical theorists , who believe that Foucault's analysis of power structures could aid the struggle against inequality. They claim that through discourse analysis , hierarchies may be uncovered and questioned by way of analyzing the corresponding fields of knowledge through which they are legitimated. This is one of the ways that Foucault's work is linked to critical theory. His work Discipline and Punish influenced his friend and contemporary Gilles Deleuze , who published the paper \"Postscript on the Societies of Control\", praising Foucault's work but arguing that contemporary western society has in fact developed from a 'disciplinary society' into a 'society of control'. Deleuze went on to publish a book dedicated to Foucault's thought in 1988 under the title Foucault . Foucault's discussions of the relationship between power and knowledge has influenced postcolonial critiques in explaining the discursive formation of colonialism , particularly",

He died in Havana in September 1816 after not injecting enough attenuated germs into his own body. After his death, numerous streets and squares have been dedicated to the great Eusebio Valli in Tuscany, and two large marble plaques commemorate him respectively in his birthplace in Casciana Alta and in his paternal house in Ponsacco.

Scientific activity Luigi Galvani Eusebio Valli's passion for physics and chemistry , applied to the human body, led him to conduct numerous studies and multiple discoveries. In 1781, he discovered the anti- fermentation action of the red precipitate in wine preparation. During his stays in the Middle East and Asia Minor , Valli worked out a theory according to which the etiopathogenetic development of the plague required the so-called “principle of affinity”, that is to say, a sort of predisposition to the disease. “ The forces that it deploys in the various subjects depend more on the constitution of each individual than on the character of the miasma ”. In his Discorso sopra il sangue considerato in stato di sanità e di malattia ( Discourse on blood in the state of health and of disease ), Valli claimed that alterations in haematological parameters were not due to the influence of humoral agents, but of solid agents.

Luigi Galvani, one of Eusebio's leading figures, published some applications of various metals to frogs, and this prompted a large number of other Italian scientists to share and discuss these researches. Eusebio Valli was the first of these to divulge these discoveries, and furthermore, he wrote that his study had \"prevented him from sleeping for many nights\". Valli became a respected exponent in this field throughout Europe; he gave public lectures on Galvani's experiments and published articles on this topic in various Italian and foreign cities, including Lausanne , Paris , London . In 1793 he published a volume of 300 pages entitled Esperimenti sull'elettricità animale ( Experiments on animal electricity ), which at the time constituted one of the most organic analyses of all the problems of galvanism .

In 2006, Ebert noted his own \"tendency to place what I now consider the year's best film in second place, perhaps because I was trying to make some kind of point with my top pick,\" adding, \"In 1968, I should have ranked 2001 above The Battle of Algiers .
