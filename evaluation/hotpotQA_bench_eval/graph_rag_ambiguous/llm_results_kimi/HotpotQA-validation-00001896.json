      "text": "Konstantīns Raudive (30 April 1909 in Asūne , Vitebsk Governorate – 2 September 1974), known internationally as Konstantin Raudive , was a Latvian writer and parapsychologist, and husband of Zenta Mauriņa . Raudive was born in Latgale in eastern Latvia (then part of Vitebsk Governorate ) but studied extensively abroad, later becoming a student of Carl Jung . In exile following the Soviet re-occupation of Latvia in 1944 , he taught at the University of Uppsala in Sweden . Raudive studied parapsychology all his life, and was especially interested in the possibility of the afterlife . He and German parapsychologist Hans Bender investigated electronic voice phenomena (EVP). He published a book on EVP, Breakthrough , in 1971. Raudive was a scientist as well as a practising Roman Catholic . EVP research In 1964, Raudive read Friedrich Jürgenson 's book, Voices from Space , and was so impressed by it that he arranged to meet Jürgenson in 1965. He then worked with Jürgenson to make some EVP recordings, but their first efforts bore little fruit, although they believed that they could hear very weak, muddled voices. According to Raudive, however, one night, as he listened to one recording, he clearly heard a number of voices. When he played the tape over and over, he came to believe he understood all of them. He thought some of which were in German, some in Latvian , some in French . The last voice on the tape, according to Raudive, a woman's voice, said \" Ve a dormir, Margarete \" (\"Go to sleep, Margaret\"). Raudive later wrote (in his book Breakthrough ): These words made a deep impression on me, as Margarete Petrautzki had died recently, and her illness and death had greatly affected me. Raudive started researching such alleged voices on his own and spent much of the last ten years of his life exploring EVP. With the help of various electronics experts, he recorded over 100,000 audiotapes, most of which were made under what he described as \"strict laboratory conditions.\" He collaborated at times with Bender. Over 400 people were involved in his research, and all apparently heard the voices. This culminated in the 1968 publication of Unhörbares wird hörbar (“What is inaudible becomes audible”) . The book was published in English in 1971 as Breakthrough . Methods Raudive developed several different approaches to recording EVP: Microphone voices: one simply leaves the tape recorder running, with no one talking; he indicated that one can even disconnect the microphone. Radio voices: one records the white noise from a radio that is not",

      "text": "The expression \" macaroni and cheese \" is an example of irreversible binomial. The order of the two keywords of this familiar expression are normally not reversed. In linguistics and stylistics , an irreversible binomial , frozen binomial , binomial freeze , binomial expression , binomial pair , or nonreversible word pair is a pair of words, used together, in fixed order, as an idiomatic expression or collocation . The words typically have a semantic relationship, usually involving the word and or or . They also belong to the same part of speech : for example: nouns (e.g., milk and honey ); adjectives ( short and sweet ); or verbs ( do or die ). Usually (as with the preceding examples) the order of such word elements will not be reversed. The term \"irreversible binomial\" was introduced by Yakov Malkiel in 1954, though various aspects of the phenomenon had been discussed, since at least 1903, under different names: a \"terminological imbroglio\". Ernest Gowers used the name Siamese twins (i.e., conjoined twins ) in the 1965 edition of Fowler's Modern English Usage . The 2015 edition reverts to the scholarly name, \"irreversible binomials\", as \"Siamese twins\" had become \" politically incorrect \". Many irreversible binomials are catchy due to alliteration , rhyming , or ablaut reduplication , so becoming clichés or catchphrases . Idioms like rock and roll , the birds and the bees , and collocations like mix and match , and wear and tear have particular meanings apart from or beyond those of their constituent words. Ubiquitous collocations like loud and clear and life or death are fixed expressions , making them a standard part of the vocabulary of native English speakers. Some English words have become obsolete in general but are still found in an irreversible binomial. For example, spick is a fossil word that never appears outside the phrase spick and span . Some other words, like vim in vim and vigor or abet in aid and abet , have become rare and archaic outside the collocation. Numerous irreversible binomials are used in legalese . Due to the use of precedent in common law , many lawyers use the same collocations found in legal documents centuries old. Many of these legal doublets contain two synonyms, often one of Old English origin and the other of Latin origin: deposes and says , ways and means . While many irreversible binomials are literal expressions (like washer and dryer, rest and relaxation, rich and famous, savings and loan ), some are entirely figurative (like come hell or high water, nip and tuck, surf and turf ) or mostly so (like between a rock and a hard place, five and dime ). Somewhat in between are more subtle figures of speech , synecdoches , metaphors , or hyperboles (like",

Another electronic device specifically constructed in an attempt to capture EVP is \"Frank's Box\" or the \"Ghost Box\", created in 2002 by EVP enthusiast Frank Sumption for supposed real-time communication with the dead. Sumption claims he received his design instructions from the spirit world. The device is described as a combination white noise generator and AM radio receiver modified to sweep back and forth through the AM band selecting split-second snippets of sound. Critics of the device say its effect is subjective and incapable of being replicated, and since it relies on radio noise, any meaningful response a user gets is purely coincidental, or simply the result of pareidolia . Paranormal researcher Ben Radford writes that Frank's Box is a \"modern version of the Ouija board ... also known as the 'broken radio'\". Interest in the 21st century and late 20th century In 1982, Sarah Estep founded the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena (AA-EVP) in Severna Park, Maryland , a nonprofit organization with the purpose of increasing awareness of EVP, and of teaching standardized methods for capturing it. Estep began her exploration of EVP in 1976, and says she has made hundreds of recordings of messages from deceased friends, relatives, and extraterrestrials whom she speculated originated from other planets or dimensions. The term Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC) was coined by Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s to refer more generally to communication through any sort of electronic device such as tape recorders, fax machines, television sets or computers between spirits or other discarnate entities and the living. One particularly famous claimed incidence of ITC occurred when the image of EVP enthusiast Friedrich Jürgenson (whose funeral was held that day) was said to have appeared on a television in the home of a colleague, which had been purposefully tuned to a vacant channel. ITC enthusiasts also look at the TV and video camera feedback loop of the Droste effect . In 1979, parapsychologist D. Scott Rogo described an alleged paranormal phenomenon in which people report that they receive simple, brief, and usually single-occurrence telephone calls from spirits of deceased relatives, friends, or strangers. Rosemary Guiley has written \"within the parapsychology establishment, Rogo was often faulted for poor scholarship, which, critics said, led to erroneous conclusions.\" In 1995, the parapsychologist David Fontana proposed in an article that poltergeists could haunt tape recorders. He speculated that this may have happened to the parapsychologist Maurice Grosse who investigated the Enfield Poltergeist case. However, Tom Flynn, a media expert for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry , examined Fontana's article and suggested an entirely naturalistic explanation for the phenomena.

The rank is usually the lowest ranking non-commissioned officer . In some militaries, the rank of corporal nominally corresponds to commanding a section or squad of soldiers. The word is a contraction from the medieval Italian phrase capo corporale ( transl. head of a body [of soldiers]). While most Indo-European languages use this contraction, West Iberian languages use cabo . NATO code While the rank is used in a number of NATO countries , it is ranked differently depending on the country. Types Lance corporal Korporal First corporal Second corporal Master corporal Corporal major Corporal of horse Corporal of the field Staff corporal By country Australia Corporal is the second lowest of the non-commissioned officer ranks in the Australian Army , falling between lance-corporal and sergeant . A corporal is usually appointed as a section commander, and is in charge of 7–14 soldiers of private rank. They are assisted by a second-in-command, usually a lance-corporal or senior private. A Corporal within Artillery is known as a bombardier . Corporal is also a rank of the Royal Australian Air Force , being equal to both the Australian Army and Royal Air Force rank of corporal. Belgium The branches of the Belgian Armed Forces use three ranks of corporal: corporal ( Dutch : korporaal , French : caporal ), master corporal ( Dutch : korporaal-chef , French : caporal-chef ) and 1st master corporal ( Dutch : 1ste korporaal-chef , French : 1e caporal-chef ). Corporal is equivalent to NATO Rank Code OR-3 , whereas master corporal and 1st master corporal are equivalent to OR-4. The rank immediately below corporal is 1st private and the rank directly above 1st master corporal is sergeant . Units with a cavalry, artillery or Logistic Corps (Transport unit) tradition replace Corporal by \"Brigadier\". The equivalent of these ranks in the Naval Component are quartermaster , chief quartermaster and 1st chief quartermaster. Canada Corporal is an Army and Air Force non-commissioned member rank of the Canadian Armed Forces . Its naval equivalent is sailor 1st class . It is senior to the rank of private and its naval equivalent sailor 2nd class , and junior to master corporal ( caporal-chef ) and its equivalent master sailor ( matelot-chef ). It is part of the cadre of junior non-commissioned officers , and one of the junior ranks. In French, the rank is caporal .

However, Tom Flynn, a media expert for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry , examined Fontana's article and suggested an entirely naturalistic explanation for the phenomena. According to the skeptical investigator Joe Nickell \"Occasionally, especially with older tape and under humid conditions, as the tape travels it can adhere to one of the guide posts. When this happens on a deck where both supply and take-up spindles are powered, the tape continues to feed, creating a fold. It was such a loop of tape, Flynn theorizes, that threaded its way amid the works of Grosse's recorder.\" In 1997, Imants Barušs , of the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, conducted a series of experiments using the methods of EVP investigator Konstantin Raudive , and the work of \"instrumental transcommunication researcher\" Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either sat in silence or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP. Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: \"While we did replicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena found in our study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence we have failed to replicate EVP in the strong sense.\" The findings were published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration in 2001, and include a literature review. In 2005, the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research published a report by paranormal investigator Alexander MacRae. MacRae conducted recording sessions using a device of his own design that generated EVP. In an attempt to demonstrate that different individuals would interpret EVP in the recordings the same way, MacRae asked seven people to compare some selections to a list of five phrases he provided, and to choose the best match. MacRae said the results of the listening panels indicated that the selections were of paranormal origin. Portable digital voice recorders are currently the technology of choice for some EVP investigators. Since some of these devices are very susceptible to Radio Frequency (RF) contamination, EVP enthusiasts sometimes try to record EVP in RF- and sound-screened rooms. Some EVP enthusiasts describe hearing the words in EVP as an ability, much like learning a new language. Skeptics suggest that the claimed instances may be misinterpretations of natural phenomena, inadvertent influence of the electronic equipment by researchers, or deliberate influencing of the researchers and the equipment by third parties. EVP and ITC are seldom researched within the scientific community , so most research in the field is carried out",

VLCD is used for clinical purposes since at least the 1980s. In 1978, 58 people died in the United States after following very-low-calorie liquid protein diets. Following this event, the FDA requires since 1984 that protein VLCDs providing fewer than 400 calories a day carry a warning that they can cause serious illness and need to be followed under medical supervision. However, newer regulations require this warning only on protein products that aim to provide more than half of a person's calories and are promoted for weight loss or as a food supplement . This enabled protein VLCD drinks such as Slim-Fast that provide fewer than 400 calories to avoid warnings by recommending that users \"also eat one sensible meal each day\". In 1991, the Federal Trade Commission charged three liquid VLCD companies, Optifast, Medifast and Ultrafast, with deceptive advertising. The case was settled after the companies agreed to stop using what the FTC alleged to be deceptive claims about the long-term results and the safety of these diets.

Historically, VLCDs have evolved from early starvation experiments to clinically regulated programs, with safety guidelines now requiring medical supervision due to past fatalities and deceptive marketing practices.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nVLCD, rapid weight loss, medical supervision, total diet replacement, bariatric surgery",
