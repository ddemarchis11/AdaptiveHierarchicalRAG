      "text": "Weight for Age ( WFA ) is a term in thoroughbred horse racing which is one of the conditions for a race. History The principle of WFA was developed by Admiral Rous , a handicapper with the English Jockey Club . Rous experimented with weights until he arrived at a relationship between age and maturity, expressed in terms of weight. His original scale has undergone only minor alterations since his work in the 1860s. Description Weight for age means that a horse will carry a set weight in accordance with the Weight for Age Scale. This weight varies depending on the horse's age, its sex, the race distance and the month of the racing season. Weight for age races are usually Group 1 races, races of the highest quality. It is a form of handicapping for horse racing , but within the horse racing industry is not referred to as handicap, which is reserved for more general handicapping. WFA is a method of trying to equal out the physical progress which the average thoroughbred racehorse makes as it matures. By the age of two the thoroughbred horse has achieved 95% of its mature height and weight, and by the end of its third year it will be fully mature. To allow for this variation in maturity in the context of racing, it is necessary to express it as a function of the weight a horse will carry in a race. It is also necessary to take into account the race distance because stamina comes with maturity, and younger horses are at a greater disadvantage the farther they have to run. If no allowance was made, a mature older horse would always beat a younger one.

Unraced as a two-year-old, he showed promising form in Britain in 2011 before being sold to race in Hong Kong. He continued to show useful but unexceptional form before emerging as a dominant middle-distance performer in the early part of 2013, winning the January Cup , Hong Kong Gold Cup , Premier Plate , Queen Elizabeth II Cup and Singapore Airlines International Cup . In July 2013 at the Hong Kong Jockey Club Champion Awards , he won three awards including the title of Hong Kong Horse of the Year . Background Military Attack is a bay gelding with a white coronet on his left hind foot, bred in Ireland by P E Banahan at the Moortown Stud in County Meath . He was from the second crop of foals sired by Oratorio , an Irish racehorse best known for his wins in the Eclipse Stakes and the Irish Champion Stakes in 2005. His dam Almaaseh was a daughter of the Irish 1000 Guineas winner Al Bahathri , making her a half-sister of the 2000 Guineas winner Haafhd . As a yearling the colt was consigned by the Moortown Stud to the Goff's sale where he was bought for €40,000 by a partnership involving the trainer John Hills. The colt was named Rave and was trained by Hills at Lambourn in Berkshire . Racing career 2011: three-year-old season Rave was beaten in his first two races in the spring of 2011 before recording his first success in a one-mile maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 28 May. After finishing second at Ayr Racecourse, Rave won two one mile handicap races at Ascot Racecourse in July. After his final British race Rave was sold privately and was exported to race in Hong Kong where he was trained by John Moore . He was gelded and renamed Military Attack. Military Attack usually races in a red hood and a black shadow roll . 2011/2102: four-year-old season Military Track did not run until February 2012 when he won his Hong Kong debut. He then finished sixth, beaten less than two lengths, behind Fay Fay in the Hong Kong Derby at Sha Tin Racecourse . Three month later he started favourite for a handicap at Happy Valley Racecourse but was beaten in a three-way photo finish by Happy Guys and Pure Champion. 2012/2013: five-year-old season In the early part of the 2012/2013 season, Military Attack showed promise when finishing fourth to Ambitious Dragon over one mile and fifth to California Memory in the Hong Kong Cup .

Irish measure or plantation measure was a system of units of land measurement used in Ireland from the 16th century plantations until the 19th century, with residual use into the 20th century. The units were based on \" English measure \" but used a linear perch measuring 7 yards (6.4 m) as opposed to the English rod of 5.5 yards (5.0 m). Thus, linear units such as the furlong and mile , which were defined in terms of perches, were longer by a factor of 14:11 (~27% more) in Irish measure, while units of area, such as the rood or acre , were larger by 196:121 (~62% more). The Weights and Measures Act 1824 ( 5 Geo. 4 . c. 74) mandated the use throughout the British Empire of \" Imperial measure \", also called \"statute measure\", based on English measure. Imperial measure soon replaced Irish measure in the use of the Dublin Castle administration , but Irish measure persisted in local government, and longer still in private use. History The size of the mile and acre are derived from the length of the surveyor's rod , a unit which in Ireland was called a perch (or linear perch to distinguish it from the square perch ). A mile is 320 linear perches and an acre is 160 square perches. The length of the perch was not standardised nationwide at the time of the Tudor conquest of Ireland ; the city walls of Cork used a 29-foot perch. The 21-foot perch which became standard in Ireland during the Plantations was found elsewhere; in 1820 it was reportedly used for linear measure in Guernsey , and for measuring fencing in Herefordshire and \"labourer's work\" in South Wales .

Leaders and sachems like Passaconaway played important roles in organizing long-distance kin and trade networks with allied neighbors (his own children were all married to the children of allied political leaders). Before the major epidemics of the 16th and 17th century would kill 90% of the Pennacook population, the Merrimack Valley and its tributaries like the Souhegan, Piscataquog, and Suncook, would have been densely populated, the environment carefully maintained. David Stewart-Smith (1998:19) estimated that the Merrimack Valley had 8,000–25,000 people before the epidemics, with a median of around 16,500 for the central area around Pennacook. The major and permanent Pennacook towns and villages were built along the major rivers, and many were on the east side of the Merrimack, ostensibly for protection from the west. Life revolved around the seasons, and spring would begin with women collecting maple sap to make maple sugar. Men would return to hunting grounds and burn their grounds to turn over nutrients in the soils for later cultivation. In late spring the rivers and creeks would swell as the great fish like salmon and shad made their way up the Merrimack. Many Pennacook villages were built just above natural waterfalls that trapped fish and made it easier to catch them in the late spring. Fiddlehead season would be followed by others still known today, like blueberry and raspberry seasons. During the summers, families would disperse to summer villages and hunting camps. Women did most of the work of building and maintaining homes as well as farming. Their main crops were varieties of maize/corn and squash, which they planted along rivers and in meadows. While they found it difficult to clear the massive old-growth trees, the Pennacook were experts at manipulating beavers to move their dams and ponds up and down creeks and brooks, thereby clearing and opening up land for farms that would be essential to the first Europeans who arrived and found cleared fields ready for cultivation. Many of these fields were scattered with the bones of the Pennacook who had recently died of smallpox or other diseases. The fall was an important hunting and nut harvesting season (butternuts, hickory nuts, black walnuts, and beech nuts were all tasty, and several southern, fire-resistant species were propagated farther north when possible). The presence of southern, fire-resistant species of nut trees like hickories and black walnuts in New Hampshire today is thanks to the Pennacook. The forests would generally be burned again in the late fall before families returned to the more permanent winter camps to wait out the long winter. In addition to being farmers, hunters, and foragers, it is important to remember that the Pennacook and the peoples of the Merrimack River Valley were also long-distance traders, and their major towns",

The overnight train takes about 19 1 ⁄ 2 hours to complete its 934-mile (1,503 km) route, making major stops in Champaign–Urbana , Carbondale , Memphis , and Jackson as well as in other small towns. The City of New Orleans was first initiated by the Illinois Central Railroad in 1947 as the daytime complement to the Panama Limited , a night train dating back to 1911. In 1971 both routes were conveyed to Amtrak, which retained only the Panama Limited . In 1981 Amtrak revived the City of New Orleans name for the train, still on an overnight schedule, on the heels of the popular song of the same name by Steve Goodman . Additional corridor service on the northern segment of the route is provided by the Illini and Saluki between Chicago and Carbondale, Illinois. The City of New Orleans is the only Amtrak train to serve Tennessee . During fiscal year 2023, the train carried 233,876 passengers, an increase of 50.3% from FY2022. In FY2016, the last year that route-specific revenue data was given, the train had a total revenue of $ 18,706,915, a 3.7% decrease from FY2015. History Illinois Central IC #4017, an EMD E7 , leads the City of New Orleans at Kankakee, Illinois in August 1964. The Illinois Central Railroad introduced the original City of New Orleans on April 27, 1947. It was a daytime, all-coach companion to the overnight Panama Limited , which had been all- Pullman for most of its run. EMD E7 diesel locomotives pulled new lightweight Pullman Company coaches. The 921-mile (1,482 km) route, which the City of New Orleans covered in 15 hours 55 minutes, was the longest daytime schedule in the United States. The City of New Orleans exchanged St. Louis —New Orleans through cars at Carbondale, Illinois and Louisville —New Orleans cars at Fulton, Kentucky . The average speed of the new train was nearly 60 mph (97 km/h) with a maximum of 100 mph (160 km/h); a result of the largely flat route of the Illinois Central along the Mississippi River . By October 25, 1959, the timetable had lengthened to 16 hours 30 minutes. The train remained popular throughout the 1960s and gained ex- Missouri Pacific Railroad dome coaches in 1967. Amtrak City of New Orleans , October 2005 When Amtrak assumed operation of U.S. passenger train service on May 1, 1971, it dropped the Panama Limited in favor of retaining the City of New Orleans on the traditional daytime schedule.

Although the 1824 Weights and Measures Act imposed imperial (statute) units, Irish measure persisted in local surveys, milestones, property deeds, and even some Acts of Parliament, producing legal and practical confusion well into the 20th century.
