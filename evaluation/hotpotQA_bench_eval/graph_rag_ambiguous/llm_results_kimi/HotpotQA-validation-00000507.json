The fellows rejected this, not just because Farmer was reputedly a Catholic and had a tarnished reputation, but also as he was not a fellow of the college, and therefore ineligible under the statutes. The fellows elected instead one of their own, John Hough . James eventually offered a compromise candidate in the form of the moderate Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Parker , but he too was rejected by the fellows as they considered the role filled. Parker was admitted by force and the fellows and demies who had defied the king were expelled, replaced by the king's choice of Catholics or moderate Anglicans. Parker died in 1688 and was replaced by Bonaventure Giffard , a Catholic under whose tenure the Chapel converted to Catholicism. The expulsion of the fellows marked a turning point in the university's relationship with the Crown: Brockliss writes, \"the royalist and Anglican University established at the Restoration had had to make a choice and it had chosen Anglicanism.\" James' interference with the college fed resentment in Anglicans who used it as evidence that his rule was autocratic. On 25 October 1688, shortly before the Glorious Revolution and overthrow of James II by William of Orange , James' appointments were reversed and Hough and the expelled fellows were restored to the college. This event is marked every year at a special banquet, the Restoration Dinner, for Magdalen fellows, demies, and academic clerks. 20th–21st centuries Magdalen's prominence since the mid-20th century owes much to such famous fellows as C. S. Lewis and A. J. P. Taylor , and its academic success to the work of such dons as Thomas Dewar Weldon . During World War II , RAF Maintenance Command was headquartered at Magdalen. Magdalen College owns and manages the Oxford Science Park to the south of Oxford, a science and technology park home to over 100 companies. The Oxford Science Park opened in 1991, with Magdalen as part owner. The college acquired total ownership in 2016, before selling 40% of its stake in 2021 for £160 million. It was reported that this sale will more than double the size of Magdalen's endowment fund, and make it \"probably the richest of Oxford's 39 colleges\". Like many of Oxford's colleges, Magdalen admitted its first mixed-sex cohort in 1979, after more than half a millennium as a men-only institution. Between 2015 and 2017, 47.2% of UK undergraduates admitted to Magdalen were from state schools; 12.2% were of BME (\"black and ethnic minority\") heritage and 0.7% were black.

The college's name is pronounced like the adjective maudlin because the late medieval English name of Mary Magdalene was Maudelen, derived from the Old French Madelaine. English Civil War De Gomme 's plan of Oxford's Civil War-era defences, 1644, shows Dover's Speare and other defences built around college grounds. Oxford and Magdalen College were supporters of the Royalist cause during the English Civil War . In 1642, Magdalen College donated over 296 lbs of plate (ie. silver or gold utensils or dishes) to fund the war effort – the largest donation by weight of any Oxford college. Magdalen College, commanding a position on the banks of the Cherwell that overlooked Magdalen Bridge and the road from London, had tactical significance for the King's forces. From 1643 to 1645, Magdalen's Grove was occupied by the Royalist ordnance, and Prince Rupert is thought to have quartered in the college. The city built fortifications in preparation for siege through Magdalen's grounds, including Dover's Speare (or Pier), a bastion that would have allowed observation to the north and east of the city. The earthworks where it was located, in the Water Meadow where the Cherwell forks, are still apparent today. Further fortifications and earthworks were built to protect the Holywell Ford site to the north. During the first Siege of Oxford , Charles I surveyed the battle from Magdalen Tower . Following the capitulation of Oxford to Thomas Fairfax at the end of the First English Civil War, Parliament ordered a Visitation to Oxford to purge Fellows for political and religious reasons. In 1647, the Visitors removed the then-president of Magdalen John Oliver and appointed instead one of their number, John Wilkinson , a former Principal of Magdalen Hall who had previously run unsuccessfully for the position of President at the college. When they refused to submit to the authority of Parliament, around 28 of the fellows, 21 of the demies (scholars), and all but one of the servants were also expelled. With the Royalists finally removed, the college would host Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell in 1649. After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 John Oliver was reappointed to the college, followed by 17 fellows and eight demies.

      "text": "Philosophia et septem artes liberales , \"philosophy and the seven liberal arts\". From the Hortus deliciarum of Herrad of Landsberg (12th century). Liberal arts education (from Latin liberalis ' free ' and ars ' art or principled practice ' ) is a traditional academic course in Western higher education, which traditionally covers the natural sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. Liberal arts takes the term art in the sense of a learned skill rather than specifically the fine arts . Liberal arts education can refer to studies in a liberal arts degree course or to a university education more generally. Such a course of study contrasts with those that are principally vocational , professional, or technical, as well as religiously based courses. The term liberal arts for an educational curriculum dates back to classical antiquity in the West, but has changed in meaning considerably, mostly expanding it. The seven subjects in the ancient and medieval meaning came to be divided into the trivium of rhetoric , grammar , and logic , and the quadrivium of astronomy , arithmetic , geometry , and music . However, there are hundreds of modern disciplines of study that now support modern professions and are traditionally recognised as liberal arts throughout academia. Some of the most popular liberal arts disciplines include: Anthropology , English , Literature , Fine arts , Foreign languages, Philosophy , Psychology , Sociology , Music , Journalism , Economics , Law , Communications , Architecture , Creative arts , Art , and History , and the Formal and Natural Sciences . Degrees in Liberal studies are often confused with those in a liberal arts discipline. Liberal studies refers to degrees with a broad curriculum, across multiple liberal arts disciplines and/or sciences and technologies. Apart from the sciences, enrollment in liberal arts degree programs has been declining in the 2010s and 2020s in the United States, in part because of a perception of worse job prospects. As of 2023, liberal arts degrees holders in the United States had a median wage of US$60,000, as opposed to $70,000 for all degree holders. As a result, liberal arts colleges and schools are popularly rebranding themselves as more vague and encompassing areas of study, such as arts and social sciences , arts and sciences and humanities . History Before they became known by their Latin variations ( artes liberales , septem artes liberales , studia liberalia ), the liberal arts were the continuation of Ancient Greek methods of inquiry that began with a \"desire for a universal understanding.\" Pythagoras argued that there was a mathematical (and geometric) harmony to the cosmos or the universe; his followers linked the four arts of astronomy , arithmetic , geometry , and music into one area of study to form the \"disciplines of the mediaeval quadrivium \". In the 4th-century-BC Athens, the government of the polis , or city-state, respected the ability of rhetoric or public speaking above almost everything",

Thus, on the level of higher education, despite the European origin of the liberal arts college, the term liberal arts college usually denotes liberal arts colleges in the United States .  With the exception of pioneering institutions such as Franklin University Switzerland (formerly known as Franklin College), established as a Europe-based, US-style liberal arts college in 1969, only recently some efforts have been undertaken to systematically \"re-import\" liberal arts education to continental Europe, as with Leiden University College The Hague , University College Utrecht , University College Maastricht , Amsterdam University College , Roosevelt Academy (now University College Roosevelt), University College Twente (ATLAS), Erasmus University College , the University of Groningen , Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts , Leuphana University of Lüneburg , Central European University , and Bard College Berlin , formerly known as the European College of Liberal Arts . Central European University launched a liberal arts undergraduate degree in Culture, Politics, and Society in 2020 as part of its move to Vienna and accreditation in Austria. As well as the colleges listed above, some universities in the Netherlands offer bachelors programs in Liberal Arts and Sciences ( Tilburg University ). Liberal arts (as a degree program) is just beginning to establish itself in Europe. For example, University College Dublin offers the degree, as does St. Marys University College Belfast , both institutions coincidentally on the island of Ireland. In the Netherlands, universities have opened constituent liberal arts colleges under the terminology university college since the late 1990s. The four-year bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Freiburg is the first of its kind in Germany. It started in October 2012 with 78 students. The first Liberal Arts degree program in Sweden was established at Gothenburg University in 2011, followed by a Liberal Arts Bachelor Programme at Uppsala University 's Campus Gotland in the autumn of 2013. The first Liberal Arts program in Georgia was introduced in 2005 by American-Georgian Initiative for Liberal Education (AGILE), an NGO. Thanks to their collaboration, Ilia State University became the first higher education institution in Georgia to establish a liberal arts program. In France, Chavagnes Studium , a Liberal Arts Study Centre in partnership with the Institut Catholique d'études supérieures, and based in a former Catholic seminary, is launching a two-year intensive BA in the Liberal Arts, with a distinctively Catholic outlook. It has been suggested that the liberal arts degree may become part of mainstream education provision in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other European countries. In 1999, the European College of Liberal Arts (now Bard College Berlin) was founded in Berlin and in 2009 it introduced a four-year Bachelor of Arts program in Value Studies taught in English, leading to an interdisciplinary",

He has previously taught at Yale , Columbia , and Johns Hopkins University . He is best known for his cultural studies scholarship on celebrity, masculinity, and film, and is frequently sought after for interviews on popular culture, Hollywood cinema, and the American zeitgeist of the 1950s. Background Leo Braudy was born in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , United States. He is the son of Edward and Zelda (Smith) Braudy; he received his B.A. from Swarthmore College in 1963 and his M.A. 1963 and Ph.D. 1967 from Yale University . He is married to the painter Dorothy Braudy . They live and work in Los Angeles . Scholarship Leo Braudy's books cover topics spanning literature, film, and other art forms, often with an eye toward understanding the impact of history on artistic form and the cultural expression of feelings. His books have been nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award and have been included among the Los Angeles Times' \"Best of the Best Books of the Year\" and the New York Times ' s \"Outstanding Books of the Year\". He is best known for The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and its History (Oxford, 1986); and From Chivalry to Terrorism: War and the Changing Nature of Masculinity (Knopf, 2003). His most recent book is Haunted: On ghosts, witches, vampires, zombies and other monsters of the natural and supernatural worlds (Yale University Press, 2016). Each of these works address changing cultural and historical definitions of what otherwise seem to be innate and unchanging emotions and attitudes—the desire for fame, the concept of masculinity, the shape of fear. Along with Marshall Cohen, Braudy also co-edits the widely used anthology Film Theory and Criticism (Oxford, 8th ed. 2016). His 2006 book On the Waterfront (British Film Institute) is a study of the namesake film 's production, the post-war values it reflects, and the controversy surrounding director Elia Kazan 's testimony before the House Unamerican Activities Committee . In 2011, The Hollywood Sign appeared in Yale University Press's American Icons series. It traces the intertwined history of Hollywood and its landmark sign from the founding of the city as a prohibitionist enclave in the 1880s through the beginnings of the movies, the construction of the sign in the 1920s as a real estate advertisement, and the mixed fortunes of both the sign and the film business down to the present. In a departure from his scholarly work, Braudy published in 2013 a memoir of his life as a teenager entitled Trying",

In addition to the university's central and departmental libraries, Oxford's colleges maintain their own libraries. The original college library, the Old Library, is located in the Cloister and accessed via Founder's Tower or the President's Lodgings. It contains a large collection of manuscripts from before the 19th century. Consultation of material is typically by appointment, although the Old Library itself may be visited by the public during certain exhibitions. In 1931, the New Library, now called the Longwall Library, was established in the former Magdalen College School building in Longwall Quad and became the college's main library for students. It was opened by Edward VIII when he was a student at Magdalen. It was renovated between 2014 and 2016 by Wright & Wright Architects and reopened by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge . In addition, the college maintains the Denning Law Library in the Grove building, a reference library for Magdalen's law students, and the specialist Daubeny and McFarlane collections of 19th century scientific works and medieval history works respectively. Items from the Daubeny and McFarlane libraries may be brought to the Longwall Library for consultation on request.

During the winter and spring, it is the home of a herd of fallow deer . It is possible to view the meadow and the deer from the path between New Buildings and Grove Quad, and also from the archway in New Buildings. In the 16th Century, as recorded in a map from 1578, the Grove consisted of formal enclosed gardens, tree-lined avenues, an orchard, and a fish pond. By 1630, a bowling green had replaced the orchard. During the Civil War , between 1642 and 1645, the Grove became home to the workshops, forges, and foundries of Royal Ordinance. Following this, the landscaping began to transition from formal gardens to more natural parkland, and the water walks were landscaped. Deer began being cultivated in the",

It is one of the wealthiest Oxford colleges, as of 2022, and one of the strongest academically, setting the record for the highest Norrington Score in 2010 and topping the table twice since then. It is home to several of the university's distinguished chairs , including the Agnelli-Serena Professorship , the Sherardian Professorship , and the four Waynflete Professorships . The large, square Magdalen Tower is an Oxford landmark, and it is a tradition, dating to the days of Henry VII , that the college choir sings from the top of it at 6 a.m. on May Morning . The college stands next to the River Cherwell and the University of Oxford Botanic Garden . Within its grounds are a deer park and Addison's Walk . History Foundation Magdalen College was founded in 1458 by William of Waynflete , Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor of England and named after St Mary Magdalene . The college succeeded a university hall called Magdalen Hall, founded by Waynflete in 1448, and from which the college drew most of its earliest scholars. Magdalen Hall was suppressed when the college was founded. The name was revived for a second Magdalen Hall, established in the college's grounds around 1490, which in the 19th century was moved to Catte Street and became Hertford College . Waynflete also established a school, now Magdalen College School , a private school located nearby on the other side of the Cherwell. Waynflete was assisted by a large bequest from Sir John Fastolf , who wished to fund a religious college. Magdalen College took over the site of St John the Baptist Hospital, alongside the Cherwell , initially using the hospital's buildings until new construction was completed between 1470 and 1480. At incorporation in 1458, the college consisted of a president and six scholars. In 1487 when the Founder's Statutes were written, the foundation consisted of a President, 40 fellows, 30 demies , four chaplain priests, eight clerks, 16 choristers, and appointed to the Grammar School, a Master and an usher. The founder's statutes included provision for a choral foundation of men and boys (a tradition that has continued to the present day) and made reference to the pronunciation of the name of the college in English. The college's name is pronounced like the adjective maudlin because the late medieval English name of Mary Magdalene was Maudelen, derived from the Old French Madelaine.

These windows, dating from 1792, are a reconstruction by glass painter Francis Eginton of an earlier 17th-century window that was destroyed in a storm. It had been uninstalled during World War II to protect it from damage, and was only restored in the 1990s. Much of the glass had been thought lost, until it was rediscovered in the ventilation tunnels under the New Building. Magdalen Tower Magdalen College Tower. Construction of Magdalen's Great Tower began in 1492 by another mason, William Raynold. It might have been intended to replace an existing belfry remaining from the hospital, and probably was originally envisioned to stand alone. By the time it was completed in 1509, additional buildings had been built either side, creating the roughly triangular Chaplain's quad between the chapel and the High. The tower contains a peal of ten bells hung for English change ringing . They were cast at a number of different foundries and the heaviest, weighing 17 cwt , was cast in 1623. The tower is 144 feet tall and an imposing landmark on the eastern approaches to the city centre. It has been the model for other towers, including Mitchell Tower of the University of Chicago , Manhattan 's First Presbyterian Church , and All Saints' Church in Churchill, Oxfordshire . It forms the centre of the May Morning celebrations in Oxford, from which the choir sing pieces including the Hymnus Eucharisticus and the Dean of Divinity blesses the University, city, and crowds. The New Building The New Building. During the 18th and 19th centuries, there were numerous attempts made to redesign the site to better suit the college's needs. The New Building began construction in 1733 as a part of Edward Holdsworth 's designs from 1731. It is built in a Palladian style , and features a colonnade . It was conceived as one side of a new \"Great Quadrangle\", and in anticipation of this the building's ends had been left unfinished. However, Holdsworth's full vision was never completed. The idea was revisited several times by later architects, including by architects James Wyatt —whose plans (never realised) included partially demolishing the existing,",

After Parliament’s victory, nearly the entire fellowship was expelled for refusing submission, and the college later endured James II’s 1687 attempt to impose a Catholic president. Beyond these political crises, Magdalen evolved scientifically with the 1848 Daubeny Laboratory and architecturally with 19th- and 20th-century quadrangles and annexes.
