      "text": "The J. Geils Band / ˈ ɡ aɪ l z / (formerly known as The J. Geils Blues Band ) was an American rock band formed in 1967, in Worcester, Massachusetts , under the leadership of guitarist John \"J.\" Geils . The original band members included vocalist Peter Wolf , harmonica, trumpet, and saxophone player Richard \"Magic Dick\" Salwitz , drummer Stephen Bladd, vocalist/keyboardist Seth Justman , and bassist Danny Klein . Wolf and Justman served as principal songwriters. The band played R&B -influenced blues rock during the 1970s, and achieved commercial success before moving toward a more mainstream new wave sound in the early 1980s, which brought the band to its commercial peak. They performed a mix of cover songs of classic blues and R&B songs, along with original compositions written primarily by Wolf and Justman, as well as some group compositions written under the pseudonymous name Juke Joint Jimmy . After Wolf left the band in 1983 to pursue a solo career, the band released one more album in 1984 with Justman and Bladd on lead vocals, before breaking up in 1985. Beginning in 1999, the band had several reunions until the death of its namesake, J. Geils, on April 11, 2017. The band first released several Top 40 singles in the early 1970s, including a cover of the song \" Lookin' For A Love \" by The Valentinos (which reached No. 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1972), as well as the single \" Give It to Me \" (No. 30 in 1973). Their biggest hits included \" Must of Got Lost \" (No. 12 in 1975), \"Come Back\" (No. 32 in 1980), \" Love Stinks \" (which reached No. 38 in 1980 and was featured in several films), \" Centerfold \" (No. 1 in 1982), and \" Freeze-Frame \" (No. 4 in 1982). Early days The band started in the mid-1960s while John Geils was attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute for a couple of semesters after transferring from Northeastern University in Boston (where he lived in \"The Playboy Room\" of the Gamma Phi Kappa fraternity). Originally named Snoopy and the Sopwith Camels , the group was an acoustic blues trio with Geils on guitar, bassist Danny Klein (\"Dr. Funk\"), and harmonica player Richard Salwitz (\" Magic Dick \"). In 1968, the band switched focus, going electric and recruiting two fellow musicians from Boston band The Hallucinations, drummer Stephen Jo Bladd and vocalist Peter Blankfield, a fast-talking former WBCN disc jockey with the air name Peter Wolf .",

And this was some pretty strong in-your-face music. People loved it.\" Davis said the Fillmore West shows were an \"eye-opening experience\" for him. While he became friendly with Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia , who was a fan of Davis' music, there were several thousands of mostly young, white hippies who were generally unfamiliar with him. Davis recalled: The place was packed with these real spacey, high, white people, and where we first started playing, people were walking around and talking. But after a while they all got quiet and really into the music. I played a little something like [from] Sketches of Spain and then went into the Bitches Brew shit, and that really blew them out. After that concert, every time I would play out there in San Francisco, a lot of young white people showed up at the gigs. Composition and performance Dave Holland in 1976 The songs in the band's set list were: \"Directions\", \"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down\", \"Willie Nelson\", \"I Fall in Love Too Easily\", \"Sanctuary\", \"It's About That Time\", \"Bitches Brew\", \"Masqualero\", \"Spanish Key\", and \"The Theme\". They were performed as one continuous and uninterrupted piece of music, a practice Davis had begun in 1967. He later explained in his autobiography that performing these kinds of long musical suites without breaks allowed more space for improvisations in concert. Most of the band's improvisations on Black Beauty centered around vamps or themes Davis introduced and restated during the performance. According to Davis scholar Paul Tingen , the record is filled with \"coded phrases \" he played on his trumpet to signify a change from one composition to the next. \"The music would be continuous so Miles wouldn't have to speak and announce things to the audience\", DeJohnette recalled. \"He'd just speak with his horn and just cue the numbers by stating the front part of the melody, and then we automatically knew, which was great, because he wanted it to be a seamless kind of thing.\" Holland, who played both acoustic and electric bass at the show, elaborated on the tradition of using such musical signals in jazz and their use in Davis' group: Back in the days with Louis Armstrong and King Oliver , the band would play exactly the same improvised phrase together, in unison. Nobody knew how they could do it. It was like magic. What happened was that King Oliver would play the phrase during the bars before. Louis would hear it and so when it came around the next time he would play it. I learned from Miles how these kind of cues can be used to change",

The Yardbirds performing c. early 1966 The single \" Shapes of Things \", released in February 1966, \"can justifiably be classified as the first psychedelic rock classic\", according to music journalist Richie Unterberger and heralded the coming of British psychedelia three months before the Beatles' \" Paperback Writer \"/\" Rain \". Reaching number three on the UK charts and 11 in the US, \"Shapes\" was also the Yardbirds' first self-penned hit, the previous three UK A-sides having been written by Gouldman. Relf's vague anti-war protest lyrics and Beck's feedback-driven, Middle Eastern-influenced solo reflected the band's increasing embrace of psychedelia, as did the UK B-side \"You're a Better Man Than I\" and the follow-up single, \" Over Under Sideways Down \". The latter was released in May and features more quixotic lyrics by Relf and another Eastern-inspired guitar line by Beck. The \"Over Under Sideways Down\" sessions were held in April 1966 and produced the album Yardbirds . It was commonly referred to as \" Roger the Engineer \", which were the words scrawled under a cartoon by Dreja of engineer Roger Cameron that appears on the cover of the UK release. In the US, an abridged version of the album, minus the cartoon cover art, was released as Over Under Sideways Down . The recording session marked the Yardbirds' split with their manager, Giorgio Gomelsky , as writer Simon Napier-Bell took over management and shared production credit with Samwell-Smith. The band, led by Relf and McCarty, eschewed cover material, writing the entire album themselves. They were allotted \"a whole week\" to record the album, according to Dreja, resulting in a \"crammed\" albeit an eclectic mix of blues, hard rock, monkish chanting (\"Turn into Earth\", \"Ever Since the World Began\") and African tribal rhythms (\"Hot House of Omagararshid\").

The band started the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists: Eric Clapton (1963–1965), Jeff Beck (1965–1966) and Jimmy Page (1966–1968), all of whom ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone magazine's 2011 list of 100 greatest guitarists. The band's other members during 1963–1968 were vocalist/harmonica player Keith Relf , drummer Jim McCarty , rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja , and bassist Paul Samwell-Smith , with Dreja switching to bass when Samwell-Smith departed in 1966. The band had a string of hits in the mid-1960s, including \" For Your Love \", \" Heart Full of Soul \", \" Shapes of Things \" and \" Over Under Sideways Down \". Originally a blues -based band noted for their signature \"rave-up\" instrumental breaks, the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop , pioneered psychedelic rock and early hard rock , and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s. Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock , progressive rock and heavy metal trends. Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance , and Page formed Led Zeppelin . The Yardbirds re-formed in the 1990s, featuring McCarty and Dreja as the only original members. Dreja left the band in 2012, leaving McCarty as the sole original member of the band. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. They were included at number 89 in Rolling Stone 's list of the \" 100 Greatest Artists of All Time \" and ranked number 37 on VH1 's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock .

Following a couple of gigs in September 1963 as the Blue-Sounds, they changed their name to the Yardbirds.

      "text": "David Jack Peverett (16 April 1943 – 7 February 2000), also known as Lonesome Dave , was an English singer and guitarist, best known as the original lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the rock band Foghat , which he co-founded following his tenure in Savoy Brown . Early years Peverett was an avid fan of the blues and of blues-based rock and roll , and mastered these forms while performing. In the formative pre- Beatles early 1960s, he was the vocalist and lead guitarist of the Nocturnes, which included his brother John Peverett (later to be Rod Stewart 's road manager before becoming a Baptist pastor in the United States) on drums, Keith Sutton on rhythm guitar, and Brixton neighbour Al \"Boots\" Collins (later to be editor of tourist magazines in the West Indies and Middle East) on tenor sax. The Nocturnes achieved London popularity as a pub and club band and provided backing for other performers at a recording studio in Soho. After a brief tour with Swiss blues band Les Questions (during which time he was billed as Lonesome Dave Jaxx), Dave joined Savoy Brown as a rhythm guitarist , eventually taking over as lead singer. After five albums with Savoy Brown he decided to pursue his own path along with drummer Roger Earl and took bassist Tony Stevens with them. The beginning of Foghat The new project took form with the addition of lead guitarist Rod Price in 1971. Peverett decided to call the new band Foghat (thought by some, mistakenly, to be a pun on the F word); this was actually a nonsense word he had made up as a child while playing Scrabble with his brother John. He used his new word to create Junior Foghat, an imaginary childhood playmate who became an alter ego and therefore the genesis of the \"Lonesome Dave\" persona that he was to employ as a performer. Foghat soon recorded their first, self-titled album for Bearsville Records , with Todd Rundgren and Dave Edmunds each producing tracks. With the success of an early single , a cover version of Willie Dixon 's \" I Just Want to Make Love to You \", their debut release soon went gold . Foghat success This would be the first of many gold and platinum albums for Peverett. In 1974, Foghat released two gold albums, Energized and Rock and Roll Outlaws . Their first platinum album, Fool for the City , was released in 1975, producing two hit singles : the title track, and \" Slow Ride \". Fool for the City featured Nick Jameson on bass, temporarily replacing Foghat bassist Tony Stevens. Jameson also toured with Foghat in support of the album.

Lennon was murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001; McCartney and Starr remain musically active. The Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time , with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide.

History 1956–1963: Formation The Quarrymen and name changes In November 1956, sixteen-year-old John Lennon formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool . They were called the Quarrymen , a reference to their school song \"Quarry men old before our birth\". Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney met Lennon on 6 July 1957 and joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison , then aged fifteen, to watch the band. Harrison auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young. After a month's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), Harrison performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \" Raunchy \" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as lead guitarist . By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art . The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. They also performed as the Rainbows . Paul McCartney later told New Musical Express that they called themselves that \"because we all had different coloured shirts and we couldn't afford any others!\" Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe , who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960. He suggested changing the band's name to Beatals , as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets .",

      "text": "Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West is a live double album by the American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis . It was recorded on April 10, 1970, at the Fillmore West in San Francisco , shortly after the release of the trumpeter's Bitches Brew album and the recording of Jack Johnson (1971). Black Beauty was produced by Teo Macero , Davis' longtime record producer. A jazz-rock and fusion album, Black Beauty captured one of Davis' first performances at a rock venue during the early stages of his electric period . At the concert, he led his band—saxophonist Steve Grossman , bassist Dave Holland , keyboardist Chick Corea , drummer Jack DeJohnette , and percussionist Airto Moreira —through one continuously performed set list which functioned as a musical suite for soloists to improvise throughout. He signaled changes from one piece to the next with phrases played on his trumpet. Black Beauty was first released only in Japan by CBS/Sony in 1973 without individual songs specified in the track listing. Columbia Records , Davis' American record label, had difficulty identifying the compositions for royalty purposes, and the album was not released in the United States until 1997. Critics were generally positive toward Black Beauty , although some were critical of its sound quality and Grossman's solos; Corea said the recording was an accurate document how that particular band of Davis' played live. Background Black Beauty was recorded in concert at the Fillmore West in San Francisco on April 10, 1970, when Davis performed as the opening act for the Grateful Dead . The performance took place soon after his studio album Bitches Brew had been released to stores, and he played some songs from the album. Davis led an ensemble that featured soprano saxophonist Steve Grossman , bassist Dave Holland , keyboardist Chick Corea , drummer Jack DeJohnette , and percussionist Airto Moreira . After the departure of saxophonist Wayne Shorter from the group earlier that year, Grossman was enlisted by Davis to participate in an April 7 recording session for his next album Jack Johnson (1971) before joining the live band. The April 10 show was the second of four concerts Davis played at the Fillmore West that month and one of his first concerts in a rock venue, having performed at New York City's Fillmore East a month earlier. His change to rock venues, suggested by Columbia Records president Clive Davis , helped the label market Bitches Brew to the counterculture audience. According to Holland, the trumpeter's music around this time became well received by the rock audiences they encountered. \"I heard quite recently from one of the [Grateful Dead's] ex-members that they were very nervous that they had to play up next to Miles\", Holland said. \"It was a time when people were not that worried about musical categories.

Critics later hailed it as the greatest electric jazz-funk record ever, praising the septet’s cathartic improvisations and guitarist Pete Cosey’s groundbreaking sounds.

Though initially divisive, the album profoundly influenced British jazz, new-wave, punk, and experimental rock guitarists, and its legend persists through venues like Prague’s AghaRTA Jazz Centrum.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nAgharta, Miles Davis electric period, Tadanori Yokoo artwork, Hollow Earth myth, jazz-funk fusion",

That album delivered their biggest hits: “Centerfold” (six weeks at #1) and “Freeze Frame” (#4), powered by heavy MTV rotation and arena tours with U2 and the Rolling Stones.

After swapping DJs and relentless touring, the Calabasas quintet pivoted to a more melodic, radio-ready style on 1999’s *Make Yourself*, whose acoustic push for “Pardon Me” and eventual smash “Drive” propelled the album to double-platinum status. Follow-ups *Morning View* (2001) and *A Crow Left of the Murder…* (2004) debuted at No. 2, while *Light Grenades* (2006) gave the band its first U.S. No. 1. Continuing through lineup changes, greatest-hits sets, and EPs like *Trust Fall*, Incubus has sold 23 million records worldwide, earning Grammy, AMA and Billboard nominations.  \n\n**Keywords**: Incubus, Make Yourself, alternative rock, nu-metal, mainstream breakthrough",

After early club years in Liverpool and Hamburg, the Lennon–McCartney–Harrison–Starr lineup achieved unprecedented global fame via Beatlemania, the British Invasion, and landmark albums from *Please Please Me* to *Abbey Road*. Their studio innovations, fashion influence, and sociocultural activism redefined the album format and youth identity. Post-breakup, all four members pursued solo careers; Lennon and Harrison have since died, while McCartney and Starr remain active. The band holds all-time sales records and major honors including 20 U.S. #1 singles, 15 UK #1 albums, eight Grammys, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  \n\n**Keywords**:  \nBeatlemania, British Invasion, album-era pioneers, cultural icons, record-breaking sales",

Formed around Clapton’s desire to escape celebrity and pursue Pattie Boyd, the band recorded with George Harrison and Duane Allman, scored a belated 1972 hit with “Layla,” and dissolved amid drug issues, critical indifference, and personal tragedy.

Core songwriter Paul Westerberg pushed stylistic boundaries—ballads, acoustic tracks, power-pop—often clashing with guitarist Bob Stinson’s preference for loud, fast punk. After breakthrough albums *Let It Be* (1984) and *Tim* (1985), internal friction, substance abuse, and lineup changes (Slim Dunlap replaced Stinson; Steve Foley later replaced drummer Chris Mars) shaped the quieter *Don’t Tell a Soul* (1989) and the critically praised *All Shook Down* (1990). The group disbanded after a raucous farewell show on July 4, 1991. Members pursued solo projects—Westerberg as a singer-songwriter, Tommy Stinson with Guns N’ Roses—until a 2012-2015 reunion featuring Westerberg, Stinson, and Mars plus Josh Freese, capped by festival dates and TV appearances.  \n\n**Keywords**:  \n- Replacements  \n- Paul Westerberg  \n- Hootenanny  \n- Let It Be  \n- Reunion",
