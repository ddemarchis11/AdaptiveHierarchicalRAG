      "text": "The 1878 Pornokratès by Belgian artist Félicien Rops The Decadent movement (from the French décadence , lit. ' decay ' ) was a late 19th-century artistic and literary movement, centered in Western Europe , that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality. The Decadent movement first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States. The movement was characterized by a belief in the superiority of human fantasy and aesthetic hedonism over logic and the natural world . Overview The concept of decadence dates to the 18th century, especially from the writings of Montesquieu , the Enlightenment philosopher who suggested that the decline ( décadence ) of the Roman Empire was in large part due to its moral decay and loss of cultural standards. When Latin scholar Désiré Nisard turned toward French literature, he compared Victor Hugo and Romanticism in general to the Roman decadence, men sacrificing their craft and their cultural values for the sake of pleasure. The trends that he identified, such as an interest in description, a lack of adherence to the conventional rules of literature and art, and a love for extravagant language, were the seeds of the Decadent movement. French Decadent movement The first major development in French decadence appeared when writers Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire used the word proudly to represent a rejection of what they considered banal \"progress\". Baudelaire referred to himself as decadent in his 1857 edition of Les Fleurs du mal and exalted the Roman decline as a model for modern poets to express their passion. He later used the term decadence to include the subversion of traditional categories in pursuit of full, sensual expression. In his lengthy introduction to Baudelaire in the front of the 1868 Les Fleurs du mal , Gautier at first rejects the application of the term decadent, as meant by the critic, but then works his way to an admission of decadence on Baudelaire's own terms: a preference for what is beautiful and what is exotic, an ease with surrendering to fantasy, and a maturity of skill with manipulating language. The Belgian Félicien Rops was instrumental in the development of this early stage of the Decadent movement. A friend of Baudelaire, he was a frequent illustrator of Baudelaire's writing, at the request of the author himself. Rops delighted in breaking artistic convention and shocking the public with gruesome, fantastical horror. He was explicitly interested in the Satanic, and he frequently sought to portray the double-threat of Satan and Woman. At times, his only goal was the portrayal of a woman he'd observed debasing herself in the pursuit of her own pleasure. It has been suggested that, no matter how horrific and perverse his images could be, Rops' invocation of supernatural elements was sufficient to keep Baudelaire situated",

      "text": "telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art.\" Influence and legacy Collapse of the Decadent movement In France, the Decadent movement could not withstand the loss of its leading figures. Many of those associated with the Decadent movement became symbolists after initially associating freely with decadents. Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé were among those, though both had been associated with Baju's Le Décadent for a time. Others kept a foot in each camp. Albert Aurier wrote decadent pieces for Le Décadent and also wrote symbolist poetry and art criticism. Decadent writer Rachilde was staunchly opposed to a symbolist take over of Le Décadent even though her own one-act drama The Crystal Spider is almost certainly a symbolist work. Others, once strong voices for decadence, abandoned the movement altogether. Joris-Karl Huysmans grew to consider Against Nature as the starting point on his journey into Roman Catholic symbolist work and the acceptance of hope. Anatole Baju, once the self-appointed school-master of French decadence, came to think of the movement as naive and half-hearted, willing to tinker and play with social realities, but not to utterly destroy them. He left decadence for anarchy. The Decadent movement beyond France While the Decadent movement, per se, was mostly a French phenomenon, the impact was felt more broadly. Typically, the influence was felt as an interest in pleasure, an interest in experimental sexuality, and a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged with a somewhat transgressive spirit and an aesthetic that values material excess. Many were also influenced by the Decadent movement's aesthetic emphasis on art for its own sake. Bohemia Czech writers who were exposed to the work of the Decadent movement saw in it the promise of a life they could never know. These Bohemian decadent writers included Karel Hlaváček , Arnošt Procházka, Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic , and Louisa Zikova. One Czech writer, Arthur Breisky , embraced the full spirit of Le Décadent with its exultation in material excess and a life of refinement and pleasure. From the Decadent movement he learned the basic idea of a dandy , and his work is almost entirely focused on developing a philosophy in which the Dandy is the consummate human, surrounded by riches and elegance, theoretically above society, just as doomed to death and despair as they. Britain Aubrey Beardsley, The Peacock Skirt , illustration for Oscar Wilde 's Salome , 1892 Influenced through general exposure but also direct contact, the leading decadent figures in Britain associated with decadence were Irish writer Oscar Wilde , poet Algernon Charles Swinburne , and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley , as well as other artists and writers associated with The",

      "text": "Karel Jan Bossart (February 9, 1904 – August 3, 1975) was an innovative rocket designer and creator of the Atlas ICBM . His achievements rank alongside those of Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolev . But as most of his work was for the United States Air Force and was therefore classified, his achievements are not widely known. Biography Karel Bossart was born on February 9, 1904, in Antwerp , Belgium . He graduated in Mining Engineering at the Université libre de Bruxelles in 1924. After winning a scholarship to Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the Belgian American Educational Foundation to study aeronautical engineering, he remained in the United States, working for various aircraft companies. In 1945 he was chief of structures at Convair and proposed to the United States Air Force that a missile could be developed with a range of 8000 km. The Air Force was skeptical of Bossart's proposal, partly wishing to preserve the priority of strategic bombers, but granted him a limited contract to develop a prototype. Bossart's major innovation was the use of a monocoque design in which structural support was maintained by pressure within the inelastic fuel tanks. After a series of tests in 1947 the Air Force lost interest and Bossart was instructed to abandon the research, but by 1951 the escalation of the Cold War enabled Bossart to revive the project that became known as 'Atlas'. In 1955 the Central Intelligence Agency reported that Soviet Russia had made swift progress on its own intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) programme and Atlas became a crash project of the highest national importance. Bossart used this opportunity to advance work with high energy cryogenic fuels that resulted in the Centaur upper stage. Atlas was first launched in June 1957 but was never fully effective as an ICBM. However, used as a launch vehicle , the Atlas design has excelled and has formed the basis of the most successful and reliable expendable rockets in service. As a result, Bossart's achievements include Launch of first communications satellite; Launch of first United States orbital crewed missions; Launch of Mariner probes to Mars and Venus ; and Launch of Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 to Jupiter and Saturn . In 1955 Bossart became chief engineer of the Atlas project and in 1957 was promoted to Technical Director of Aeronautics at General Dynamics. On December 17, 1957, eleven years of Bossart's work climaxed in the first successful flight of the Atlas. A few days later, on December 22, 1957, he appeared on What's My Line? as a guest credited as \"Rocket Designer U.S.A.F. Atlas Missile\". The next year, the Air Force awarded him the Exceptional Civilian Award for his work in developing America's first ICBM. His co-workers called Bossart one of the finest technical men in",

Established by Linnaeus in 1753 with 14 species, only four original taxa remain in the genus while others were reassigned to genera such as Senecio and Euryops; 13 former Othonna species now reside in the segregate genus Crassothonna (2012). A modern taxonomic revision led by the Compton Herbarium and SANBI is underway, beginning with the 2019 treatment of the geophytic O. bulbosa group. The name Othonna references a linen cloth, alluding to the downy indumentum of early-known species, and several species are colloquially called “bobbejaankool” (baboon cabbages) in Afrikaans.\n\n**Keywords**: Othonna, Crassothonna, Cape Floristic Region, taxonomic revision, succulent perennials",

Over three decades he supplied librettos—often in partnership with F. Zell (Camillo Walzel)—for many of the era’s most successful three-act Viennese operettas, including Der Bettelstudent, Gasparone, Eine Nacht in Venedig, and Boccaccio, set to music by Strauss II, Millöcker, Suppé, and Zeller. Genée also composed the 1876 operetta Der Seekadett, whose second-act chess scene gave its name to the “Seekadettenmatt/Légal Trap” chess opening. Numerous German-language films from 1917-1979 adapted these works, keeping Genée’s stage legacy alive well into the 20th century.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nRichard Genée, Viennese operetta, Die Fledermaus, librettist, Seekadettenmatt",
