      "text": "Valeria Sarmiento (born 29 October 1948) is a film editor , director and screenwriter best known for her work in France, Portugal and her native Chile. She has worked both in film and television , directing 20 feature films, documentaries and television series '. She is the widow of Chilean film director Raúl Ruiz (1941-2011) with whom she collaborated for decades as regular editor and co-writer. She has also edited films for Luc Moullet , Robert Kramer and Ventura Pons and is a Guggenheim Fellow (1988) . Biography Sarmiento was born in the Chilean municipality of Valparaíso and was first exposed to film at the age of five, becoming familiar with the work of Orson Welles , Alfred Hitchcock and others. She rarely saw French films due to censorship but, thanks to what she refers to as a \"moment of magic\", was able to watch Jean-Luc Godard 's Breathless (1960) at the age of twelve. She went on to study film and philosophy at the University of Valparaíso and married filmmaker Raúl Ruiz in 1969. In 1974, the couple were forced to move to Paris due to the 1973 Chilean coup d'état of Augusto Pinochet . Sarmiento made her directorial debut with the documentary Un sueño como de colores (1972) about a group of Chilean women dedicated to striptease . Her later work as a director, usually in melodrama , romantic drama and costume drama , has also often featured strong female characters who face machismo and sexism . Her debut feature Notre mariage (1984) was a Grand Prix winner for Best New Director at the San Sebastián International Film Festival , her 1991 film Amelia Lópes O'Neill was entered into the 41st Berlin International Film Festival and her Napoleonic war epic Lines of Wellington competed for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival . A symposium on Sarmiento's feminism was held at Stanford University in May 2008, the Cinémathèque Française ran a Sarmiento retrospective in October 2018, and a Ruiz/Sarmiento retrospective will take place at the Filmoteca de Catalunya in October 2025.

She has also been the casting director for several other films, including Monsoon Wedding (2001) and Brick Lane (2007). She has been a casting consultant for The Namesake (2007). Loveleen has featured in the \"Annual Women's Big Impact Report\", an initiative of Hollywood's Variety magazine, which profiles women that have made pathbreaking contributions in world entertainment. Early life and background Loveleen Tandan was born and raised in New Delhi, India. She did her schooling from Mater Dei School. Loveleen studied Sociology Honors at the Hindu College, University of Delhi . She was active in college politics and was nominated as the Finance Minister of the college. She pursued a Master's degree with top honors in Mass Communication from MCRC , Jamia Millia Islamia University. Career Loveleen Tandan has worked with Deepa Mehta on Earth (1998), and later worked with Mira Nair on three films: Monsoon Wedding (2001), Vanity Fair (2004) and The Namesake (2006). She was also the casting director (alongside Shaheen Baig) for Brick Lane (2007), directed by Sarah Gavron and adapted from Monica Ali 's novel of the same name. Tandan's most major credit is Slumdog Millionaire (2008), where she initially began as one of the film's casting directors (with Gail Stevens co-ordinating casting from London) but was, during production on the film, designated as the \"Co-Director: India\" by Danny Boyle in recognition of her significant contributions in the making of the film. Boyle explained his reasoning behind the credit by stating it was \"because I had her there every day, and I kind of relied on her enormously to make sure I didn't make any big mistakes, and obviously, translation for the kids. And translation of the text because obviously, if you translate a line of Simon's literally into Hindi, a seven-year-old is just going to go… So, they had to be given a line that was the equivalent in Hindi.\" Tandan herself has stated that she was given the co-director credit after she \"suggested to Danny and Simon Beaufoy, the writer of Slumdog, that it was important to do some of it in Hindi to bring the film alive (20% of the film is in Hindi). They asked me to come up with Hindi dialogues which I, of course, instantly agreed to do. And as we drew closer to the shoot date, Danny asked me to step in as the co-director.\" The film won eight Academy Awards, five Critics' Choice Awards , four Golden Globes and seven BAFTA Awards . Tandan's work as co-director of the film was recognised by the New York Film Critics Online Awards",

It lies in the Taconic Mountains , near the state's far western edge, and northwest of nearby Pittsfield . The summit of Jiminy Peak, which includes the Hendricks Summit Lodge, is located in Lanesborough . The mountain is owned by Sculptor Capital Management but the operating company is owned and managed by Brian Fairbank, the longtime former owner of the Resort. During the winter Jiminy Peak offers skiing , snowboarding , outdoor pools, and various restaurants. There are 45 trails and nine lifts, including a six-person, high speed chairlift . In the summer additional activities are offered at Mountain Adventure Park , such as an alpine super slide , mountain coaster , hiking , and mountain biking . The Aerial Adventure Park is a challenge course up in the trees. Five levels provide both physical and mental challenges for all levels. Courses range from 15–50 feet (5–15 m) in the air. Jiminy Peak has installed the second mountain coaster in the country (the first on the East Coast) and is the home of the nation's first Alpine Super Slide (June 1977). In August 2007, Jiminy became the first private U.S. business to invest in its own megawatt class wind turbine . The turbine generates approximately 35% of the annual energy used at the resort. The winds blow strongest in the winters, which is when the resort uses the most energy, for lifts and snowmaking. This is the largest commitment in Jiminy Peak's ongoing environmental sustainability efforts. In February 2012, the Resort installed a CoGeneration Unit in the Country Inn to provide both heat and hot water to the hotel. In the past decade, the mountain has been increasingly developed for real estate , as the demand for housing and activities has also increased. The mountain has 15,000 square feet (1,400 m 2 ) of meeting space for meetings , conferences, weddings , parties, and other events. Lift System Jiminy Peak has 7 chairlifts , and 2 Magic Carpets .

The Fairbank group took corrective measured and was ordered to pay a $21,582 penalty.

He was a director of silent films during the 1920s, and in the 1930s he became associated with the style of poetic realism in French cinema . He adopted French nationality in 1928. Career Born Jacques Léon Louis Frédérix in Ixelles , Belgium, he was educated at the École régimentaire in Nivelles, and was destined for a military career. At age twenty-five however he moved to Paris where he pursued an interest in acting, first on stage and then in film, adopting the name Jacques Feyder . He joined the Gaumont Film Company and in 1914 he became an assistant director with Gaston Ravel . He started directing films for Gaumont in 1916, but his career was interrupted by service with the Belgian Army from 1917 to 1919 during World War I . Henry Roussel and Albert Préjean (right) in Les Nouveaux Messieurs (1929) After the end of the war, he returned to filmmaking and quickly built a reputation as one of the most innovative directors in French cinema. L'Atlantide (1921) (based on the novel by Pierre Benoit ), and Crainquebille (1922) (from the novel by Anatole France ) were his first major films to achieve public and critical attention. He followed these with Visages d'enfants (filmed in 1923 but not released until 1925) which proved to be one of his most personal and enduring films. Shortly after this, Feyder was offered a post as artistic director of a new film company, Vita Films, in Vienna, along with a contract to make three films. He made Das Bildnis ( L'Image ) (1923), but the company failed and he returned to Paris. He re-established himself with Gribiche (1926) and the literary adaptations of Carmen (1926) and Thérèse Raquin (1928). He also contributed screenplays of films for other directors, notably Poil de carotte (1925) for Julien Duvivier , and Gardiens de phare (1929) for Jean Grémillon . His last silent film in France was Les Nouveaux Messieurs , a topical political satire which provoked calls for it to be banned in France for \"insulting the dignity of parliament and its ministers\". By this time Feyder had accepted an offer from MGM to work in Hollywood, where in 1929 his first project was directing Greta Garbo in The Kiss , her last silent film. It was in Hollywood that he made the transition to sound films;",

Career Along with collaborating with future Blair Witch cohorts Eduardo Sánchez and Gregg Hale on a trilogy of short films, Myrick supported himself by working as an editor and cinematographer on a number of Florida-based music videos and commercials. After he wrote and directed the promo for the Florida Film Festival in 1997, Myrick's work caught the eye of independent film guru John Pierson , helping to set the stage for the eventual 1999 debut of Myrick and Sanchez's first feature as co-writers and directors. In 2006, he co-founded Raw Feed , a direct to DVD division of Warner Home Video that specialized in horror films, with The X-Files executive producer John Shiban and 24 executive producer Tony Krantz . In 2025, Myrick endorsed a bill in the Maryland General Assembly to exonerate people convicted of witchcraft in Colonial Maryland , stating that \"We are a flawed nation, and were born out of doing some incredibly cruel things” and that a belated \"symbolic\" recognition of past injustice was better than none at all.

He directed plays and designed sets and lighting after school, was a non-union projectionist at Varsity Theatre, and worked as a production assistant at the KOBI news station in Medford . He supported himself by working as a busboy, dishwasher, and fry cook. Career 1983–1991: Early work While establishing himself in the film industry, Fincher was employed at John Korty 's studio as a production head. Gaining further experience, he became a visual effects producer, working on the animated Twice Upon a Time (1983) with George Lucas. He was hired by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) in 1983 as an assistant cameraman and matte photographer and worked on Return of the Jedi (1983) and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). In 1984, he left ILM to direct a television commercial for the American Cancer Society that depicted a fetus smoking a cigarette. This quickly brought Fincher to the attention of producers in Los Angeles, and he was soon given the opportunity to direct Rick Springfield 's 1985 documentary, To The Beat of the Live Drum . Set on a directing career, Fincher co-founded production company Propaganda Films and started directing commercials and music videos.

His films explored recurring themes such as unattainable love, the tension between perception and reality, and maternal devotion, often realized through meticulous visual composition and strong collaborations with actors and designers like Lazare Meerson. After early success in France, Feyder worked in Hollywood, Germany, and Britain, adapting to sound cinema and directing multilingual versions of films. His mid-1930s French works, especially *Le Grand Jeu*, *Pension Mimosas*, and *La Kermesse héroïque*, helped define poetic realism and influenced future filmmakers like Marcel Carné. Despite critical neglect post-WWII, Feyder’s craftsmanship and international scope mark him as a key transitional figure in European film history.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nJacques Feyder, poetic realism, French cinema, silent to sound transition, La Kermesse héroïque",
