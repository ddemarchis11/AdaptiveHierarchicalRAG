There may be no such thing as the sweet life. But it is necessary to find that out for yourself. Preferences Favorites In an essay looking back at his first 25 years as a film critic, Ebert wrote: If I had to make a generalization, I would say that many of my favorite movies are about Good People ... Casablanca is about people who do the right thing. The Third Man is about people who do the right thing and can never speak to one another as a result ... Not all good movies are about Good People. I also like movies about bad people who have a sense of humor. Orson Welles , who does not play either of the good people in The Third Man , has such a winning way, such witty dialogue, that for a scene or two we almost forgive him his crimes. Henry Hill, the hero of Goodfellas , is not a good fella, but he has the ability to be honest with us about why he enjoyed being bad. He is not a hypocrite. Of the other movies I love, some are simply about the joy of physical movement. When Gene Kelly splashes through Singin' in the Rain , when Judy Garland follows the yellow brick road, when Fred Astaire dances on the ceiling, when John Wayne puts the reins in his teeth and gallops across the mountain meadow, there is a purity and joy that cannot be resisted. In Equinox Flower , a Japanese film by the old master Yasujirō Ozu , there is this sequence of shots: A room with a red teapot in the foreground. Another view of the room. The mother folding clothes. A shot down a corridor with a mother crossing it at an angle, and then a daughter crossing at the back. A reverse shot in the hallway as the arriving father is greeted by the mother and daughter. A shot as the father leaves the frame, then the mother, then the daughter. A shot as the mother and father enter the room, as in the background the daughter picks up the red pot and leaves the frame. This sequence of timed movement and cutting is as perfect as any music ever written, any dance, any poem. Ebert credits film historian Donald Richie and the Hawaii International Film Festival for introducing him to Asian cinema through Richie's invitation to join him on the jury of the festival in 1983, which quickly became a favorite of his and would frequently attend along with Richie, lending their support to validate the festival's status as a \"festival of record\".

He lamented the decline of campus film societies: \"There was once a time when young people made it their business to catch up on the best works by the best directors, but the death of film societies and repertory theaters put an end to that, and for today's younger filmgoers, these are not well-known names: Buñuel , Fellini , Bergman , Ford , Kurosawa , Ray , Renoir , Lean , Bresson , Wilder , Welles . Most people still know who Hitchcock was, I guess.\" Ebert argued for the aesthetic values of black-and-white photography and against colorization, writing: Black-and-white movies present the deliberate absence of color. This makes them less realistic than color films (for the real world is in color). They are more dreamlike, more pure, composed of shapes and forms and movements and light and shadow. Color films can simply be illuminated. Black-and-white films have to be lighted ... Black and white is a legitimate and beautiful artistic choice in motion pictures, creating feelings and effects that cannot be obtained any other way. He wrote: \"Black-and-white (or, more accurately, silver-and-white) creates a mysterious dream state, a simpler world of form and gesture. Most people do not agree with me. They like color and think a black-and-white film is missing something. Try this. If you have wedding photographs of your parents and grandparents, chances are your parents are in color and your grandparents are in black and white. Put the two photographs side by side and consider them honestly. Your grandparents look timeless. Your parents look goofy. The next time you buy film for your camera, buy a roll of black-and-white. Go outside at dusk, when the daylight is diffused. Stand on the side of the house away from the sunset. Shoot some natural-light closeups of a friend. Have the pictures printed big, at least 5 x 7. Ask yourself if this friend, who has always looked ordinary in every color photograph you've ever taken, does not suddenly, in black and white, somehow take on an aura of mystery. The same thing happens in the movies.\" Ebert championed animation, particularly the films of Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata . In his review of Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke , he wrote: \"I go to the movies for many reasons. Here is one of them. I want to see wondrous sights not available in the real world, in stories where myth and dreams are set free to play. Animation opens that possibility, because it is freed from gravity and the chains of the possible. Realistic films show the physical world; animation shows its essence. Animated films are not copies of 'real movies,' are not shadows of reality, but create a new existence in their own right.\" He concluded his review of Ratatouille by writing: \"Every",

After he wrote and directed the promo for the Florida Film Festival in 1997, Myrick's work caught the eye of independent film guru John Pierson , helping to set the stage for the eventual 1999 debut of Myrick and Sanchez's first feature as co-writers and directors. In 2006, he co-founded Raw Feed , a direct to DVD division of Warner Home Video that specialized in horror films, with The X-Files executive producer John Shiban and 24 executive producer Tony Krantz . In 2025, Myrick endorsed a bill in the Maryland General Assembly to exonerate people convicted of witchcraft in Colonial Maryland , stating that \"We are a flawed nation, and were born out of doing some incredibly cruel things” and that a belated \"symbolic\" recognition of past injustice was better than none at all.

The comic had been stolen from him in 2000, and Cage had received an insurance payment on the item. In March 2011, it was found in a storage locker in the San Fernando Valley and was verified by ComicConnect.com to be the copy sold to Cage previously. Worth around $25 million by May 2017, Cage was reportedly \"taking [film] roles left and right\" in order to pay off his remaining debts. By 2022, Cage confirmed that he had finally paid off his debts and intended to be more selective with his film roles. Legal issues Kathleen Turner wrote in her 2008 memoir, Send Your Roses , that Cage had stolen a chihuahua and was arrested twice for driving drunk while they filmed Peggy Sue Got Married . Later she admitted Cage did not steal a chihuahua and she was sorry. Cage won a libel action against Turner, her publisher Headline Publishing Group , and Associated Newspapers (whose publication the Daily Mail had repeated the allegations when they published an excerpt from the book). Christina Fulton sued Cage in December 2009 for $13 million and for the house in which she was living. The suit was in response to an order that she leave the dwelling; the order resulted from Cage's financial difficulties. The case was settled in June 2011. Cage was arrested in New Orleans' French Quarter district on April 15, 2011, for suspicion of domestic abuse battery , disturbing the peace and public intoxication. A police officer was flagged down by onlookers after Cage allegedly grabbed his wife's upper arm while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol. Cage was held in police custody until a bail of $11,000 was posted by Duane \"Dog\" Chapman . He was later ordered to appear in court on May 31, 2011. The New Orleans District Attorney announced that the charges against Cage had been dropped on May 5, 2011.

Nicholson won his second Oscar, an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor , for his role of retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove in Terms of Endearment (1983), directed by James L. Brooks . It starred Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger . McGilligan claims it was one of Nicholson's most complex and unforgettable characters. He and MacLaine played many of their scenes in different ways, constantly testing and making adjustments. Their scenes together gave the film its \"buoyant edge\", states McGilligan, and describes Nicholson's acting as \"Jack floating like a butterfly\". Nicholson continued to work prolifically in the 1980s, starring in such films as: The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981); Reds (1981), where Nicholson portrays the writer Eugene O'Neill with a quiet intensity; Prizzi's Honor (1985); Heartburn (1986); The Witches of Eastwick (1987); Broadcast News (1987); and Ironweed (1987). Three Oscar nominations also followed ( Reds , Prizzi's Honor , and Ironweed ). John Huston , who directed Prizzi's Honor , said of Nicholson's acting, \"He just illuminates the book. He impressed me in one scene after another; the movie is composed largely of first takes with him.\" In the 1989 Batman movie, Nicholson played the psychotic villain, the Joker . The film was an international smash hit, and a lucrative deal earned him a percentage of the box office gross estimated at $60 million to $90 million.

Critic David Thomson notes that Nicholson's character \"blazed and roared\". The film's director, Rob Reiner , recalls how Nicholson's level of acting experience affected the other actors during rehearsals: \"I had the luck of having Jack Nicholson there. He knows what he's doing, and he comes to play, every time out, full-out performance!

It features former US Representative ( Independent ) Joe Scarborough reporting and discussing the news of the day in a panel format with co-hosts Mika Brzezinski (whom Scarborough married in November 2018), Willie Geist , who regularly co-hosts from Tuesdays to Fridays, and Jonathan Lemire , along with recurring and special guests. History Morning Joe began as a fill-in program after Don Imus ' Imus in the Morning was canceled in April 2007. Former Florida Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough, then host of the primetime MSNBC program Scarborough Country , suggested the idea of doing a morning show instead. He put together what would become Morning Joe with Scarborough Country executive producer Chris Licht and screenwriter John Ridley . The pun in the show's title is echoed by a coffee ring in its logo. On April 16, 2007 (Imus' show aired until April 11, 2007 on MSNBC), the show debuted as one of a series of rotating programs auditioning for Imus's former slot, with Scarborough joined by co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Ridley. Scarborough had personally asked Brzezinski to co-host with him the night before the first audition, while she was a \"cut-in\" presenter during MSNBC's primetime schedule on a freelance basis. Ridley quickly dropped out as main co-host but continued as a regular guest, while Willie Geist was tapped as co-host. The program permanently took over the slot in July 2007, though the decision was not officially announced until October that year. During the first quarter of 2009, Morning Joe earned higher ratings in the age 25-54 demo category than CNN 's competing program, American Morning , but had fewer viewers overall. Both programs finished behind Fox News 's Fox & Friends during the same time period. By March 2010, the show's ratings remained behind those of Fox & Friends , but surpassed its other cable competitors American Morning , Morning Express with Robin Meade , and Squawk Box . Morning Joe continued to regularly place second in total viewers and younger demographic to Fox & Friends , ahead of other cable news competitors including CNN 's New Day . However, Morning Joe ranked behind CNN's counterpart programming during short stints in 2013. Over the years, the program's focus has shifted partly toward enterprise journalism : Scarborough and Brzezinski provide exclusives from the United States Congress , the US State Department , and the White House .
