      "text": "Poleconomy is a board game invented by New Zealander Bruce E. Hatherley and first published in 1980. Players compete to acquire properties and investments by controlling economic and political activity . It mirrors real-world businesses and players compete to control government decisions and taxation which affect their businesses. The playing time is set by agreement from all players, e.g. 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the monetary sum of all player cash, companies, insurance or other assets. The game can also end when there are no more companies, advertisements in the bank or bonds in the treasury. Another objective of the game is \"to teach players some of the fundamentals of economics, and the ways in which the economy and the government interact.\" Different editions were published for several different countries. The name Poleconomy is a portmanteau of \"politics\" and \"economy\". History Poleconomy was invented by Bruce Hatherley, a New Zealander from Christchurch who was living in Sydney at the time. He first filed a US patent claim for it in January 1981. It was published in 1980, first in an Australian edition, then a New Zealand edition. The New Zealand edition was produced by Tanner Couch and Robyn Larsen sold the squares on the board as advertising space to the actual companies represented. The New Zealand Stock Exchange was involved with the launch in Auckland . It was also published by World Games. Hatherley contacted Canadian think tank the Fraser Institute to help introduce the game to Canada in 1983. Michael Walker, an employee of the Institute, sold the first squares as advertising and the rest were sold by stockbrokers , who had little other work because of a recession at the time. More than a million dollars was raised by the Institute and Poleconomy was credited with helping the Institute survive the recession. It was later sold in South Africa and the United Kingdom in other localised versions. More than 1.5 million copies of Poleconomy have been sold internationally, incorporating the participation of 260 major corporate sponsors who leased advertising space in the separate national versions. US patent 4,522,407 was granted for the game in 1985. The game Players compete to acquire properties and investments through stylized economic and political activity . This involves the purchase of real-world companies and advertising using artificial money. The players take turns moving around the board via the roll of the dice, landing on the gameboard squares and carrying out instruction according to the square's contents or player decision. The game is unusual in its mirroring of real-world businesses for which it has licenses to use their trademarks. It also illustrates how political events such as government decisions and taxation affect the economy. The players take turns at being the prime minister or president through elections. Once in power they have the ability to dictate the levels of inflation and so increasing or decreasing rents for property owners. If a player cannot cover their rent, the debt is written off and",

The player with the most cans win the game. Details The game revolves around a game board featuring plastic farm-related items sticking out of it. Each player selects a goat as their playing piece, placing the pieces along the goat pen on the board. Players move goat-shaped pieces around the board, attempting to complete tasks to win tin can pieces. The first player to move their goat onto the roof of the barn ends the game, and the winner is then the player with the most tin cans. Movement is determined by an included spinner, which makes the game run purely on luck. Game pieces Deck of cards Six Goat player figures A farmer piece A bell Box of cans References Sources Hey Pa!

Once in power they have the ability to dictate the levels of inflation and so increasing or decreasing rents for property owners. If a player cannot cover their rent, the debt is written off and they can continue, receiving a government salary; no-one becomes bankrupt. According to the rules the game ends when the central bank runs out of money. Enterprise Australia sponsored the game to \"improve understanding of the free enterprise system\" among schoolchildren, and sold over 100,000 copies. The introduction to the rules of the New Zealand version quotes Enterprise New Zealand, \"The game reflects the way industry, finance and government interact when private enterprise operates within a system of parliamentary democracy.\" Companies featured in the game Reception Paul Cockburn reviewed Poleconomy for Imagine magazine, and stated that \"Indeed, in a game where players are being cautious and keeping the amount of cash in front of them at a minimum (which limits the government's ability to tax) it's very hard not to bankrupt the country.\" In the March 1989 edition of Games International (Issue #3), John Harrington pointed out that \"what we have here is a direct descendant of Monopoly .\" He found the voting system in the basic game, which was simply based on rolls of dice, \"disappointing\", and recommended that players move to the advanced game as quickly as possible. Harrington concluded by giving the game an average rating of 3 out of 5, saying, \"I can give the advanced version of Poleconomy a recommendation, if only on the grounds that trying to stop the country going down the toilet is an illuminating experience.\" References External links Poleconomy Rules",

He attended St Edmund's College, Ware before studying at the University of Bristol where he received his BVSc degree and completed his PhD degree in animal behaviour from De Montfort University . Biography After some time spent in general practice, he became a Lecturer, Senior Lecturer and Principal Lecturer in animal behaviour at De Montfort University, and subsequently the University of Lincoln , where he has been Head of the Department of Biological Sciences, and now heads up the clinical animal behaviour team. He has an active teaching and research portfolio. His research has focused on the assessment of emotion in companion animals and the use of semiochemicals to manage their problem behaviour (pheromonatherapy ). He has led the development of what has become known as the psychobiological approach to animal behaviour assessment, and has published more than 200 full scientific papers, books and chapters. Among his achievements are becoming the first person within the UK to be recognised as a specialist in veterinary behavioural medicine by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons . and being awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in 2016 in recognition of his contribution to the field. In 2020 he was also listed in the top 2% of scientists in the world and in 2021 was in the top 1% of cited scientists. The psychobiological approach to animal behaviour assessment, which he has pioneered, provides a scientific framework for making inferences about motivational and emotional state in animals. His recognised practical achievements include the development of the Lincoln stable mirror to assist horses with isolation problems and validation of the use of animal pheromones to influence unwanted behaviour; he has also developed a series of freely available, validated, psychometric instruments for assessment of emotional predisposition in dogs. He has appeared on several scientific and popular television programmes, such as the Horizon (BBC TV series) programme: the Secret Life of the Dog and Bang Goes the Theory . Since 2020, he has run an occasional podcast series \"What makes you click?\", in which he chats with colleagues from the field of clinical animal behaviour and welfare.

We keep forgetting it. She didn't win there on her merit.\" The comments, widely reacted to as sexist and unfair, were criticized by such diverse media figures as Bill O'Reilly , Joy Behar , and Gloria Steinem . They also led to protests outside NBC's Washington, D.C. studios, as well as a joint letter of complaint to NBC from the National Organization for Women , Feminist Majority , and the National Women's Political Caucus . Matthews apologized for the comments on the January 17, 2008, edition of his program, Hardball with Chris Matthews . Institution of a seven-second delay On November 10, 2008, Scarborough read the word \" fuck \" on air while reading from a story about then-President-elect Obama's incoming Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel . Once he realized his mistake, Scarborough repeatedly apologized for his slip of the tongue, and explained that he had meant to say \"the F word\" instead. The next day, the network instituted a seven-second delay for Morning Joe . In another incident on June 29, 2011, then Time editor-at-large Mark Halperin commented that the president came off as \"kind of a dick \" during the previous day's press conference. The word aired uncensored, despite the seven-second delay, when a producer failed to press the button that would have \"bleeped\" it. Halperin issued an on-air apology immediately following a commercial break. The White House subsequently complained about Halperin's remarks, and on June 30, 2011, Halperin was temporarily suspended for \"slurring\" the president. He returned as a guest a couple of weeks later. \"Stunningly superficial\" On December 30, 2008, Brzezinski's father and former National Security Advisor to President Jimmy Carter , Zbigniew Brzezinski appeared as a guest to discuss the unfolding Israel–Palestine crisis. Scarborough stated that Yasser Arafat was offered everything he wanted at the 2000 Camp David Summit . This statement provoked Zbigniew to reply, \"You know, you have such a stunningly superficial knowledge of what went on that it's almost embarrassing to listen to you.\" Subsequently, the phrase \"stunningly superficial\" has become something of a running gag on the show.

U.S. House of Representatives Elections Scarborough in 1995 In 1994 , Scarborough was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for Florida's 1st congressional district , becoming the first Republican to represent the Florida Panhandle since Reconstruction . The seat had become open when eight-term Democratic incumbent Earl Hutto retired. In the general election, Scarborough defeated the Democratic candidate, Pensacola attorney Vince \"Vinnie\" Whibbs, Jr., with 61 percent of the vote. Whibbs was the son of former Pensacola mayor Vince Whibbs . This district had not supported a Democratic candidate for U.S. president since 1960 ; however, Democratic candidates had continued to hold most local offices well into the 1990s. Scarborough's win coincided with a large Republican wave, known as the Republican Revolution , that allowed the Republicans to take the majority in the House for the first time in 40 years. Scarborough was reelected with 72 percent of the vote in 1996. In 1998 and 2000, he faced only write-in candidates as opposition. Tenure In June 2000, during his congressional career, he received a 95 percent lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union . He signed the Contract with America . Scarborough was a member of the Armed Services , Judiciary , Government Reform , and Education committees. In 1998 he was named chairman of the Civil Service Committee. Scarborough was one of a group of about 40 freshmen Republican legislators who dubbed themselves the \"New Federalists\" after The Federalist Papers . Scarborough was elected political director of the incoming legislators. The New Federalists called for sweeping cuts in the U.S. government, including plans to \" privatize , localize, consolidate, [or] eliminate\" the Departments of Commerce , Education , Energy and Housing and Urban Development . House Speaker Newt Gingrich tapped Scarborough to head a Republican task force on education, and Scarborough declared, \"Our goal is to get as much money, power, and authority out of Washington and get as much money, power, and authority into the classroom as possible.\" Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), then chairman of the House Budget Committee , adopted Scarborough's language eliminating the federal Department of Education in the 1996 House Budget Resolution. The budget passed the House by a vote of 238–193. Scarborough and the group played a pivotal role in pressing Gingrich to keep the GOP's promise to balance the federal budget. Scarborough supported a number of anti-abortion positions while in Congress including banning family planning funding in US aid abroad; banning partial-birth abortions ; and making it illegal to transport minors to get an abortion.
