He has collaborated with artists such as Dillon and Glenn Fabry on Preacher , John McCrea on Hitman , Marc Silvestri on The Darkness , and Carlos Ezquerra on both Preacher and Hitman . His work has won him recognition in the comics industry, including nominations for the Comics Buyer's Guide Award for Favorite Writer in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. Like his inspiration, Alan Moore , he is a promoter of left-liberal ideas , for which he has received numerous awards and recognition from specialised British and American publications and organisations, such as the UK Comic Art Award and the Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Awards . Early life Ennis was born in Holywood , a suburb of Belfast , Northern Ireland. Raised with no religion , Ennis's first exposure to the idea of God was as a six-year-old in primary school. Ennis's teacher told the class that God was a being who could see inside their hearts, was always around them, and would ultimately reward or punish them. Ennis described the idea as bewildering, strange and terrifying. He later used this experience in his comic book series Preacher , whose protagonist is slapped after telling his grandmother that he finds the concept of God \"scary\". Although the fictional violence in that story was not reflected in Ennis's real-life upbringing, his classmates later reassured each other that they all loved God, though Ennis said, \"I think I hate him.\" Ennis later asked his mother about God, and when she asked him what he thought about the idea, Ennis responded, \"It sounds kind of stupid,\" a statement the adult Ennis clarified was meant to mask his fear. His mother's response was, \"Well, there you are, then.\" In 1980, Ennis won second place in the Young Ornithologist's Club 's Young Ornithologist of the Year competition in the 10-12 age bracket. In 1987, Ennis befriended artist John McCrea while shopping at the first comic book specialty shop in Belfast , which had been opened by McCrea and another friend. Ennis would later ask McCrea to illustrate his first professional comics project. It was here that Ennis first met comics writer Alan Moore , who advised him to focus on creator-owned work rather than letting comic companies take ownership of his intellectual property. Career UK work Ennis began his comic-writing career on his nineteenth birthday in 1989, with the series Troubled Souls in the British anthology Crisis .

The Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation is reservation located in southeastern Montana , that is approximately 690 square miles (1,800 km 2 ) large. It is home to approximately 6,000 Cheyenne people. The reservation is bounded on the east by the Tongue River and on the west by the Crow Reservation . There are small parcels of non-contiguous off-reservation trust lands in Meade County, South Dakota , northeast of the city of Sturgis . Its timbered ridges that extend into northwestern South Dakota are part of Custer National Forest and it is approximately 40 miles (64 km) east of the site of the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn . In March 2013, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe had 12,266 people enrolled citizens, of which about 6,012 resided on the reservation, [ incomplete short citation ] with approximately 91% of the population Native American (full or part blood quantum ) and 72.8% identifying as Cheyenne. Slightly more than a quarter of the population five years or older spoke a language other than English. Members of the Crow Tribe also live on the reservation. The tribal and government headquarters are located in Lame Deer , where they host the annual Northern Cheyenne powwow . Demographics Traditional Cheyenne spiritual culture, like most traditional Indigenous spiritual ways, values the peoples' connection to their landbase, and sees the land itself, as well as special sites like Bear Butte , as sacred. Numerous Cheyenne work as foresters and fire fighters. This spiritual perspective is evident in traditional communities like Lame Deer and Birney and when the 2006 vote on development coal and coalbed methane on the reservation split along modernist vs traditional lines. [ incomplete short citation ] A historical buffalo jump, burial sites of Cheyenne chiefs and spiritual leaders, the site of Custer 's last camp before the Battle of the Little Bighorn , the Cheyenne Indian Museum, Ten Bears Gallery, St. Labre Indian School , and the Ashland Powwow are sites of special interest in the Ashland area. The Northern Cheyenne are related to the Southern Cheyenne , who are located in Oklahoma . Following the Black Hills War and earlier conflicts in Colorado (see Sand Creek Massacre and Washita Massacre ), the Northern Cheyenne were forcibly moved to Oklahoma and restricted to lands of their southern relatives. Unable to acclimate swiftly to the heat of western Oklahoma ( Indian Territory at the time), having to grow their food instead of hunting or gathering as were their ways, and the brutal conditions in the barracks where they were held, the northerners quickly began dying.

The parkway leaves Cunningham Park, entering the Bellerose section of Queens, entering exit 22, which connects to Union Turnpike via Stronghurst Avenue. The route then enters Alley Pond Park , where it interchanges with the Cross Island Parkway and Winchester Boulevard. After the interchange, the Grand Central passes west of Creedmoor Hospital , winding northeast into exit 24, which serves Little Neck Parkway before winding northeast to the Nassau County line in Little Neck . At this crossing, the parkway changes names to the Northern State Parkway , which continues east towards Hauppauge . History The Grand Central Parkway was first proposed in 1922, as a scenic drive along the high ground of east-central Queens. By the time construction began in 1931, it had been reconceived as extending northwestward to the Triborough Bridge, then in the planning stages, and connecting on the east with the Northern State Parkway, also in the planning stages, thereby among other things providing an easier route from the bridge to Jones Beach . The parkway was widened in 1961 in preparation for the 1964 New York World's Fair in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park . In 2010 construction began at Kew Gardens Interchange to improve traffic congestion. Formerly, the frontage road of the Grand Central between BQE and the RFK Bridge served as a truck route, since large trucks were not permitted on the parkway. Exemptions were provided for smaller trucks that conform with strict regulations on the section of the Grand Central that overlapped with I-278. In December 2017, the state concluded a $2.5 million project that lowered the roadbed of the section of the parkway that is concurrent with I-278. This section of I-278 now has a 14-foot (4.3 m) vertical clearance, which allows most trucks to stay on I-278.
