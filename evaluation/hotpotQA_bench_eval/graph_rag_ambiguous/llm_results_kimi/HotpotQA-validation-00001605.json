History The colonnade viewed from the east entrance to Trinity Square Gardens The IWGC sought advice on the form of the memorial from the seafarers' unions, who consistently requested a memorial in the form of a home for aged seamen or similar, but the commission was set against functional memorials in the belief that they became associated more with their function than with commemoration. It rejected the request, overruling its own advisory committee in doing so, on the grounds that its charter did not allow it to fund the ongoing costs of an institution. It insisted that merchant seamen would be commemorated on a monument. The commission first intended to site the memorial at Temple Steps, on the bank of the River Thames , for which it commissioned Lutyens. The architect designed a massive arch. The proposed structure would have consisted of two 54-foot (16-metre) stone piers of linked, alternating arches (reminiscent of the Thiepval Memorial, which he was designing for the IWGC at around the same time) joined by a large beam, itself supported by two Doric columns between the arches. This was approved by London County Council , but the Office of Works rejected it on the advice of the Royal Fine Arts Commission (RFAC), which objected on two grounds: first, that Lutyens' proposal would involve the demolition of an arch built when the Thames Embankment was constructed; and second, that the memorial would be better suited to a site further downstream, east of Tower Bridge , where it would be seen by ocean-going vessels which could not travel west of the bridge. Both Lutyens and Ware attempted to persuade the RFAC to reconsider but to no avail. Lutyens was furious, feeling the merchant seamen had been relegated to \"some hole in the corner because they happened to be low in social status\" and that Sir Reginald Blomfield (a member of the RFAC and a rival of Lutyens) was acting out of spite. Lutyens described the RFAC's opinion as \"bosh\", and suggested to Ware that they should continue regardless and force a confrontation. Ware was more diplomatic, and the IWGC chose a new site in Trinity Square Gardens on Tower Hill , still west of Tower Bridge but further from the river. This site was considered appropriate because it was within sight of the Thames, albeit not on the riverbank, and the area already had maritime connections, including the headquarters of the Port of London Authority at 10 Trinity Square , Trinity House , and the church of All Hallows-by-the-Tower (itself home to many nautically themed memorials). Philip Longworth, in a history of the IWGC, remarked that the location meant the commission's only memorial in London \"would never be seen by most Londoners, still less",

After training at Melbourne's National Gallery of Victoria Art School , where she studied alongside Frederick McCubbin and Jane Sutherland , Rae travelled to France in 1887 with her family, and spent most of the rest of her life there. A longstanding member of the Étaples art colony , Rae lived in or near the village of Étaples from the 1890s until the 1930s. During that period, Rae exhibited her paintings at the Royal Society of British Artists , the Society of Oil Painters , and the Paris Salon . During World War I , she was a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment and worked throughout the war in Étaples Army Base Camp. She and Jessie Traill were the only Australian women to live and paint in France during the war, however they were not included in their country's first group of official war artists . Following Hitler's rise to power, Rae moved to south-eastern England, where she died in 1940.

Mason Firth & McCutcheon. Printers, Melbourne 1885. Private Collection Rae was born on 18 August 1860 in Melbourne , youngest daughter of Scottish emigrants Thomas Rae, a manufacturer and later a state politician, and his wife Janet Love. She was the granddaughter of the Reverend Andrew Love and Catherine Love of Geelong, Victoria, Australia. Rae studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1877 to 1887, where fellow students included Rupert Bunny and John Longstaff . Her teachers included George Folingsby and Oswald Rose Campbell. Rae had some academic success in student exhibitions, receiving prizes and recognition from the judging panel on several occasions, alongside fellow students such as Longstaff, Frederick McCubbin , Jane Sutherland and May Vale . Rae joined, and exhibited with, the Victorian Academy of Arts between 1881 and 1883. Subsequently, she joined the Buonarotti Club 's creative intellectual and social activities and plein air artist camps. In 1887, Rae travelled to France and settled in Paris with her mother Janet and sister Alison. They lived there for three years, before the family moved to the artists' colony at the fishing village of Étaples , in northern coastal France. During this initial part of her career, Rae exhibited works in Australia and New Zealand, though she remained in Europe. Exhibitions in which she was hung included the 1889 New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin , and the 1896 Victorian Artists' Society, at which several of her landscapes were shown.

Had observation given 27 Kelvins instead of 2.7 Kelvins for the temperature, then 27 kelvins would have been entered in the catalogue. Or 0.27 Kelvins. Or anything at all. — Hoyle, 1994 Theory of gravity Together with Narlikar , Hoyle developed a particle theory in the 1960s, the Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity . It made predictions that were roughly the same as Einstein's general relativity , but it incorporated Mach's Principle , which Einstein had tried but failed to incorporate in his theory. The Hoyle-Narlikar theory fails several tests, including consistency with the microwave background. It was motivated by their belief in the steady-state model of the universe. Rejection of Earth-based abiogenesis In his later years, Hoyle became a staunch critic of theories of abiogenesis to explain the origin of life on Earth. With Chandra Wickramasinghe , Hoyle promoted the hypothesis that the first life on Earth began in space, spreading through the universe via panspermia , and that evolution on Earth is influenced by a steady influx of viruses arriving via comets . His belief that comets had a significant percentage of organic compounds was well ahead of his time, as the dominant views in the 1970s and 1980s were that comets largely consisted of water-ice, and the presence of organic compounds was then highly controversial. Wickramasinghe wrote in 2003: \"In the highly polarized polemic between Darwinism and creationism , our position is unique. Although we do not align ourselves with either side, both sides treat us as opponents. Thus we are outsiders with an unusual perspective—and our suggestion for a way out of the crisis has not yet been considered.\" Hoyle and Wickramasinghe advanced several instances where they say outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the 1918 flu pandemic , and certain outbreaks of polio and mad cow disease . For the 1918 flu pandemic, they hypothesized that cometary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations—a view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. In 1982, Hoyle presented Evolution from Space for the Royal Institution's Omni Lecture. After considering what he thought of as a very remote possibility of Earth-based abiogenesis he concluded: If one proceeds directly and straightforwardly in this matter, without being deflected by a fear of incurring the wrath of scientific opinion, one arrives at the conclusion that biomaterials with their amazing measure of order must be the outcome of intelligent design . No other possibility I have been able to think of... — Fred Hoyle Published in his 1982/1984 books Evolution from Space (co-authored with Chandra",

      "text": "an atom through the blind forces of nature would be utterly minuscule. A common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature. The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question.\" — Fred Hoyle His co-worker William Alfred Fowler eventually won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1983 (with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar ), but Hoyle's original contribution was overlooked by the electors, and many were surprised that such a notable astronomer missed out. Fowler himself in an autobiographical sketch affirmed Hoyle's pioneering efforts: The concept of nucleosynthesis in stars was first established by Hoyle in 1946. This provided a way to explain the existence of elements heavier than helium in the universe, basically by showing that critical elements such as carbon could be generated in stars and then incorporated in other stars and planets when that star \" dies \". The new stars formed now start off with these heavier elements and even heavier elements are formed from them. Hoyle theorized that other rarer elements could be explained by supernovas , the giant explosions which occasionally occur throughout the universe, whose temperatures and pressures would be required to create such elements. — William Fowler Rejection of the Big Bang Hoyle in 1988 While having no argument with the Lemaître theory (later confirmed by Edwin Hubble 's observations) that the universe was expanding, Hoyle disagreed on its interpretation. He found the idea that the universe had a beginning to be pseudoscience , resembling arguments for a creator, \"for it's an irrational process, and can't be described in scientific terms\" (see Kalam cosmological argument ). Instead, Hoyle, along with Thomas Gold and Hermann Bondi (with whom he had worked on radar in the Second World War ), in 1948 began to argue for the universe as being in a \"steady state\" and formulated their Steady State theory . The theory tried to explain how the universe could be eternal and essentially unchanging while still having the galaxies we observe moving away from each other. The theory hinged on the creation of matter between galaxies over time, so that even though galaxies get further apart, new ones that develop between them fill the space they leave. The resulting universe is in a \"steady state\" in the same manner that a flowing river is—the individual water molecules are moving away but the overall river remains the same. The theory was one alternative to the Big Bang which, like the Big Bang, agreed with key observations of the day, namely Hubble's red shift observations , and Hoyle was a strong critic of the Big Bang. He coined the term \"Big Bang\" on BBC radio's Third Programme broadcast on 28 March 1949. It was said by George Gamow and his opponents that Hoyle intended to",

      "text": "Aphra Behn ( / ˈ æ f r ə b ɛ n / ; bapt. 14 December 1640 – 16 April 1689) was an English playwright , poet, prose writer and translator from the Restoration era . As one of the first English women to earn her living by her writing, she broke cultural barriers and served as a literary role model for later generations of women authors. Rising from obscurity, she came to the notice of Charles II , who employed her as a spy in Antwerp . Upon her return to London and a probable brief stay in debtors' prison , she began writing for the stage. She belonged to a coterie of poets and famous libertines such as John Wilmot, Lord Rochester . Behn wrote under the pastoral pseudonym Astrea . During the turbulent political times of the Exclusion Crisis , she wrote an epilogue and prologue that brought her legal trouble; she thereafter devoted most of her writing to prose genres and translations. A staunch supporter of the Stuart line, Behn declined an invitation from Bishop Burnet to write a welcoming poem to the new king William III . She died shortly after. She is remembered in Virginia Woolf 's A Room of One's Own : \"All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn which is, most scandalously but rather appropriately, in Westminster Abbey , for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds.\" Her grave is not included in the Poets' Corner but lies in the East Cloister near the steps to the church. Her best-known works are Oroonoko: or, the Royal Slave , sometimes described as an early novel , and the play The Rover . Life and work Versions of her early life Information regarding Behn's life is scant, especially regarding her early years. This may be due to intentional obscuring on Behn's part. One version of Behn's life tells that she was born to a barber named John Amis and his wife Amy; she is occasionally referred to as Aphra Amis Behn . Another story has Behn born to a couple named Cooper. The Histories and Novels of the Late Ingenious Mrs. Behn (1696) states that Behn was born to Bartholomew Johnson, a barber, and Elizabeth Denham, a wet-nurse . Colonel Thomas Colepeper, the only person who claimed to have known her as a child, wrote in Adversaria that she was born at \" Sturry or Canterbury \" to a Mr Johnson and that she had a sister named Frances. Another contemporary, Anne Finch , wrote that Behn was born in Wye in Kent , the \"Daughter to a Barber\". In some accounts the profile of her father fits Eaffrey Johnson. Although not much is known about her early childhood, one of her biographers, Janet Todd , believes that the common religious upbringing at the",

In 1780, using a frog, he discovered that the muscles of dead frogs' legs twitched when struck by an electrical spark. This was an early study of bioelectricity , following experiments by John Walsh and Hugh Williamson . Early life and career Luigi Galvani was born to goldsmith Domenico Galvani and Barbara Caterina Foschi, in Bologna , then part of the Papal States . A portion of his childhood home still stands in the Giardino Salvatore Pincherle. In 1759, Galvani graduated with a degree in medicine and philosophy and began to practice medicine at nearby hospitals. He published his first work, a paper on the anatomy and physiology of bones, in 1762, when he was 25 years old. Galvani presented the work at the Archiginnasio di Bologna , which allowed him to start lecturing at the Academy of Sciences of the Institue of Bologna (now part of the University of Bologna ) where he taught anatomy for most of his career. In 1766, Galvani was appointed curator of the anatomical museum by the senate of Bologna. This position \"required him to give lectures and demonstrations of anatomical operations before surgeons, painters and sculptors.\" In 1782, he was appointed Professor of Obstetric Arts , which he remained for the next 16 years. Animal electricity Galvani then began taking an interest in the field of \"medical electricity\". This field emerged in the middle of the 18th century, following electrical researches and the discovery of the effects of electricity on the human body by scientists including Bertrand Bajon and Ramón María Termeyer in the 1760s, and by John Walsh and Hugh Williamson in the 1770s. The publication in 1791 of Galvani’s main work ( De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius ), summarizing and discussing more than 10 years of research on the effect of electricity on animal preparations, had an enormous impact on the scientific community and sparked heated controversy in Europe.

It was said by George Gamow and his opponents that Hoyle intended to be pejorative, and the script from which he read aloud was interpreted by his opponents to be \"vain, one-sided, insulting, not worthy of the BBC\". Hoyle explicitly denied that he was being insulting and said it was just a striking image meant to emphasise the difference between the two theories for the radio audience. In another BBC interview, he said, \"The reason why scientists like the \"Big Bang\" is because they are overshadowed by the Book of Genesis. It is deep within the psyche of most scientists to believe in the first page of Genesis\". Hoyle had a famously heated argument with Martin Ryle of the Cavendish Radio Astronomy Group about Hoyle's steady state theory, which somewhat restricted collaboration between the Cavendish group and the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy during the 1960s. Hoyle, unlike Gold and Bondi, offered an explanation for the appearance of new matter by postulating the existence of what he dubbed the \"creation field\", or just the \"C-field\", which had negative pressure in order to be consistent with the conservation of energy and drive the expansion of the universe. This C-field is the same as the later \"de Sitter solution\" for cosmic inflation , but the C-field model acts much slower than the de Sitter inflation model. They jointly argued that continuous creation was no more inexplicable than the appearance of the entire universe from nothing, although it had to be done on a regular basis. In the end, mounting observational evidence convinced most cosmologists that the steady-state model was incorrect and that the Big Bang theory agreed better with observations, although Hoyle continued to support and develop his theory. In 1993, in an attempt to explain some of the evidence against the steady-state theory, he presented a modified version called \" quasi-steady state cosmology \" (QSS), but the theory is not widely accepted. The evidence that resulted in the Big Bang's victory over the steady-state model included discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in the 1960s, and the distribution of \"young galaxies\" and quasars throughout the Universe in the 1980s indicate a more consistent age estimate of the universe. Hoyle died in 2001 having never accepted the validity of the Big Bang theory. How, in the big-bang cosmology, is the microwave background explained?

Sculptor The Livesey Hall War Memorial was designed and sculpted by the British artist Sydney March. The son of George and Elizabeth March, he was born in 1876 in Stoneferry , a suburb of Hull , East Riding of Yorkshire, England. He was the second of nine children, eight of whom became artists. As a child, Sydney March worked as a monumental sculptor's apprentice. Later, he attended the Royal Academy Schools , where he won first prize in 1900. March exhibited thirteen times at The Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts between 1906 and 1932. His family established studios at their home of Goddendene in Farnborough , Kent after 1901. Sydney March was a prolific artist whose primary focus was war memorials, as well as sculptures of British royalty and other contemporary figures. He and his siblings completed the National War Memorial of Canada after the 1930 death of their brother, sculptor Vernon March . Other monuments for which he is renowned include the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers South African War Memorial in Northern Ireland, the United Empire Loyalist Monument in Canada, and the Lancaster Monument in England. Smaller-scale pieces include the portrait busts of King Edward VII and Cecil John Rhodes , both in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Sydney March died in 1968 at the age of 92. His ashes were interred in the family plot at St Giles the Abbot Churchyard in Farnborough. In 1922, Sydney had sculpted the bronze angel monument that marks the March plot. Theft of plaques In October 2011, the three bronze plaques from the front of the monument were stolen. Police in the Greater London area reported in late 2011 that incidents of metal theft began about 2006, and had increased since then.

Over the next decade he systematically explored the phenomenon, culminating in his 1791 treatise *De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari*, which ignited Europe-wide debate and laid foundations for electrophysiology. Galvani spent his career in Bologna, teaching anatomy and obstetrics while curating the city’s anatomical museum. His work, building on earlier findings by Walsh and Williamson, ultimately inspired Volta’s invention of the battery and the term “galvanize.”  \n\n**Keywords**: animal electricity, frog experiments, bioelectricity, electrophysiology, galvanism",
