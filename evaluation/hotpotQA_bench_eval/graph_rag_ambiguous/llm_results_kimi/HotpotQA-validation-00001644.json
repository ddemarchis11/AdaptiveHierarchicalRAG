      "text": "The West Alabama Tigers football program is the intercollegiate American football team for the University of West Alabama located in the U.S. state of Alabama . The team competes in the NCAA Division II and is a member of the Gulf South Conference . West Alabama's first football team was fielded in 1938. The team plays its home games at the 7,000 seat Tiger Stadium in Livingston, Alabama . The Tigers are coached by Scott Cochran . History West Alabama's football team was first fielded in 1931 when the school was known as Livingston State Teachers College. However, intercollegiate competition for all the university’s athletics was not scheduled until seven years later. In 1938, they competed in four games against Marion Institute , Jacksonville State , Demopolis A.S, and Troy State , all of whom were local teams. LSTC finished the season 2-2. That year also marked the start of World War II which led to a decline in college enrollment across the United States. Therefore, LSTC fielded no athletic teams from 1942 to 1945. In 1944, Dr. William Wilson Hill became president of the university and instantly started recruiting students to enroll. The return of males to campus reestablished an interest in sports. After a three-year hiatus, the football team returned to action under the guidance of new head coach E.G McCollum. They opened their season with the first of many future match-ups against Mississippi College , which resulted in a 24–14 loss. Also, that season, LSTC renewed its rivalry with, eventual Gulf South Conference foes, Troy State and Delta State . The team concluded the season with a 6–3 record. Due to success of the season, McCollum resigned to pursue a bigger opportunity elsewhere. Following two dismal seasons from 1947 and 1948, LSTC made a bold move and hired former University of Alabama star Vaughn Mancha as the fourth head coach in team history. Mancha at the time was only 28 years old with no prior coaching experience. The former two-time All-American had also recently completed his first and only season in the NFL as a member of the Boston Yanks. Under Mancha, the team experienced immediate success. In his first season, he led LSTC to one of the biggest accomplishments in school history, a 13–6 win over Florida State . The team also concluded the regular season 7-1-1, which at the time marked the best record in school history. The historical season earned LSTC right to play in the Paper Bowl against Jacksonville State. JSU won the hard-fought defensive affair, 12–7. Until 1952, the Tigers played home games at Livingston High School. From then on, all their home games were played at Tiger Stadium , a 7,000-capacity stadium located on filled in land that was previously known as",

They were then upset by Georgia at Birmingham before playing both Mississippi A&M and Georgia Tech to ties on the road. After a victory over Marion Military Institute in their final road game of the season, Alabama closed the season with victories over both Tulane and Davidson and an upset loss to Sewanee . Schedule Before the season On June 21, 1911, Kansas State Agricultural College (now known as Kansas State University ) announced Alabama head coach and athletic director Guy Lowman had been hired to serve in the same capacities at Kansas State. After a month-long search, on July 21, university president John Abercrombie offered the job of professor of physical training and athletic director to D. V. Graves to which he accepted immediately via telegraph . The appointment was inclusive of him serving as head coach of all athletic teams at Alabama, including football.

He tried a few other schools including Georgia Tech , for which he was one day late, before ultimately enrolling at the University of Alabama as a 20-year-old freshman. University of Alabama Pooley initially played tackle in college, but was eventually put in the backfield where he excelled at fullback and quarterback .

In six different games he scored at least three touchdowns, and had 35 in all.

A couple of wins over #22 Delta State and Arkansas-Monticello put UWA right back in the thick of the playoff race, but a loss to West Georgia the following week nearly derailed their hopes. During the season finale, UWA was locked in a battle for their playoff lives against longtime rival and Wallace’s former team, North Alabama. At the time, UNA was ranked #1 in all the Division II polls. Through a fearless and courageous effort, UWA sent the game to overtime after losing the lead they held throughout the game. After four overtimes, it appeared UNA was set to claim the victory until a forced fumble gave UWA the ball. From that, they took advantage and kicked the game-winning field goal. It was the first win for the Tigers at Braly Municipal Stadium in Florence since the 1987 season. The NCAA rewarded UWA's efforts with a berth in the NCAA Division II playoffs . In the first round, the Tigers upset #20 Albany State 24–22 on the road. After falling behind early against #10 Carson-Newman, the Tigers mounted a rally before falling short 59–41. The Tigers gathered an 8–5 record, the most wins since 1975, and had eight All-GSC honors. UWA posted a 5–1 record at Tiger Stadium, the best since 1985, and tallied the most wins over GSC opponents since 1981 with six. They received their first two rankings in school history at the end of the season. The AFCA placed them #21 , while the D2Football.com poll placed them higher two spots at #19 .

The incident prompted Drake to leave the Missouri Valley Conference for decades and spurred NCAA rule changes for player safety. Despite a broken jaw, Bright finished his collegiate career with record-setting totals, became a first-team All-American, and later dominated the Canadian Football League as the CFL’s all-time leading rusher and 1959 Most Outstanding Player. After retiring from football, Bright worked as an educator and principal in Edmonton, where he became a Canadian citizen and community icon; schools and stadiums in both Iowa and Alberta now bear his name.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nJohnny Bright Incident, racial violence, NCAA rule change, CFL rushing leader, Drake University legacy",
