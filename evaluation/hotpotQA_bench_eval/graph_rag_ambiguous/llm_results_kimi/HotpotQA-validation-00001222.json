Owned and operated by the City of Tallahassee, it serves as the primary airport for Florida's capital city and the surrounding Big Bend region. Despite its designation as an \" international airport \", TLH currently does not offer scheduled international passenger flights. The international status was granted in 2015 following the installation of a federal customs and border protection facility, enabling it to handle international cargo and charter flights. As of 2024, the airport provides commercial passenger service through several major airlines, including American Airlines , Delta Air Lines , and Silver Airways , offering nonstop flights to key hubs such as Atlanta , Charlotte , Dallas/Fort Worth , and Miami . With annual passenger traffic averaging between 850,000 and 900,000, Tallahassee International Airport ranks as one of the smaller commercial airports in Florida, yet remains a crucial transportation hub for the northern part of the state.

      "text": "Eastern Airways was a British regional airline headquartered at Humberside Airport near the village of Kirmington , North Lincolnshire , England. The airline operated domestic, international and private charter flights. Around 1,300,000 passengers flew with the airline per rolling year including on services for KLM Cityhopper, charter operations, and government subsidised public service obligation (PSO) services which would otherwise be commercially unfeasible. The airline had its own hubs in Aberdeen and Humberside . Air Kilroe held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence. It was permitted to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats and was IOSA approved. History Early years Co-founded by Bryan Huxford and Richard Lake, the airline started operations in December 1997 with a scheduled route between Humberside and Aberdeen with a leased Swearingen Metro , following KLM UK's withdrawal from the route. In February 1999, it purchased Manchester based Air Kilroe , thereby acquiring an air operator's certificate and a fleet of two BAe Jetstream 32 aircraft. In 2002, the first BAe Jetstream 41 entered the Eastern fleet, the aircraft type which formed the majority of the fleet up until the airline ceased operations. 12 aircraft and their associated routes were transferred from British Airways CitiExpress on 30 March 2003. An Embraer 145 and 135 were also wet-leased from City Airline in 2003, which were then replaced with Saab 2000 aircraft, which peaked at 8 being operated by 2013 including acquisitions from Crossair and other European carriers. In 2006, Eastern Airways wet-leased a Dornier 328 from Cirrus Airlines for six months to operate a Newcastle to London City service before switching this onto the BAe Jetstream 41. Eastern Airways also purchased a Jetstream 41 training simulator . As part of One NorthEast 's \"Passionate People Passionate Places\" campaign for North East England , Eastern Airways had a Jetstream 41 painted in promotional colours. It also featured in the 2007 Sunderland International Airshow . A Saab 2000 was also painted in a promotional 'Aberdeen City and Shire' colour scheme. The airline shut down its hub at the Isle of Man in August 2009, discontinuing routes to Birmingham and Newcastle from the airport. 2010s In July 2010, the airline took delivery of an Embraer 135 with 37 seats and signed a lease on a second, thus adding jet aircraft to their fleet for the first time since the acquisition to replace their previously operated Embraer ERJ aircraft. They were to be used mainly on charter services to central and Eastern Europe; however, they also offered increased flexibility on the airline's scheduled flights. In July 2010, the airline named one of their BAe Jetstream 41 aircraft",
