Since the marriage lasted only 100 days, they never filed the paperwork to legally register it, so their short-lived marriage remains a secret. Meanwhile, Sang-hyo has caught the eye of her boss Jo Sung-gyeom ( Namkoong Min ), a strict but thoughtful hotel managing director who has all the female employees swooning. But there's also ambitious public relations manager Yeo Eun-joo ( Lee Young-eun ), who competes with Sang-hyo for both a promotion and Sung-gyeom's heart.
