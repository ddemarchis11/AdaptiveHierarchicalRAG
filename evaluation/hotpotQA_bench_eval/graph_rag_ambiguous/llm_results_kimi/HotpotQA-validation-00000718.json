Gjergj Fishta and the Scutarine Catholic School of Letters led by Fishta significantly contributed to this blossoming. The Ghegs are known for their epic poetry . The revival of Catholicism among Albanians gave a new and important impulse to the rise of Gheg culture. Physical anthropology The typical Gheg has been described as an immense tall male normally averaging 183cm in height, characterized by long limbs, a strong skeletal framework, and well-developed musculature, resulting in a generally spare and lean build. The face is thin and bony, of moderate dimensions, yet set within a distinctly hyperbrachycephalic cranial structure, producing a short and broad head that is often flattened posteriorly. Facial features include a long, narrow, aquiline nose. Facial hair is typically well developed, with mustache and beard present and varying in color. Skin tone is light, eye color is mixed, and body hair is only moderately developed. Kosovo Army by 2025. Gheg Albanian Policeman According to Pettifer & Vickers in 2007, \"Ghegs speak a slightly different dialect of the language, and are often taller and thinner than Tosks, but these traditional differences (often exaggerated in vulgar anthropology) have been much diminished by population movement in the post-communist period.\" History Pre-Ottoman and Ottoman period There was a distinction between Ghegs and Tosks before the Ottomans appeared in Albania at the end of the 14th century. The Ghegs remained out of the reach of the regular Ottoman civil administration until the end of Ottoman rule. In areas where Ghegs were still tribesmen they followed their own laws and lived an autonomous existence. The fact that the tribes of northern Albania were not completely subdued by the Ottomans is raised to the level of orthodoxy among the members of the tribes. A possible explanation is that the Ottomans did not have any real interest in subduing the northern Albanian tribes because they were more useful to them as a stable source of mercenaries. The Ottomans implemented the bayraktar system within northern Albanian tribes, and granted some privileges to the bayraktars (banner chiefs) in exchange for their obligation to mobilize local fighters to support military actions of the Ottoman forces . During the late Ottoman period Ghegs often lacked education and integration within the Ottoman system, while they had autonomy and military capabilities. Those factors gave the area of Gegënia an importance within the empire that differed from Toskëria. Still many Ottoman officers thought that Ghegs, in particular the highlanders were often a liability instead of an asset for the state being commonly referred to as \"wild\" ( Turkish : vahşi ).

In areas of Albania where Malësors (highlanders) lived, the empire only posted Ottoman officers who had prior experience of service in other tribal regions of the state like Kurdistan or Yemen that could bridge cultural divides with Gheg tribesmen. The Great Eastern Crisis resulted in Albanian resistance to partition by neighbouring powers with the formation of the Prizren League (1878) which issued a Kararname (memorandum) that declared both Ghegs and Tosks had made an oath to defend the state and homeland in the name of Islam. During the crisis Ghegs and Tosks made besas (pledges of honor) to arm themselves and shed blood to defend their rights. Better armed than its southern Tosk counterpart, Gheg society was in a more effective position to resist the redrawing of borders in the region. Ottoman officials initially assisted Gheg Albanians in their efforts to resist incorporation of their lands into Serbia, Montenegro or Bulgaria. Ghegs experienced a brief moment of an autonomous administration where local tax was collected into Albanian coffers. Calls for an autonomous united Albania made sultan Abdul Hamid II suppress the League of Prizren movement, especially after Gheg Albanians revolted in 1881 and posed a military challenge to Ottoman authority. Large parts of Gegënia posed a security problem for the Ottoman Empire, due to the tribalism of Gheg society and limited state control. Gheg freedoms were tolerated by Abdul Hamid II and he enlisted them in his palace guard, integrated the sons of local notables from urban areas into the bureaucracy and co-opted leaders like Isa Boletini into the Ottoman system. During the Young Turk Revolution (1908) some Ghegs were one group in Albanian society that gave its support for the restoration of the Ottoman constitution of 1876 to end the Hamidian regime. Subsequent centralising policies and militarism toward the Albanian Question by the new Young Turk government resulted in four years of local revolts by Ghegs who fought to keep tribal privileges and the defense system of kulas (tower houses). Ghegs from the Shkodër region supported the Greçë Memorandum that called for Albanian sociopolitical rights within the Ottoman Empire during the Albanian revolt of 1911 . On the eve of the Balkan Wars (1912-1913) Gheg and Tosk Albanians managed to secure two concessions from the Ottoman government: the rights of Albanian ethnicity and rights for the highlander population during the Albanian revolt of 1912 .

      "text": "Marriage was basically an economic and political deal arranged among the members of the tribe, while those who got married had no say in the matter. Sworn virginity was occasionally practised among the Ghegs. Child betrothal was also practised by the Ghegs, sometimes even before birth. Religion Christianity in Albania was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome until the eighth century. Then, dioceses in Albania were transferred to the patriarchate of Constantinople . In 1054 after the schism, the north became identified with the Roman Catholic Church . Since that time all churches north of the Shkumbin river were Catholic and under the jurisdiction of the Pope. Various reasons have been put forward for the spread of Catholicism among northern Albanians. Traditional affiliation with the Latin rite and Catholic missions in central Albania in the 12th century fortified the Catholic Church against Orthodoxy, while local leaders found an ally in Catholicism against Slavic Orthodox states. During the Ottoman period in the history of Albania (1385–1912), the majority of Albanians converted to Islam. Today, the majority of Ghegs are Sunni Muslims , with a large minority being Catholic. Catholic Albanians are most heavily concentrated in northwestern Albania and the Malësia region of southeastern Montenegro , in both of which they form of a majority of population, while they have a thinner distribution in central Albania and northeastern Albania and Kosovo. There are also Ghegs who practice Orthodox Christianity, mainly living in the southwest of the Gheg-speaking region, especially Durrës (where they formed 36% of the population in 1918) and Elbasan (where they formed 17% of the population in 1918). Orthodox Ghegs were traditionally also heavily concentrated in the region of Upper Reka (Reka e Epërme) in North Macedonia. There are also some groups of Ghegs who practice Bektashism , living in areas such as Kruja and Bulqiza . Additionally, as is the case with all Albanians as a legacy of the Enver Hoxha regime, many people don't identify with any faith, and a large number of people do not usually attend the services of any religion. Culture Albanian wedding ceremony in Valbona , northern Albania After the Tanzimat reforms in the second half of the 19th century, aiming to gain influence over Catholic Albanians, Austria-Hungary , with Ottoman approval, opened and financed many schools in the Albanian language, and Franciscan seminaries and hospitals, and trained native clergy, which all resulted in the development of literature in the Albanian language .

It was founded in 1949 by Dr. Sultan Ahmad, Dr. Muzzafar Ahmed, Dr. Abu Bakar, Prof. Ahsan-ul-Islam, and Prof. Waiz Hussain Bokhari, and is hosted by Government College in Lahore . The society receives funding from the Pakistan Science Foundation , part of the Ministry of Science and Technology . History The Biological Society of Pakistan was founded in 1949 under the auspices of the Pakistan Association for the Advancement of Science , by a group of biologists in Lahore , working at the zoology and botany departments of Government College and Punjab University , which at the time were housed in the same Government College building. The society's founding charter states the objective of promoting the cause of biological sciences in Pakistan, by publishing an academic journal (to be called Pakistan Journal of Biology ), holding meetings, seminars and conferences to discuss biological problems, and creating facilities for original research in biological sciences. The society was registered on 10 April 1955 under the Societies Act XXI of 1860 of the Punjab, with an initial membership of 142 scientists from across Pakistan. Mian Afzal Hussain was elected as the first president, with Nazir Ahmad as secretary and Sher Ahmad Lodhi as its treasurer. In 1955, the scientists and teachers working in the botany and zoology department at Government College and Punjab University decided to rename the society the Biological Society of Pakistan and to publish a regular research journal. Ahsan-ul-Islam was assigned the job of framing the bylaws of the society and M. Saleem was assigned the task of enrolling the members of the society. Sultan Ahmad with Muzaffar Ahmad took over responsibility for the publication of the journal.

The plane had previously been operated as part of the Trump Shuttle fleet until a 1992 merger. Donald Trump re-purchased the aircraft in 1997 and used it until 2011, when he sold it in favor of the 757. The 727 included a private quarters with a queen-size bed and full bath and seating for 23 passengers in three separate salons.

Trump's DJT Operations I LLC bought the plane in 2011. The aircraft has two Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engines, and is configured to seat 43 people. It has a dining room, bathroom, shower, bedroom, guest room, and galley. Many fixtures are plated in 24-karat gold. Donald Trump had planned to use the 757 for campaigning during his exploratory, ultimately abandoned 2012 presidential bid. He used the 757 for transportation during his successful 2016 presidential campaign . After becoming president, he began to travel on the Boeing VC-25s commonly referred to as Air Force One , including the use for transportation during his unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign . In December 2016, the aircraft received the call sign 'Tyson 1'. The Boeing 757 was used by The Trump Organization for executive trips until mid-2019 when it was put into storage on a fenced-off tarmac at Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, New York where it remained until late 2021. The left engine was removed, and there were challenges in finding a replacement/loaner engine.

      "text": "other camp residents. The audience was enthusiastic but the Group's leadership, Strasberg in particular, still opposed producing it. Until his debut as a playwright, Odets continued to train as an actor with the Group at its various summer rehearsal headquarters in the Connecticut countryside and upstate New York. In addition to Brookfield Center and Green Mansions, these venues included Dover Furnace in Dutchess County (1932) and a large house in the Catskill village of Ellenville (1934). The Group spent the summer of 1936 at Pine Brook Country Club in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Its final summer retreat was at Lake Grove, in Smithtown, New York, in 1939. Odets's exposure to Strasberg's philosophy was essential to his development as a playwright. He said in an interview late in life, \"My chief influence as a playwright was the Group Theatre acting company, and being a member of that company ... And you can see the Group Theatre acting technique crept right into the plays.\" Odets became the first produced Method-trained playwright with his first publicly presented play, the one-act Waiting for Lefty , on January 6, 1935, at the former Civic Repertory Theatre on Fourteenth Street in New York City. The occasion was a benefit performance for New Theatre Magazine . Like Lawson, a member of the Communist Party, Odets was by this time influenced by Marxism and his plays became increasingly political. Waiting for Lefty was inspired by the 1934 New York City taxi strike and is written in the format of a minstrel show with interconnected scenes depicting social and economic dilemmas of workers in various fields. The focus alternates between a union meeting of taxi drivers and vignettes from the workers' fraught lives. A young medical intern falls victim to anti-Semitism; a laboratory assistant's job is threatened if he refuses to spy on a colleague; couples are thwarted in marriage and torn apart by the hopelessness of economic conditions caused by the Depression. The climax is a defiant call for the taxi drivers' union to strike, which brought the entire opening night audience to its feet with tumultuous applause. The play does not require a proscenium stage and can be performed in any acting space, including union meeting halls and on the street. Waiting for Lefty' s unexpectedly wild success brought Odets international fame, though its strong pro-union bent caused it to be banned in many U.S. towns and cities. It was produced by a number of left-wing theaters in Britain, Australia, and other English-speaking countries, and has been widely translated. Awake and Sing! was written in 1933 and finally produced by the Group Theatre in February 1935 after the success of Waiting for Lefty . This first of Odets's full-length plays is generally regarded as his masterpiece and has been cited as \"the earliest quintessential Jewish play outside the Yiddish theatre.\" The play concerns the Berger family,",

      "text": "The Ghegs (also spelled Gegs ; Albanian : Gegët ) are one of the two main dialectal subgroups of Albanians , alongside the Tosks . These groups are distinguished by their linguistic characteristics. The Ghegs live in Albania (north of the Shkumbin river), Kosovo , North Macedonia , Serbia and Montenegro . The Ghegs speak Gheg Albanian , one of the two main dialects of Albanian language . The social organization of the Ghegs was traditionally tribal , with several distinct tribal groups of Ghegs. The Ottoman Empire annexed and ruled the Tosk-inhabited south at the beginning of the 15th century, while the territory populated by Ghegs remained out of the reach of the regular Ottoman civil administration until the beginning of the 20th century. As a consequence, the Ghegs evolved isolated from the Tosks. Similarly, the Islamization of the Ghegs was incomplete, with a large area of northwestern Albania remaining Catholic. The Ottomans never completely subdued the northern Albanian tribes of Ghegs because they were more useful to them as a stable source of mercenaries. Instead, they implemented the bayraktar system, and granted some privileges to the bayraktars (banner chiefs) in exchange for their obligation to mobilize local fighters to support military actions of the Ottoman forces .  Terminology Proper Gegnia (the land of the Gegë ) is located north of the Shkumbin river along its right bank and extends up to modern border between Mat and Mirdita , where Leknia begins. Leknia itself is bordered to the north by Malësia . None of these regions overlap with one another and each has its own self-identification. This is reflected in the fact that only the people of proper Gegnia call themselves Gegë , while moving northwards it is not a form of regional self-identification. For example, the people of the Dukagjin highlands when asked about their regional appellation would reply na nuk jemi gegë, gegët janë përtej maleve (we are not Gheghs, the Ghegs live beyond the mountains). The popular perception in non-Albanian literature of all northern Albanians as Ghegs is a product of identifying major dialect groups with all corresponding regional groupings. Likewise, only the people of certain regions in southern Albania identify as Tosks. Etymology The etymology of the term Gheg is not completely clear. According to the writer Arshi Pipa , the term Gegë was initially used for confessional denotation, being used in pre-Ottoman Albania by its Orthodox population when referring to their Catholic neighbors. Territory Ethnographic regions of the Ghegs In Albania, Ghegs predominantly live north of the Shkumbin river and in areas of the mountainous north. (from the",

The council later participated in the Bangkok Conference, continuing its efforts to align overseas Indian activism with Congress leadership and resist appearing as Japanese collaborators.\n\n**Keywords**: Indian National Council, Bangkok 1941, Swami Satyananda Puri, F Kikan, Indian Independence League",
