AD 1781, when the British, under the command of the Traitor Benedict Arnold , burnt the towns of New London and Groton and spread desolation and woe throughout the region. Benedict Arnold (January 14, 1741 [ O.S. January 3, 1740] – June 14, 1801) was an American-born British military officer who served during the American Revolutionary War . He fought with distinction for the American Continental Army and rose to the rank of major general before defecting to the British in 1780. General George Washington had given him his fullest trust and had placed him in command of West Point in New York . Arnold was planning to surrender the fort to British forces, but the plot was discovered in September 1780, whereupon he fled to the British lines. In the later part of the war, Arnold was commissioned as a brigadier general in the British Army and placed in command of the American Legion . He led British forces in battle against the army which he had once commanded, and his name became synonymous with treason and betrayal in the United States. Born in Connecticut , Arnold was a merchant operating ships in the Atlantic when the war began. He joined the growing American army outside of Boston and distinguished himself by acts that demonstrated intelligence and bravery: In 1775, he captured Fort Ticonderoga . In 1776, he employed defensive and delaying tactics at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain that gave American forces time to prepare New York's defenses. His performance in the Battle of Ridgefield in Connecticut prompted his promotion to major general. He conducted operations that provided the Americans with relief during the Siege of Fort Stanwix , and key actions during the pivotal 1777 Battles of Saratoga in which he sustained leg injuries that put him out of combat for several years. Arnold repeatedly claimed that he was being passed over for promotion by the Second Continental Congress , and that other officers were being given credit for some of his accomplishments. Some in his military and political circles charged him with corruption . After formal inquiries, he was acquitted of all but two minor charges, but Congress investigated his finances and determined that he was indebted to Congress and that he had borrowed money heavily to maintain a lavish lifestyle. Arnold mingled with Loyalist sympathizers in Philadelphia and married into the Loyalist family of Peggy Shippen . She was a close friend of British Major John André and kept in contact with him when he became head of the British espionage system in New York. Many historians see her as having facilitated",

      "text": "The Siege of Yorktown , also known as the Battle of Yorktown and the surrender at Yorktown , was the final major land engagement of the American Revolutionary War . It was won decisively by the Continental Army , led by George Washington , with support from the Marquis de Lafayette and French Army troops , led by the Comte de Rochambeau , and a French Navy force commanded by the Comte de Grasse , defeating the British Army commanded by British Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis . The French and American armies united north of New York City during the summer of 1781. Following the arrival of dispatches from France that included the possibility of support from the French West Indies fleet of the Comte de Grasse , disagreements arose between Washington and Rochambeau on whether to ask de Grasse for assistance in besieging New York or in military operations against a British army in Virginia. On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay , where Cornwallis had taken command of the British army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer, Henry Clinton , was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep-water port, which he began to do at Yorktown. Cornwallis's movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette . When word of de Grasse's decision to engage the British navy at the Chesapeake Bay arrived in New York, the American and French armies began moving south toward Virginia , engaging in deception tactics to lead the British to believe a siege of New York was planned. De Grasse sailed from the West Indies and arrived at Chesapeake Bay at the end of August, bringing additional troops and creating a naval blockade of Yorktown. In the beginning of September, he defeated a British fleet led by Sir Thomas Graves , which was dispatched to relieve Cornwallis at the Battle of the Chesapeake . As a result of this victory, de Grasse blocked any reinforcement or escape by sea for Cornwallis and also disembarked the heavy siege guns required by the allied land forces. Washington and Rochambeau arrived at Yorktown on September 28, 1781. Washington moved the army closer to the British defenses on September 29. The American and French army and naval forces had completely surrounded Cornwallis. After initial preparations, the Americans and French built their first parallel and began the bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781, Washington sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column under Vicomte de Deux-Ponts took Redoubt No. 9 and an American column under Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses, the allies were able to finish their second parallel. With the Franco-American artillery closer and its bombardment more intense than ever, the British position began to deteriorate",

André carried six papers written by Arnold which were hidden in his stocking; they detailed to the British how to take the fort. In the event that André encountered American sentries, Arnold gave him a pass allowing him to travel under the name John Anderson. Arnold departed to return to his home, and Joshua Smith escorted André a few miles north, where the two men crossed to the east side of the Hudson River at King's Ferry. André, who had expected to travel to and from the meeting by ship while dressed in full uniform, was now traveling by road, in civilian disguise. He was deep behind American lines, and risked arrest as a spy. After spending the night in a local home, the two men continued on to the Croton River, the southernmost edge of the American lines. Here, Smith left him, and André continued south in hopes of coming into contact with one of the Loyalist groups who marauded through Westchester County, New York . (This area, known as the \" neutral ground ,\" was a no man's land between the positions of the American Revolutionary forces and the British forces. Both the army troops and the partisans of both sides patrolled the countryside.) He had been warned to keep inland, but André instead shifted west until he was riding down the Albany Post Road , which followed the edge of the Hudson. André rode on safely until 9 a.m. on September 23, when he arrived at the crossing of a stream known as Clark's Kill (since renamed Andre Brook) . Here, three Americans: John Paulding , Isaac Van Wart , and David Williams stopped him. They were part of a scouting party of the Westchester County Militia, commanded by Sgt. John Dean , that also included James Romer , John Yerkes, Isaac See, and Abraham Williams (David Williams's sixteen-year-old cousin). Paulding, Van Wirt, and Williams were assigned by Sgt. Dean to position themselves on the Albany Post Road and intercept Loyalist cattle raiders and other suspicious travelers. André believed that the trio were Loyalists because Paulding was wearing the uniform of a Hessian soldier . Paulding had himself escaped from a British prison only days earlier, aided by a sympathetic Loyalist who provided him with the uniform. \"Gentlemen,\" André said, \"I hope you belong to our party.\" \"What party?\" asked one of the trio. \"The lower party\", replied André, referring to the British, whose headquarters were to the south. \"We do\" was their answer. André then declared that he was a British officer who must not be detained. To his surprise, Paulding informed him that \"We are Americans\" and took him",

      "text": "Major John André (May 2, 1750 – October 2, 1780) was a British Army officer who served as the head of Britain's intelligence operations during the American War for Independence . In September 1780, André negotiated with Continental Army general Benedict Arnold , who secretly offered to turn over control of the American fort at West Point, New York to the British. Due to a series of mishaps and unforeseen events, André was forced to try to return to British lines from a meeting with Arnold through American-controlled territory while wearing civilian clothes. André was captured by three American militiamen and was quickly identified and imprisoned. He was subsequently convicted of espionage by the Continental Army and executed by hanging on George Washington 's orders. His execution led to an outburst of anti-American sentiment in Great Britain, and American painter John Trumbull was imprisoned as a result. André is typically remembered positively by historians, and several prominent leaders of the Patriot cause , including Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette , disagreed with the decision to execute him. Early life André was born on May 2, 1750, in London , England, to wealthy Huguenot parents who had immigrated there from Continental Europe . His parents were Antoine André, a merchant from Geneva , and Marie Louise Girardot, who had been born in Paris . André was educated at St Paul's School , Westminster School , and in Geneva; he was briefly engaged to Honora Sneyd . In 1771, at the age of 20, he joined the British Army , being commissioned into the 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welsh Fuzileers) at the rank of second lieutenant before quickly being promoted to lieutenant in the 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers) . André took a leave of absence in Germany for nearly two years, before re-joining his regiment in British North America in 1774. American War for Independence During the early days of the American War for Independence , before independence was declared by the Continental Congress , André was captured at Fort Saint-Jean by Continental Army troops under the command of General Richard Montgomery in November 1775, and held prisoner at Lancaster, Pennsylvania . He lived in the home of Caleb Cope, enjoying the freedom of the town, as André had given his word not to escape . In December 1776, he was freed in a prisoner exchange , and was promoted to the rank of captain in the 26th Regiment of Foot on January 18, 1777. In the same year, André was appointed as an aide-de-camp to Major-General Charles Grey , serving in the British expedition to capture Philadelphia and participating in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown . In September 1778, he accompanied Grey during Grey's raid , and was sent back to Sir Henry Clinton as a dispatch bearer. After Grey returned to England, André was appointed as an aide-de-camp to",

After the war, Jodl was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace , planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression , war crimes , and crimes against humanity at the Allied-organized Nuremberg trials . The principal charges against him related to his signing of the criminal Commando and Commissar Orders . Found guilty on all charges, he was sentenced to death and executed in Nuremberg in 1946. Early life and career Alfred Jodl (second from right) as a captain of the Reichswehr with his brother Ferdinand (second from left), 1926 Alfred Jodl was educated at a military cadet school in Munich , from which he graduated in 1910. Ferdinand Jodl , who also became an army general, was his younger brother. He was the nephew of philosopher and psychologist Friedrich Jodl at the University of Vienna . Jodl was raised Roman Catholic but rejected the faith later in life. From 1914 to 1916, he served with a field artillery regiment on the Western Front , being awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class for gallantry in November 1914, and for being wounded in action. In 1917, he served briefly on the Eastern Front before returning to the West as a staff officer. In 1918, he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class for gallantry in action. After the defeat of the German Empire in 1918, he continued his career as a professional soldier with the much-reduced German Army ( Reichswehr ).

      "text": "enemy, and that agreeable to the law and usage of nations , it is their opinion, he ought to suffer death.\" Sir Henry Clinton did all that he could to save André, his favourite aide-de-camp. However, in their written negotiations Washington demanded that in exchange for André, Clinton must give the Americans Arnold, who was then under British protection in New York. Clinton personally detested Arnold, but declined to hand him over to the Americans. From the time of his arrest, André endeared himself to the Americans, some of whom lamented his death sentence as much as the British. Alexander Hamilton in particular was thoroughly charmed by André, writing that \"He united a peculiar elegance of mind and manners, and the advantage of a pleasing person\". As his date of execution approached, André appealed to Washington to be executed by firing squad as a soldier, rather than hanged as was customary for spies: \"I trust that the request that I make to your Excellency at this serious period, and which is to soften my last moments, will not be rejected. Sympathy towards a soldier will surely induce your Excellency and a military tribunal to adapt the mode of my death to the feelings of a man of honor.\" Washington refused his request. André was hanged by the Continental Army as a spy in Tappan on October 2, 1780. According to witnesses, he placed the noose around his own neck and tightened it. The day before his hanging, André drew a likeness of himself with pen and ink, which is now owned by Yale College . A religious poem was found in his pocket after his execution, written two days beforehand. Lafayette was reported to have wept at the execution of André.  Alexander Hamilton wrote of him: \"Never perhaps did any man suffer death with more justice, or deserve it less.\" Eyewitness accounts An eyewitness account of André's last day can be found in the book The American Revolution: From the Commencement to the Disbanding of the American Army Given in the Form of a Daily Journal, with the Exact Dates of all the Important Events : October 2nd. – Major André is no more among the living. I have just witnessed his exit. It was a tragical scene of the deepest interest. During his confinement and trial, he exhibited those proud and elevated sensibilities which designate greatness and dignity of mind. Not a murmur or a sigh ever escaped him, and the civilities and attentions bestowed on him were politely acknowledged. Having left a mother and two sisters in England, he was heard to mention them in terms of the tenderest affection, and in his letter to Sir Henry Clinton, he recommended them to his particular attention. The principal guard officer, who was constantly in the room with the prisoner, relates that when the hour of execution was announced to him in the morning, he received it without emotion, and while all present were affected with silent gloom, he retained a firm",

The rope being appended to the gallows, he slipped the noose over his head and adjusted it to his neck, without the assistance of the awkward executioner. Colonel Scammel now informed him that he had an opportunity to speak, if he desired it; he raised the handkerchief from his eyes, and said, \"I pray you to bear me witness that I meet my fate like a brave man.\" The wagon being now removed from under him, he was suspended, and instantly expired; it proved indeed \"but a momentary pang.\" He was dressed in his royal regimentals and boots, and his remains, in the same dress, were placed in an ordinary coffin, and interred at the foot of the gallows; and the spot was consecrated by the tears of thousands... Legacy A memorial to André in Westminster Abbey On the day of his capture, James Rivington published André's poem \"The Cow Chace\" in his gazette in New York. In the poem, André muses on the American defeat at the Battle of Bull's Ferry . Nathan Strickland, André's executioner, who was detained at the Continental Army camp in Tappan during André's trial due to being a Loyalist, was granted freedom for accepting the duty of hangman and returned to his home in the Ramapo Valley or Smith's Cove; nothing further of him is known. Joshua Smith, whose connections to André were discovered, was also brought to trial at the Reformed Church of Tappan . The trial lasted four weeks and ended in Smith being acquitted due to a lack of evidence. The Colquhon brothers, as well as a Continental Army major named Keirs, under whose supervision the boat was obtained, were exonerated from all suspicion.  After news of André's execution reached Great Britain , there was an outburst of anti-Americanism and American painter John Trumbull was arrested for treason , since he was known to be a former Continental Army officer of a similar rank to André. He was released after seven months of imprisonment. A pension was awarded by the British to André's mother and three sisters not long after his death; and his brother William André was made a baronet in his honor in 1781 (see André baronets ). In 1804 a memorial plaque by Charles Regnart was erected",

With the arrival of Cornwallis and more reinforcements from New York, the British Army numbered 7,200 men. Cornwallis wanted to push Lafayette, whose force now numbered 3,000 men with the arrival of Virginia militia. On May 24, he set out after Lafayette, who withdrew from Richmond, and linked forces with those under the command of Baron von Steuben and Anthony Wayne . Cornwallis did not pursue Lafayette. Instead, he sent raiders into central Virginia, where they attacked depots and supply convoys, before being recalled on June 20. Cornwallis then headed for Williamsburg, and Lafayette's force of now 4,500 followed him. General Clinton, in a confusing series of orders, ordered Cornwallis first to Portsmouth and then Yorktown, where he was instructed to build fortifications for a deep water port. An expedition of 5,500 French troops under Comte de Rochambeau arrived in Newport, Rhode Island, by sea on July 10, 1780. On July 6, 1781, the French and American armies met at White Plains , north of New York City. Although Rochambeau had almost 40 years of warfare experience, he never challenged Washington's authority, telling Washington he had come to serve, not to command. Washington and Rochambeau discussed where to launch a joint attack. Washington believed an attack on New York was the best option, since the Americans and French now outnumbered the British defenders 3 to 1. Rochambeau disagreed, arguing the fleet in the West Indies under Admiral de Grasse was going to sail to the American coast, where easier options than attacking New York could be attempted. In early July, Washington suggested an attack be made at the northern part of Manhattan Island , but his officers and Rochambeau all disagreed. Washington continued to probe the New York area until August 14, when he received a letter from de Grasse stating he was headed for Virginia with 28 warships and 3,200 soldiers, but could only remain there until October 14. De Grasse encouraged Washington to move south so they could launch a joint operation. Washington abandoned his plan to take New York, and began to prepare his army for the march south to Virginia. March to Yorktown On August 19, using what is now known as the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route , Washington and Rochambeau began what was called the \"celebrated march\" to Yorktown. 7,000 soldiers (4,000 French and 3,000 American) began the march in Newport, Rhode Island , while the rest remained behind to protect the Hudson Valley . Washington wanted to maintain complete secrecy of their destination. To ensure this, he sent out fake dispatches that reached Clinton revealing that the Franco-American army was going to launch an attack on New York City,",

Over ten days of trenching and bombardment, allied artillery progressively silenced British guns; night assaults on 14 October carried redoubts 9 and 10, enabling the final parallel. Outnumbered and without relief, Cornwallis surrendered 7,000 troops on 19 October 1781, paving the way for the 1783 Treaty of Paris and American independence.  \n\n**Keywords**:  \nYorktown siege, Cornwallis surrender, Franco-American alliance, Washington-Rochambeau, Revolutionary War finale",

Initially composed of five congressional delegates, it compiled officer rosters, tracked troops and supplies, and handled prisoner-of-war affairs. Overwhelmed by workload, the board was reconstituted in October 1777 as a five-member body of non-congressional commissioners led by Horatio Gates, with expanded duties including recruitment supervision and weapons production. Further reforms in 1778–79 placed quartermaster and commissary departments under its control, cementing its role as Congress’s sole military intermediary.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nContinental Army administration, Second Continental Congress, Horatio Gates, military logistics, American Revolution",

Japanese massacres, American artillery bombardment, and house-to-house fighting obliterated the city’s Spanish-colonial and early-American architectural heritage, with only two buildings in the business district surviving intact. After the Japanese garrison ignored orders to withdraw, U.S. troops systematically reduced strongholds such as Intramuros, Rizal Stadium, and Fort San Antonio Abad, counting 16,665 Japanese dead inside the Walled City alone. The battle’s aftermath saw General Yamashita executed for war crimes and Manila’s transformation from the “Pearl of the Orient” to a modernist American-style capital.

Over 400 mostly non-Afghan Taliban fighters, inadequately searched after surrendering, seized the fort’s armory and mounted a fierce, well-coordinated uprising against Northern Alliance guards and two CIA interrogators, killing officer Johnny Micheal Spann—the first U.S. combat death of the war. Northern Alliance troops, reinforced by British and U.S. special-operations teams, responded with armor, close-air support, and ultimately flooded the basement where hold-outs had barricaded themselves. By 1 December only 86 of the original 400+ prisoners survived; among them was American John Walker Lindh. The engagement became one of the bloodiest episodes of the early Afghan conflict and highlighted the risks of handling large numbers of unscreened foreign fighters.\n\n**Keywords**: Qala-i-Jangi, prisoner uprising, Johnny Micheal Spann, John Walker Lindh, 2001 Afghanistan war",
