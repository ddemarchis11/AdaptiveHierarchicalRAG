      "text": "Mitsubishi Motors Corporation ( 三菱自動車工業株式会社 , Mitsubishi Jidōsha Kōgyō KK ; lit. ' Three Diamonds Automotive Industry Company ' , / m ɪ t s ʊ ˈ b iː ʃ i / , Japanese pronunciation: [mitsɯꜜbiɕi] ) is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Minato, Tokyo , Japan. In 2011, Mitsubishi Motors was the sixth-largest Japanese automaker and the 19th-largest worldwide by production. Since October 2016, Mitsubishi has been one-third (34%) owned by Nissan , and included in the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance . Besides being part of the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, it is also a part of Mitsubishi keiretsu , formerly the biggest industrial group in Japan. The company was originally formed in 1970 from the automotive division of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries . Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation , which builds commercial-grade trucks, buses, and heavy construction equipment, was formerly a part of Mitsubishi Motors, but is now owned by German automotive corporation Daimler Truck , with Mitsubishi continuing to own a small stake. History Workers at Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd, alongside one of the prototype Mitsubishi Model A automobiles (1917) Mitsubishi's automotive origins date back to 1917, when the Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., introduced the Mitsubishi Model A , Japan's first series-production automobile. An entirely hand-built seven-seater sedan based on the FIAT Tipo 3 , it proved expensive compared to its American and European mass-produced rivals, and was discontinued in 1921 after only 22 had been built. In 1934, Mitsubishi Shipbuilding was merged with the Mitsubishi Aircraft Co., a company established in 1920 to manufacture aircraft engines and other parts. The unified company was known as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), and was the largest private company in Japan. MHI concentrated on manufacturing aircraft , ships , railroad cars and machinery, but in 1937 developed the PX33 , a prototype sedan for military use. It was the first Japanese-built passenger car with full-time four-wheel drive , a technology the company would return to almost 50 years later in its quest for motorsport and sales success. A 1937 Mitsubishi PX33 on display at the Mondial de l'Automobile in September 2006 Post-World War history Logo of Mitsubishi Motors from 1983 to 2017 Immediately following the end of the Second World War , the company returned to manufacturing vehicles. Fuso bus production resumed, while a small three-wheeled cargo vehicle called the Mizushima and a scooter called the Silver Pigeon were also developed. However, the zaibatsu (Japan's family-controlled industrial conglomerates) were ordered to be dismantled by the Allied powers in 1950,",

From 2010, they were superseded with Mitsubishi's self-developed 4N1 diesel engines. 2006–2024: Chinese joint ventures As of 2006, Mitsubishi had four joint ventures with Chinese partners: South East (Fujian) Motor Co Ltd Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing Co Ltd Harbin Dongan Automotive Engine Manufacturing Co Ltd – a subsidiary of Harbin Hafei Automobile Industry Group Co Ltd Hunan Changfeng Motor Co Ltd – a subsidiary of Chang Feng (Group) Co Ltd 2010–present: Nissan, Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi In December 2010, Mitsubishi and Nissan agreed to form a joint venture (later named \" NMKV Co., Ltd.\") to develop kei cars for the Japanese market. In 2016, Nissan uncovered evidence that Mitsubishi's fuel-economy testing numbers were erroneous and had been erroneous since the start of the venture, affecting 625,000 cars produced by NMKV. The result of the \"fuel economy scandal\" was that Nissan acquired a controlling interest in Mitsubishi. 2024–present: Nissan and Honda alliance In July 2024, Mitsubishi Motors and Nissan announced a partnership with Honda for the joint development of their future electric models. On 23 December 2024, Honda officially announced an MOU had been entered to merge with Japanese car company Nissan to become the 3rd largest auto company by sales. Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan has 24% ownership, also agreed to join the talks of integration. In mid February 2025, Nissan, Honda, and Mitsubishi ended talks due to the talks shifting to Nissan becoming a subsidiary of Honda, which Nissan refused as it wouldn't have allowed the potential of Nissan to be realized. Despite this, Nissan, Honda, and Mitsubishi will continue forward with the partnership formed in July 2024. Japan sales channels A Mitsubishi Motors dealer in Akita Mitsubishi Motors maintained two retail sales channels that sold specific models, called \"Car Plaza\" and \"Galant Shop\". Certain models were exclusive to either channel, while some models were available at both channels, as required by local Japanese market conditions. More recently, [ when? ] due to cancellation of larger sedans, the sales channels have been combined into one franchise that sells all models, including kei cars and commercial delivery vehicles.  Historical troubles Asian economic downturn The benefits Mitsubishi Motors had seen because of its strong presence in Southeast Asia reversed themselves as a result of the economic crisis in the region , which began in 1991 with the advent of the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble , referred to in Japan as the beginning of the Lost Decade and continued to 1997. The collapse was partly the result of the Plaza Accord agreement in 1985, which sought to equalize the United States dollar with the Japanese yen",

      "text": "Alliance logo The Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance , originally known as the Renault–Nissan Alliance , is a French-Japanese strategic alliance between the automobile manufacturers Renault (based in Boulogne-Billancourt , Île-de-France , France), Nissan (based in Yokohama, Kanagawa , Japan) and Mitsubishi Motors (based in Minato, Tokyo , Japan), which together sell more than one in nine vehicles worldwide. Renault and Nissan have been strategic partners since 1999, have nearly 450,000 employees, and control eight major brands: Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Infiniti , Renault Korea , Dacia , Alpine , and Venucia . The car group sold 10.6 million vehicles worldwide in 2017, making it the leading light vehicle manufacturing group in the world. The Alliance adopted its current name in September 2017, one year after Nissan acquired a controlling interest in Mitsubishi and subsequently made Mitsubishi an equal partner in the Alliance. As of December 2021 [update] , the Alliance is one of the world's leading electric vehicle manufacturing groups, with global sales of over 1 million light-duty electric vehicles since 2009. The top selling vehicles of its EV line-up are the Nissan Leaf and the Renault Zoe all-electric cars . The strategic partnership between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi is not a merger or an acquisition. The three companies are joined through a cross-sharing agreement. The structure was unique in the auto industry during the 1990s consolidation trend and later served as a model for General Motors and the PSA Group , as well as the Volkswagen Group and Suzuki , though many of these capital alliances failed or only lasted for a few years. The Alliance itself has broadened its scope substantially, forming additional partnerships with automakers including Germany's Daimler and China's Dongfeng . Following the November 2018 arrest and imprisonment of Alliance chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn , accompanied by his dismissal from the alliance and its components, press analysts have questioned both the stability of the Alliance's shareholding agreement and its long-term existence. These analysts also note that, because the companies' recent business strategies are interdependent, attempts to restructure the Alliance could be counter-productive for all of the members. In January 2023, Renault and Nissan moved to restructure their alliance in order to recover from Ghosn's arrest and manage through a post-Covid economy. The primary objective was to give both companies more autonomy. Corporate structure and strategy The Alliance is a strategic partnership based on the rationale that, due to substantial cross-shareholding investments, each company acts in the financial interest of the other—while maintaining individual brand identities and independent corporate cultures. For many years, Renault had a 43.4% voting stake in Nissan and Nissan held a 15% non-voting stake in Renault, effectively giving Renault control. In 2023, Renault reduced its 43.3% voting",

The facility was known as Diamond-Star Motors, and was initially a joint venture with Chrysler, but Chrysler sold its stake in the plant to Mitsubishi in 1993. After 1995, the facility was known as Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA). At its peak in 2000, the facility produced over 222,000 vehicles per year, but following the decline of Mitsubishi Motors in North America, the plant operated well below capacity for years. In July 2015, Mitsubishi Motors announced that it would close the plant by November, but would continue to sell automobiles in North America. In 2014, the plant had produced just 69,000 vehicles, roughly one-quarter of its capacity. Production at the plant ended on 30 November 2015, and most of the employees were laid off. The plant continued to operate with a minimal staff to produce replacement parts until May 2016, after which it closed permanently. Withdrawal from UK market Mitsubishi Motors announced that the company would leave the UK market due to financial reasons by autumn 2021. Since then, Mitsubishi's British presence is limited to aftersales service. Withdrawal from Chinese market Mitsubishi Motors announced its withdrawal from its joint venture GAC Mitsubishi in the Chinese market in October 2023. As part of this exit, GAC Group will take over GAC Mitsubishi's plant in Changsha to produce GAC Aion electric vehicles. This did not affect the Shenyang Aerospace-Mitsubishi Motors engine manufacturing joint venture, which continued production to supply engines to local Chinese automakers and provide aftersales service for Mitsubishi vehicles. After being established in 1997 and beginning production in 1998 to produce engines for Mitsubishi vehicles and to prominently supply at the time fledgling local Chinese automakers, Mitsubishi announced that it was exiting the Shenyang Aerospace-Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing joint venture on 22 July 2025. Mitsubishi stated that it made the decision due to the Chinese auto industry's rapid shift to electric vehicle, and it marks the complete exit of the company from the Chinese market. Fuel economy scandal In early 2016, Mitsubishi Motors partner Nissan found discrepancies between Mitsubishi information and actual fuel consumption while working in new micro (kei) cars for both companies, the eK Wagon, eK Space, Nissan Dayz, and Nissan Dayz Roox. At the time, Mitsubishi Motors manufactured micro cars for Nissan, which had never produced that class of vehicle itself. Mitsubishi Motors admitted that they had been giving incorrect information on fuel consumption from 2002 onwards, using inaccurate test methods. Later, the company said it used fuel-economy testing methods that did not comply with Japanese regulations for 25 years, much longer than previously known. Mitsubishi Motors management said they were unaware about the issue and that the incorrect information came from the micro car development department, NMKV . They ordered an investigation led by investigators",

Eastern Airways and Flybe franchise An Eastern BAe Jetstream 41 , operated for Flybe It was announced on 21 September 2017 that Eastern Airways would enter a franchise with Flybe, starting on 29 October 2017. The franchise saw all scheduled flights operated by Eastern Airways carry BE (Flybe) flight numbers. Following Loganair's decision to end its partnership with Flybe, to remain on multiple markets flyBe announced a significant expansion onto routes also operated by Loganair using Eastern Airways to operate the services, largely targeting the Scottish Highlands , including introduction jet service into Sumburgh for the first time as part of the operating plan flyBe contracted Eastern Airways to provide. The last of these new routes was dropped by the end of 2018, citing a lack of demand for two competing airlines given capacity had doubled on many with a static market size. 2020s On 5 March 2020, Flybe entered administration and ceased operations, resulting in Eastern Airways resuming flying under its own brand. Seeking to take advantage of Flybe's demise, the airline announced the opening of a base at Southampton , where Flybe had operated 95% of the airport's flights, with new routes to Manchester and Newcastle, eventually being joined by Belfast City and Dublin , along with pre-existing service to Aberdeen, Leeds Bradford and Teesside . The routes from Manchester were subsequently cancelled. In May 2021, Eastern commenced flying to Gibraltar for the first time, with services from both Birmingham and Southampton airports, however cancelled both routes a year later as international travel remained in slow recovery post Covid-19. The airline also commenced service between Cardiff and Belfast City, seeking to fill another gap left by Flybe's collapse, but suspended the route in early 2022 after the Welsh Government decided to permanently cancel the PSO service between Cardiff and Anglesey suspended during Covid-19, thus rendering the airline's Cardiff base unviable as a single route operation. PSO contracts Eastern Airways had previously operated the Welsh Government PSO service between Cardiff Airport and Anglesey Airport from 2015 until the government removed funding for the service in 2022 and did not reopen the north–south connection to the capital post Covid-19. In December 2021, Eastern Airways was awarded the PSO contract to operate a service between Newquay and London Gatwick which between 2021 and 2024 saw the growth of passenger volumes back to over 85,000 annually between Cornwall and London. Additionally in April 2022 Eastern Airways were awarded another PSO contract in Scotland to operate services between Aberdeen and Wick .

It is believed to be the first or one of the first Japanese films to be screened in Europe, and often mentioned in conjunction with Kinugasa's other avant-garde film , the two years earlier A Page of Madness . Plot A young man is obsessed with courtesan O-ume, but she refuses to meet him anymore, finding him too persistent. During a fight, the young man seemingly kills his rival, and is himself blinded. He hides in the flat which he shares with his sister, not knowing that the rival's death was only staged. A man approaches the sister, pretending to be a policeman who can help her to clear her brother from the charges with money. Also, a doctor whom the sister consults declares that her brother's eyes can be cured, but only if she can pay him. To collect the money, she offers herself as a prostitute to a procuress. When the alleged policeman attempts to rape the sister, she stabs him. Meanwhile, the brother has regained his eyesight on his own, goes to O-umes house and dies under her window, foaming from the mouth and ridiculed by O-ume and his rival. The last scene shows the sister standing at a crossway, calling in vain for her brother. Cast Akiko Chihaya as the sister Junosuke Bando as the brother Yukiko Ogawa as O-ume, the courtesan Minoru Takase as the policeman (as Ippei Sōma) Misao Seki as the landlord Yoshie Nakagawa as the procuress Teruko Nijō as the wrong woman Keinosuke Sawada as the rival (as Myoichiro Ozawa) Release history Crossroads was released in Japan on 11 May 1928. It was first screened in London on 26 January 1930 as Crossways and shown in New York in July of the same year as Slums of Tokyo . While favourably received by critics in Berlin and Paris, the New York Times critic stated, the film \"possesses the virtue of sincerity but its tempo is too heavy\". In later years, film historians repeatedly commented on the influence of the German expressionist film on Crossroads , in particular the works of Fritz Lang . Legacy Crossroads was screened at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive in 1983, at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2000, at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival in 2008 and at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2014. It was included in the British Film Institute 's \"The best Japanese film of every year – from 1925 to now\" list. References External links Crossroads at IMDb Crossroads is available for free",

The airline operated domestic, international and private charter flights. Around 1,300,000 passengers flew with the airline per rolling year including on services for KLM Cityhopper, charter operations, and government subsidised public service obligation (PSO) services which would otherwise be commercially unfeasible. The airline had its own hubs in Aberdeen and Humberside . Air Kilroe held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence. It was permitted to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats and was IOSA approved. History Early years Co-founded by Bryan Huxford and Richard Lake, the airline started operations in December 1997 with a scheduled route between Humberside and Aberdeen with a leased Swearingen Metro , following KLM UK's withdrawal from the route. In February 1999, it purchased Manchester based Air Kilroe , thereby acquiring an air operator's certificate and a fleet of two BAe Jetstream 32 aircraft. In 2002, the first BAe Jetstream 41 entered the Eastern fleet, the aircraft type which formed the majority of the fleet up until the airline ceased operations. 12 aircraft and their associated routes were transferred from British Airways CitiExpress on 30 March 2003. An Embraer 145 and 135 were also wet-leased from City Airline in 2003, which were then replaced with Saab 2000 aircraft, which peaked at 8 being operated by 2013 including acquisitions from Crossair and other European carriers. In 2006, Eastern Airways wet-leased a Dornier 328 from Cirrus Airlines for six months to operate a Newcastle to London City service before switching this onto the BAe Jetstream 41. Eastern Airways also purchased a Jetstream 41 training simulator . As part of One NorthEast 's \"Passionate People Passionate Places\" campaign for North East England , Eastern Airways had a Jetstream 41 painted in promotional colours. It also featured in the 2007 Sunderland International Airshow . A Saab 2000 was also painted in a promotional 'Aberdeen City and Shire' colour scheme. The airline shut down its hub at the Isle of Man in August 2009, discontinuing routes to Birmingham and Newcastle from the airport. 2010s In July 2010, the airline took delivery of an Embraer 135 with 37 seats and signed a lease on a second, thus adding jet aircraft to their fleet for the first time since the acquisition to replace their previously operated Embraer ERJ aircraft. They were to be used mainly on charter services to central and Eastern Europe; however, they also offered increased flexibility on the airline's scheduled flights. In July 2010, the airline named one of their BAe Jetstream 41 aircraft",
