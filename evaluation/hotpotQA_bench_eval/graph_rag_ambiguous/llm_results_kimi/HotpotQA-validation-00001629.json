      "text": "Jacques Feyder ( French: [fɛ.dɛʁ] ; 21 July 1885 – 24 May 1948) was a Belgian film director, screenwriter and actor who worked principally in France, but also in the US, Britain and Germany. He was a director of silent films during the 1920s, and in the 1930s he became associated with the style of poetic realism in French cinema . He adopted French nationality in 1928. Career Born Jacques Léon Louis Frédérix in Ixelles , Belgium, he was educated at the École régimentaire in Nivelles, and was destined for a military career. At age twenty-five however he moved to Paris where he pursued an interest in acting, first on stage and then in film, adopting the name Jacques Feyder . He joined the Gaumont Film Company and in 1914 he became an assistant director with Gaston Ravel . He started directing films for Gaumont in 1916, but his career was interrupted by service with the Belgian Army from 1917 to 1919 during World War I . Henry Roussel and Albert Préjean (right) in Les Nouveaux Messieurs (1929) After the end of the war, he returned to filmmaking and quickly built a reputation as one of the most innovative directors in French cinema. L'Atlantide (1921) (based on the novel by Pierre Benoit ), and Crainquebille (1922) (from the novel by Anatole France ) were his first major films to achieve public and critical attention. He followed these with Visages d'enfants (filmed in 1923 but not released until 1925) which proved to be one of his most personal and enduring films. Shortly after this, Feyder was offered a post as artistic director of a new film company, Vita Films, in Vienna, along with a contract to make three films. He made Das Bildnis ( L'Image ) (1923), but the company failed and he returned to Paris. He re-established himself with Gribiche (1926) and the literary adaptations of Carmen (1926) and Thérèse Raquin (1928). He also contributed screenplays of films for other directors, notably Poil de carotte (1925) for Julien Duvivier , and Gardiens de phare (1929) for Jean Grémillon . His last silent film in France was Les Nouveaux Messieurs , a topical political satire which provoked calls for it to be banned in France for \"insulting the dignity of parliament and its ministers\". By this time Feyder had accepted an offer from MGM to work in Hollywood, where in 1929 his first project was directing Greta Garbo in The Kiss , her last silent film. It was in Hollywood that he made the transition to sound films;",

His films explored recurring themes such as unattainable love, the tension between perception and reality, and maternal devotion, often realized through meticulous visual composition and strong collaborations with actors and designers like Lazare Meerson. After early success in France, Feyder worked in Hollywood, Germany, and Britain, adapting to sound cinema and directing multilingual versions of films. His mid-1930s French works, especially *Le Grand Jeu*, *Pension Mimosas*, and *La Kermesse héroïque*, helped define poetic realism and influenced future filmmakers like Marcel Carné.
