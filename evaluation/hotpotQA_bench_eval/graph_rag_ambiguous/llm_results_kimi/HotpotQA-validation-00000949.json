      "text": "Tatton Hall and the Italian Garden Tatton Park is a historic estate in Cheshire , England, north of the town of Knutsford . It contains a mansion, Tatton Hall ; a medieval manor house , Tatton Old Hall ; Tatton Park Gardens , a farm and a deer park of 2,000 acres (8.1 km 2 ). It is a popular visitor attraction and hosts over a hundred events annually. The estate is owned by the National Trust and is managed under lease by Cheshire East Council . Since 1999, it has hosted North West England 's annual Royal Horticultural Society flower show. History Village There is evidence of human habitation in the area of the estate going back to the Iron Age . The village of Tatton existed in medieval times. The settlement is now a Deserted medieval village but its buildings and roadways – which are now a scheduled monument – can still be seen as imprints within the estate's parkland. Old Hall By the end of the 15th century, the land on which the estate was created was owned by the Stanley family who built and occupied what became known as the Old Hall. By the 1580s this building had been enlarged and it was owned by the Brereton family. In 1598 the estate was bought by Sir Thomas Egerton , Lord Chancellor of England, from his half sister Dorothy Brereton. Sir Thomas and his children rarely visited the estate and it was rented to tenants. The hall was originally timber-framed , which was subsequently replaced by brick. It is L-shaped, in two storeys. The floors that had been inserted into the older wing have been removed, revealing the complex wooden roof. The Old Hall stands in grounds surrounded by a wall. Within these grounds is a reconstructed cruck barn. It is timber-framed with brick infill and has a thatched roof. Most of the timber has come from a demolished barn at Clotton Hoofield . The barn has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building . Tatton Hall At the end of the 17th century the estate was owned by John Egerton, Sir Thomas' grandson, who built a new house on the site of the present mansion, some 0.75 miles (1 km) to the west of the Old Hall. Work was completed around 1716. From 1758 improvements were made to the house and between the 1770s and 1816 most of it was replaced by the present neoclassical mansion, designed by Samuel Wyatt and his nephew Lewis William Wyatt . Further additions to the house were made in 1861–62 and in 1884. During the late 19th century large house parties were held in the hall, some of them attended by British and foreign royalty. The mansion contains much of the furniture made for its occupants by the family firm Gillows of Lancaster . There are over 150 provenanced or",

At the southwest extremity of the gardens is the Arboretum which contains 880 plants of 281 species. Between the Arboretum and the south end of the Broad Walk lies the Japanese Garden which was constructed in the 1910s. This contains structures such as a Shinto shrine, a tea house and a bridge over the Golden Brook. The plants, rocks and stones in the garden are arranged to give a natural balance and a mound has been built to resemble Mount Fuji . The garden had become overgrown and it was restored to its former state in the early 2000s. Parkland The Knutsford Lodge A winter sunset at Tatton Park Tatton Mere Tatton Park looking northwest with the wartime parachutist landing area in the centre of the image The parkland consists of 2,000 acres (8.1 km 2 ) of landscaped deer park , 1,000 acres (4.0 km 2 ) of which are open to the public. Much of the design of the park was inspired by the ideas of Humphrey Repton . In the park are two meres; the larger, Tatton Mere, is natural but the other, Melchett Mere, is the consequence of subsidence in the 1920s. The meres are Sites of Special Scientific Interest and Ramsar sites. The deer park was created by a royal charter in 1290 and deer have been present since then. The two species present are red deer and fallow deer of which there are 400 breeding stock. Two rare species of sheep graze in the park, Hebridean sheep and Soay sheep . Visitor activities pursued in the park include walking, cycling (cycles are available to hire), horse riding, sailing and fishing. Near the main car park is a children's adventure playground. The parkland is listed as Grade II* in the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England . Around the park are three lodges. To the south leading to Knutsford is Knutsford Lodge. This dates from 1810 and was designed by Lewis Wyatt. It consists of a triple gateway constructed of ashlar stone with a large central arch and smaller flanking arches, each with cast-iron gates, and a single-storey lodge to the west. The lodge is also constructed of ashlar with a slate roof. Flanking the central arch are Doric columns carrying an entablature with a triglyph frieze , and a pediment surmounted by heavy acroteria .

The mansion contains much of the furniture made for its occupants by the family firm Gillows of Lancaster . There are over 150 provenanced or marked Gillow examples. Also in the hall is a large collection of paintings, many of them being portraits of the Egerton family, and in addition paintings by Canaletto , Poussin , Chardin , Van Dyck , Vasari , and many others. The Library contains first editions of two novels by Jane Austen . One room is dedicated to a collection of items from around the world assembled by the last owner of the house, Maurice Egerton , the last Lord Egerton . In the family wing are the servants' quarters. These include rooms containing much of the equipment and many of the utensils used to serve the family. The hall is a member of the Historic Houses Association . This mansion, Tatton Hall, was extensively altered and extended between 1780 and 1813. In 1795 the estate covered 251,000 acres (1,020 km 2 ) (392 sq.miles). Agriculture Home Farm To the north of the mansion is Home Farm, which provided food and building services for the estate. It has been maintained to look much as it did in the 1930s when electricity replaced steam to operate the farm machinery. It is now open as a visitor attraction and contains a variety of farm animals. The farm takes an interest in caring for and breeding rare breeds of farm animals, including Tamworth pigs , Red Poll cows and Leicester Longwool sheep. In 2007 the farm received accreditation by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust .

On 6 July 1940, Squadron Leader Louis Strange approached his pre-World War I fellow aviator and friend Maurice Egerton to ask for his co-operation in granting permission for the Royal Air Force to use his estate for this most important wartime purpose. Lord Egerton readily agreed to the proposal and the first live test jumps from aircraft were made on 13 July by RAF parachuting instructors. Between 1940 and early 1946, approximately 60,000 trainees from the United Kingdom and several European countries, including Special agents made their first training drops from cages suspended from Barrage balloons over an open area to the northwest of the hall. After their initial drops from the balloons, the trainees then boarded aircraft at Ringway for the short flight to overhead Tatton Park, where they jumped in batches of ten, and later twenty, from approximately 800",

The Young Person's Guide , based on a theme by Purcell, showcases the orchestra's individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset. Christopher Headington calls the work \"exuberant and uncomplicated music, scored with clarity and vigour [that] fits well into Britten's oeuvre .\" David Matthews calls it \"a brilliant educational exercise.\" Unlike his English predecessors such as Elgar and Vaughan Williams, and composers from mainland Europe whom he admired, including Mahler and Shostakovich, Britten was not a classical symphonist. His youthful jeux d'esprit the Simple Symphony (1934) is in conventional symphonic structure, observing sonata form and the traditional four-movement pattern, but of his mature works his Spring Symphony (1949) is more a song cycle than a true symphony, and the concertante Cello Symphony (1963) is an attempt to balance the traditional concerto and symphony. During its four movements the Cello Symphony moves from a deeply pessimistic opening to a finale of radiant happiness rare for Britten by this point. The composer considered it \"the finest thing I've written.\" The Piano Concerto (1938) was at first criticised for being too light-hearted and virtuoso. In 1945 Britten revised it, replacing a skittish third movement with a more sombre passacaglia that, in Matthews's view, gives the work more depth, and makes the apparent triumph of the finale more ambivalent. The Violin Concerto (1939), finished in the first weeks of the World War, has virtuoso elements, but they are balanced by lyrical and elegiac passages, \"undoubtedly reflecting Britten's growing concern with the escalation of world hostilities.\" Neither concerto is among Britten's most popular works, but in the 21st century the Violin Concerto, which is technically difficult, has been performed more frequently than before, both in the concert hall and on record, and has enthusiastic performers and advocates, notably violinist Janine Jansen . Britten's incidental music for theatre, film and radio, much of it unpublished, was the subject of an essay by William Mann , published in 1952 in the first detailed critical assessment of Britten's music to that date. Of these pieces the music for a radio play, The Rescue , by Edward Sackville-West , is praised by the musicologist Lewis Foreman as \"of such stature and individual character as to be worth a regular place alongside [Britten's] other dramatic scores.\" Mann finds in this score pre-echoes of the second act of Billy Budd , while Foreman observes that Britten \"appears to have made passing allusions to The Rescue in his final opera, Death in Venice .

      "text": "Britten in 1968, by Hans Wild Edward Benjamin Britten, Baron Britten OM CH (22 November 1913 – 4 December 1976) was an English composer, conductor, and pianist. He was a central figure of 20th-century British music, with a range of works including opera, other vocal music, orchestral and chamber pieces. His best-known works include the opera Peter Grimes (1945), the War Requiem (1962) and the orchestral showpiece The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). Britten was born in Lowestoft , Suffolk , the son of a dentist. He showed talent from an early age. He studied at the Royal College of Music in London and privately with the composer Frank Bridge . Britten first came to public attention with the a cappella choral work A Boy Was Born in 1934. With the premiere of Peter Grimes in 1945, he leapt to international fame. Over the next 28 years, he wrote 14 more operas, establishing himself as one of the leading 20th-century composers in the genre. In addition to large-scale operas for Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden , he wrote chamber operas for small forces, suitable for performance in venues of modest size. Among the best known of these is The Turn of the Screw (1954). Recurring themes in his operas include the struggle of an outsider against a hostile society and the corruption of innocence. Britten's other works range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and instrumental as well as film music. He took a great interest in writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera Noye's Fludde , a Missa Brevis , and the song collection Friday Afternoons . He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the tenor Peter Pears ; others included Kathleen Ferrier , Jennifer Vyvyan , Janet Baker , Dennis Brain , Julian Bream , Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau , Osian Ellis and Mstislav Rostropovich . Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as Bach 's Brandenburg Concertos , Mozart symphonies, and song cycles by Schubert and Schumann . Together with Pears and the librettist and producer Eric Crozier , Britten founded the annual Aldeburgh Festival in 1948, and he was responsible for the creation of Snape Maltings concert hall in 1967. In 1976, he was the first composer to be given a life peerage . He died shortly afterwards, aged 63.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a primary commercial service facility. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 148,584 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 138,957 in 2009 and 144,365 in 2010. In 2024, 610,641 passengers boarded flights at IDA, which was an 11.9% increase from 2023. This was also a 73.2% increase from 2019. Facilities Idaho Falls Regional Airport covers 866 acres (350 ha ) at an elevation of 4,744 feet (1,446 m). It has two asphalt runways: 3/21 is 9,002 by 150 feet (2,744 x 46 m) and 17/35 is 3,964 by 75 feet (1,208 x 23 m). In the year ending December 31, 2016, the airport had 33,152 aircraft operations, average 91 per day: 65% general aviation , 31% air taxi , 3% airline and <1% military. 171 aircraft were then based at this airport: 128 single-engine, 29 multi-engine, 6 jet, 5 helicopter , and 3 glider. History A historic portion on the east side of the airport was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The listing included two contributing buildings and a contributing structure on 4 acres (1.6 ha): an aircraft hangar , an administrator or caretaker's cabin, and a beacon tower, as well as a surrounding landscaped area. It \"represents\" the original site of operations for the Idaho Falls Airport. The hangar was still in use in 1996. Terminal The airport terminal has seen many expansions and a partial re-build throughout the years. The current terminal was built in 1959. The first expansion happening in 1982, which consisted of the old boarding area being torn down and retrofitted with jetways to accommodate smaller commercial aircraft that started coming in the mid-2000s. The previous terminal was designed with jetways for older generation Boeing 737, which stopped arriving in Idaho Falls after Delta Air Lines pulled out of mainline service to the airport in 1998. In 2014, an expansion project was completed that moved TSA screening of baggage out of view of passengers and allowed airlines to again check baggage from ticket counters. In 2019, the airport saw a need for a bigger baggage claim area.",
