The format is very similar to his previous Channel 4 shows. On 6 October 2009, the show moved to BBC One, in a new one-hour format. In May 2010, Norton stood in for Chris Evans ' breakfast show on BBC Radio 2 . Later that month, it was confirmed that he would be replacing Jonathan Ross 's Saturday morning slot on the same station. In December 2011, the panel show Would You Rather...? with Graham Norton premiered on BBC America in the time slot immediately following The Graham Norton Show . Recorded in New York, it is one of BBC America's earliest efforts at producing original programming, and is also the first panel game the channel has shown, either of British or American origin. In October 2018, talking to BBC News about his reported 2017–18 BBC salary, Norton said that he genuinely \"doesn't know\" how the corporation arrived at that figure. \"Myself and my agent look at that number and we go 'I wonder how they came up with that',\" he says. \"It bears no relation to anything I know. But if that's what they say I earn, that's what I earn.\" In February 2019, it was announced that Norton would be a judge on RuPaul's Drag Race UK alongside Alan Carr in a rotating basis.

Unlike Steve Wright in the Afternoon aired from 14:00 to 17:00 on weekdays, it is well established as being a \"brand\", with its end of each hour style of presentations, although Norton regularly uses the standard BBC Radio 2 jingles along with jingles unique to the Saturday morning show, written and",
