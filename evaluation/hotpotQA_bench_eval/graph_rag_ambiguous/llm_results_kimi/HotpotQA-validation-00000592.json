O'Donnell interrogated him about his recent unpaid commercial for the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and questioned him about the NRA's position on the use of \" assault weapons \". She said at the end of the segment the conversation had \"not gone the way I had hoped\" and added \"if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today.\" Ironically, O'Donnell at that time was a multi-million dollar paid spokesperson for 5 years for Kmart , which was the largest volume firearms retailer in the United States. Around the same time, the cast from Annie Get Your Gun was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line \"I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge\" from the song \" Anything You Can Do \" and agreed to perform \"My Defenses Are Down\" instead. Later in 1999, O'Donnell discontinued her contract with Kmart as their spokeswoman, as gun enthusiasts complained that she should not be the spokesperson for the largest gun retailer. O'Donnell countered that Kmart sells hunting rifles, not handguns or assault weapons and does so legally, which she supports. Both Kmart and O'Donnell denied publicly that Kmart had terminated the contract. In May 2000, O'Donnell's bodyguard applied for a concealed firearm permit . O'Donnell stated that the security firm contracted by Warner Bros. requested the gun. O'Donnell stated that because of threats, she and her family need protection. After the September 11, 2001 attacks , Broadway and tourism in New York City was down and many shows were in danger of closing. O'Donnell was among many in the entertainment field who encouraged viewers to visit and support the performing arts.

Sharkey , having previously starred in two eponymous half-hour programs, an ABC variety series titled The Don Rickles Show (1968) and a CBS sitcom identically titled The Don Rickles Show (1972). A veteran headline performer at Las Vegas hotel-casinos and peripheral member of the Rat Pack via friendship with Frank Sinatra , Rickles received widespread exposure as a frequent guest on talk and variety shows, including The Dean Martin Show , The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson , and The Late Show with David Letterman , and voiced Mr. Potato Head in the first three films of the Toy Story franchise (1995–2010). He won a Primetime Emmy Award for the 2006 documentary Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project .

He was honorably discharged in 1946. Two years later, intending to be a dramatic Shakespearian actor, he studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and then played bit parts on television. Frustrated by a lack of acting work, Rickles began to perform comedy in clubs in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. He became known as an insult comedian when he responded to his hecklers. The audience enjoyed these insults more than his prepared material, so he incorporated them into his act. When Rickles started his career in the early 1950s, he began to call ill-mannered members of the audience \" hockey pucks \". His style was similar to that of older insult comic Jack E. Leonard , though Rickles denied Leonard influenced his style. During an interview on Larry",

Also that year he was the subject of controversy in the United Kingdom when, on his Channel 4 show, he joked, \"I bet Maurice Gibb 's heart monitor was singing the tune of ' Stayin' Alive '\", referring to the recent death of the Bee Gees singer. Gibb's brother Robin described Norton as \"scum\", threatened to \"rip his head off\" if he saw him, and demanded an apology from him, the show's producers, and Channel 4. The Independent Television Commission investigated after complaints about this insensitivity were received and eventually Channel 4 had to make two apologies: one in the form of a caption slide before the show, another from Norton in person. In summer 2004, Norton ventured into American television. The Graham Norton Effect debuted on 24 June 2004, on Comedy Central , and was also broadcast in the UK on BBC Three .

In 2000, the Lincoln Filmmaker’s Trophy was established. This award was one of only two honors, along with the HBO Short Film Award, that would survive the festival’s move to Florida in 2002. Early hosts and presenters included Robert Townsend (1997), Denzel Washington (1998), Isaac Hayes (1999 and 2000), and Mari Morrow and Kim Whitley who co-hosted the event in 2001. Aside from awards, the festival in its early incarnations had seminars, actors’ training workshops and meet-and-greets, all with the aim of strengthening the skills and networks of black filmmakers, actors and actresses, and screenwriters. Changes from 2002-Present The year 2002 saw many changes for the film festival. Jeff Friday took over execution of the festival, which he renamed the American Black Film Festival (also abbreviated as ABFF). The festival was moved to South Beach, Florida . Since its transformation in 2002, the ABFF has drawn new corporate sponsors (including Grey Goose , Ford , NBC , CBS , and Nickelodeon ) and a dramatically increased attendance. The first Black Movie Awards to be televised were in 2005, with a ceremony hosted by Cedric the Entertainer , which was aired on Turner Network Television ; the 2006 ceremony was hosted by Tyler Perry . The Festival stayed in Florida until 2007 when it was moved to Los Angeles, California , in an effort to attract more celebrity attendees and thereby generating more general interest in the festival. While initially successful, the change in venue ultimately resulted in a decline in attendance from members of the actual Black filmmaking community. The festival changed venues once more in 2010, returning to Florida. Festival Events Typically, there will be an opening ceremony, either featuring a big-name movie or an award presentation. The following days will include screenings of other films, actors’ and directors’ workshops, and symposiums. Each year, the festival concludes with the main awards ceremony. Hosts of this ceremony have included: Robert Townsend and Shaun Robinson , Anthony Anderson , and Niecy Nash . Programming Initiatives The festival has five objectives, or \"Programming Initiatives\" which are: Education in the form of programs to teach and help develop the skills of African-Americans in film. Artistic Expression through screening of African-American films. Collaboration between members of the black cinema industry thereby strengthening the industry as a whole. Access to \"industry insiders\" for up-and-coming filmmakers and producers. Recognition of outstanding work on the part of Black independent filmmakers. Influence Numerous Hollywood insiders, including director Antoine Fuqua (Director of ‘’ Training Day ’’) and Charlie Jordan Brookins of MTV Films have endorsed the festival, as well as rapper/actor Common who has stated that,",

Lewis, and Warrington Hudlin to counter Hollywood’s exclusion of Black talent by providing networking, training, and showcase opportunities. After annual gatherings in Acapulco featuring awards like the Trailblazer and HBO Short Film Award, the event was rebranded ABFF and relocated to South Beach, Florida, in 2002 under Friday’s leadership, attracting major sponsors and televised ceremonies. Venue shifts to Los Angeles (2007) and back to Florida (2010) responded to attendance and community-engagement dynamics. Core programming now combines film screenings with educational workshops, symposiums, and an Oscar-qualifying awards ceremony, all aimed at developing, celebrating, and connecting Black filmmakers and performers.  \n\n**Keywords**:  \nABFF history, Black cinema showcase, festival relocation, filmmaker development, Oscar-qualifying event",
