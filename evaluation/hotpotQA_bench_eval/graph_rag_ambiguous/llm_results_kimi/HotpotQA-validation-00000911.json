      "text": "Apiaceae ( / ˌ eɪ p i ˈ eɪ s i . iː , - ˌ aɪ / ⓘ ), also called Umbelliferae , is a family of mostly aromatic flowering plants named after the type genus Apium , and commonly known as the celery , carrot , or parsley family , or simply as umbellifers . It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,800 species in about 446 genera , including such well-known, and economically important plants as ajwain , angelica , anise , asafoetida , caraway , carrot , celery , chervil , coriander , cumin , dill , fennel , lovage , cow parsley , parsley , parsnip and sea holly , as well as silphium , a plant whose exact identity is unclear and which may be extinct. The family Apiaceae includes a significant number of phototoxic species, such as giant hogweed , and a smaller number of highly poisonous species, such as poison hemlock , water hemlock , spotted cowbane , fool's parsley , and various species of water dropwort . Description Most Apiaceae are annual , biennial or perennial herbs (frequently with the leaves aggregated toward the base), though a minority are woody shrubs or small trees such as Bupleurum fruticosum . Their leaves are of variable size, and alternately arranged , or with the upper leaves becoming nearly opposite. The leaves may be petiolate or sessile . There are no stipules but the petioles are frequently sheathing, and the leaves may be perfoliate . The leaf blade is usually dissected, ternate , or pinnatifid , but simple, and entire in some genera, e.g. Bupleurum . Commonly, their leaves emit a marked smell when crushed, aromatic to fetid, but absent in some species. The defining characteristic of this family is the inflorescence , the flowers nearly always aggregated in terminal umbels , that may be simple or more commonly compound, often umbelliform cymes . The flowers are usually perfect ( hermaphroditic ), and actinomorphic , but there may be zygomorphic flowers at the edge of the umbel, as in carrot ( Daucus carota ) and coriander , with petals of unequal size, the ones pointing outward from the umbel larger than the ones pointing inward. Some are andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or even dioecious (as in Acronema ), with a distinct calyx , and corolla , but the calyx is often highly reduced, to the point of being undetectable in many species, while the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or purple. The flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous , with five petals",

      "text": "Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae . The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat . This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing. It includes some common wildflowers , such as the California buckwheat ( Eriogonum fasciculatum ). The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux , explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus ( E. tomentosum ) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ( \"planta lanata, geniculata\" ). Despite sharing the common name \"buckwheat\", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat . In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened. One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat ( Eriogonum truncatum , believed to be extinct) was rediscovered. Ecology Eriogonum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). An example of a butterfly that uses this plant for food is the Lycaena heteronea . Several of these are monophagous , meaning their caterpillars only feed on this genus, sometimes just on a single taxon of Eriogonum . Wild buckwheat flowers are also an important source of food for these and other Lepidoptera. In some cases, the relationship is so close that Eriogonum and dependent Lepidoptera are in danger of coextinction . Monophagous Lepidoptera on wild buckwheat include: Apodemia mormo (Mormon metalmark) – feeds exclusively on Eriogonum Apodemia mormo langei (Lange's metalmark) – only known from Eriogonum nudum ssp. auriculatum Chionodes dammersi – feeds exclusively on Eriogonum Chionodes luteogeminatus – only known from Eriogonum niveum Euphilotes enoptes smithi ( Smith's blue butterfly ) – only known from Eriogonum latifolium and Eriogonum parvifolium Euphilotes battoides allyni ( El Segundo blue butterfly ) - only known from Eriogonum parvifolium Additionally, bees of the sagebrush steppe rely on the nectar of desert buckwheats, and birds and rodents eat the seeds.

      "text": "Silene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae . Containing nearly 900 species, it is the largest genus in the family. Common names include campion and catchfly . Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Scientific history Members of this genus have been the subject of research by preeminent plant ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists, including Charles Darwin , Gregor Mendel , Carl Correns , Herbert G. Baker , and Janis Antonovics . Many Silene species continue to be widely used to study systems, particularly in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. The genus has been used as a model for understanding the genetics of sex determination for over a century. Silene species commonly contain a mixture of hermaphroditic and female (or male-sterile) individuals ( gynodioecy ), and early studies by Correns showed that male sterility could be maternally inherited, an example of what is now known as cytoplasmic male sterility . Two independent groups of species in Silene have evolved separate male and female sexes ( dioecy ) with chromosomal sex determination that is analogous to the system found in humans and other mammals. Silene flowers are frequently visited by flies, such as Rhingia campestris . Silene species have also been used to study speciation, host-pathogen interactions, biological species invasions, adaptation to heavy-metal-contaminated soils, metapopulation genetics, and organelle genome evolution. Notably, some members of the genus Silene hold the distinction of harboring the largest mitochondrial genomes ever identified. Taxonomy Silene was originally described by Linnaeus . Divisions of the genus into subgenera or sections before 2003 do not seem to be well-supported by molecular evidence. The genus Lychnis is closely related to (and sometimes included in) Silene . When treated as a distinct genus, it can often be differentiated by the number of flower styles (five in Lychnis' and three in Silene ), the number of teeth of the seed capsule (five in Lychnis' and six in Silene ), and by the sticky stems of Lychnis . Sexual systems Sexual systems vary across species. Most Silene species are hermaphroditic representing 58.2% of Silene species, 14.3% are dioecious , 13.3% gynodioecious , and 12.2% are both gynodioecious and gynomonoecious . Trioecy , andromonoecy , and gynomonoecy have also been reported but are extremely rare. Etymology Silene is the feminine form of Silenus , an Ancient Greek woodland deity who was a companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus . Species Ecology Lychnis is also the common name of",

      "text": "Elodea is a genus of eight species of aquatic plants often called the waterweeds described as a genus in 1803. Classified in the frog's-bit family ( Hydrocharitaceae ), Elodea is native to the Americas and is also widely used as aquarium vegetation and laboratory demonstrations of cellular activities. It lives in fresh water. An older name for this genus is Anacharis , which serves as a common name in North America. The introduction of some species of Elodea into waterways in parts of Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand has created a significant problem and it is now considered a noxious weed in these areas. Species Elodea bifoliata H.St.John – Canada ( AB , SK ), W United States ( OR + CA to NM + MN ) Elodea callitrichoides (Rich.)

H.St.John – much of United States + Canada Elodea potamogeton (Bertero) Espinosa – Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador Chemical control Chemical methods are ineffective in eradicating Elodea – at best they only slow growth for a season or two. As Elodea spreads into new ecosystems, it experiences rapid growth for 5–6 years and then slows as soil nutrients are used up. Elodea is threatening aquatic environments across Europe. Chemicals may be used in places that cause undue economic concerns, but very few aquatic herbicides are registered for aquatic use in the EU. Fluridone , the most commonly used aquatic herbicide is highly effective against Hydrilla, but only marginally effective against Elodea, especially at lower use rates. Mechanical control An aquatic weed harvester collecting Elodea from a lake The plants can also be removed from lakes and rivers mechanically. They are extracted either by hand or by using rakes, chains, mowing boats or weed buckets. The problem is that through vegetative reproduction via fragments, mechanical removal methods can contribute to the spread of the plant. Torn fragments can be transported downstream or are introduced to new environments via attachment to boats and anchor chains.

While widely cultivated for edible roots, seeds, and aromatic oils, some species contain toxic compounds like furanocoumarins, causing photodermatitis, or are highly poisonous (e.g., poison hemlock). The family also includes phototoxic species such as giant hogweed and historically significant plants used for poisons, dyes, or incense.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nApiaceae, umbellifers, phototoxicity, culinary herbs, companion planting",

A modern taxonomic revision led by the Compton Herbarium and SANBI is underway, beginning with the 2019 treatment of the geophytic O. bulbosa group. The name Othonna references a linen cloth, alluding to the downy indumentum of early-known species, and several species are colloquially called “bobbejaankool” (baboon cabbages) in Afrikaans.\n\n**Keywords**: Othonna, Crassothonna, Cape Floristic Region, taxonomic revision, succulent perennials",
