In 2011 he played the lead role in a film Restoration , a role for which he was nominated for an Ophir Award. He won the IFFI Best Actor Award (Male) at the 42nd International Film Festival of India . Gabai also played one of the leading roles in the highly acclaimed Israeli TV series Shtisel , which to date, has run for three seasons (2013-2021). Gabai played the role of Nuchem Shtisel, the paternal uncle of the main protagonist, Akiva Shtisel. Nuchem is also the brother of Shulem Shtisel and father of Libbi Shtisel, Akiva's first cousin, and love interest. Nuchem is an Antwerp-based travel agent who shows up at Shulem's apartment with his daughter Libbi, at the beginning of Season 2. One of Nuchem's first lines in the show is when he explains why he is late, blaming the immigration/custom officials at Ben Gurion airport, and calling them Reshaim Arrurim (Yiddish vernacular for \"accursed evil people\"). Reshaim Arrurim is a line Nuchem reprises to great comedic effect, at the slightest perceived slight, throughout the season. It was initially announced on 28 February 2018 that Gabai would reprise his role as Tewfiq in the Broadway adaptation of The Band's Visit in the summer of 2018. The lead producer of The Band's Visit , Orin Wolf, confirmed the news in a press conference on 10 June, following the 72nd Annual Tony Awards (in which The Band's Visit won ten awards, including Best Musical ).

      "text": "Family Matters is an American television sitcom that originally aired on ABC for eight seasons from September 22, 1989, to May 9, 1997, then moved to CBS for its ninth and final season from September 19, 1997, to July 17, 1998. A spin-off of Perfect Strangers , the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois . Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel ( Jaleel White ), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast. Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African-American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted shows that started in the 1980s and have lasted longer in continuous production is The Simpsons and The Bold and the Beautiful . History The series was a spinoff from the ABC sitcom Perfect Strangers ; both shows aired Friday nights as part of the network's family-oriented \" TGIF \" lineup. Jo Marie Payton played Harriette Winslow, the elevator operator at a newspaper where Larry Appleton and Balki Bartokomous also worked. Reginald VelJohnson , who was coming off of growing fame from his role in Die Hard , made an appearance on the show as Harriette's husband Carl Winslow, a Chicago police officer. ABC and the producers loved the character Harriette for her great morale and quick-witted humor and decided to create a show that would focus on her and her family, husband Carl, son Eddie, elder daughter Laura, and younger daughter Judy (who appeared until the character was retconned after season four as having not existed). In the pilot episode , \" The Mama Who Came to Dinner \", the family had also opened their home to Carl's street-wise mother, Estelle ( Rosetta LeNoire ), usually known as \"Mother Winslow\". Prior to the start of the series, Harriette's sister, Rachel Crawford and her infant son, Richie, had moved into the Winslow household after the death of Rachel's husband. The Winslows' nerdy teenage next-door neighbor, Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), was introduced early in the first season, given a significant role midway through the season in the episode \"Laura’s First Date\", and quickly became the focus of the show. The popular sitcom was a mainstay of ABC's TGIF lineup from 1989 until 1997, at which",

The live-action series was created by Robert Smigel , Michael Koman , and David Feldman . The series features Jack McBrayer playing Jack Mlicki, the former child star of a fictional Lassie -like series. The puppet Triumph the Insult Comic Dog represents his co-star from that series. The series was initially picked up for 20 episodes, but when only 7 episodes had aired, in August 2015 Dino Stamatopoulos confirmed that it would not be returning. Plot The show is about two former child actors (Jack McBrayer and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog) who starred in a Lassie -like show from the 1980s and 1990s called Triumph's Boy . Jack had grown up playing the role of the small boy in the series even as he grew into adulthood. Though he is kind-hearted and optimistic, being a child actor had led to Jack being sheltered, naive, and socially awkward. After their show's cancellation, Jack and Triumph lived an indulgent and morally questionable lifestyle with the money they had made from the show. However, when Jack finds out that his parents had squandered all his earnings, he and Triumph are forced into a life of thievery and prostitution. This goes on until Jack decides to visit June Gregory, who played the role of his mother in Triumph's Boy . She agrees to take in both him and Triumph on the condition that Jack does not go back into acting and instead tries to get back on the straight and narrow path of a normal, Christian lifestyle. She grows ever more disdainful of Triumph, who continues to be a trouble-making nuisance, and eventually comes up with a plan to get rid of him. June arranges for Jack to go on a wilderness trip. Right after he leaves, she tells Triumph to get in the car because Pet Smart is having a sale on used kitty litter. She gives Triumph a handheld game to occupy him on the ride and drives to Montana, where she throws him into a ditch and abandons him. She gets home seconds before Jack returns from his trip and tells him that Triumph had left to get cigars and never came back. Over the course of 15 years, June helps teach Jack how to live a normal life while Triumph follows her scent back to her house, picking up many jobs along the way to sustain himself. Jack greets him warmly, but June fakes feeling ill and tells Jack to go get her medication. While Jack is upstairs, June and Triumph yell angrily at each other until they come to an agreement: Triumph will not tell Jack what June did to him as long as Triumph can stay and live with the two of them. Triumph is dead-set on getting Jack and himself back into",

It premiered September 10, 2010, on Disney Channel and September 22, 2010, on Disney XD . The series stars Doc Shaw and Mitchel Musso in seasons 1 and 2 with the latter being replaced by Adam Hicks for season 3. The series revolves around a pair of Chicago -born teenaged fraternal twin brothers who discover they are rulers of a fictitious Pacific island nation. On November 20, 2010, Disney XD announced Pair of Kings had been renewed for a second season, which premiered on June 13, 2011. In December 2011, the series was renewed for a third season. The third season premiered on June 18, 2012. However, on November 3, 2012, it was announced that Disney XD would not renew Pair of Kings for a fourth season. The show is filmed before a live studio audience , but uses a laugh track . Premise The series tells the story of brothers Brady ( Mitchel Musso ) and Boomer ( Doc Shaw ), a pair of teenage fraternal twins raised by their aunt and uncle in Chicago who live a normal existence. However, when Mason ( Geno Segers ), the royal adviser to the throne of the island of Kinkow, arrives at their high school, they learn that they are the heirs to the throne of the island, and after Mason tells Brady and Boomer of their lineage, they begin to realize that their lives are about to change drastically and will try to be brave and face their fears. Seventeen years earlier, the boys' mother, Annabelle, was an archeologist who was brought to the island and married King Kunu, their father, thus marrying into the Kinkowan royal line. Kaita the Bat-Rider, leader of the Tarantula People, killed Annabelle and Kunu during the Tarantula Wars. Kaita was later mummified. The brothers relocate to the fictional island of Kinkow to assume their roles as the co-kings of the island nation, which has many odd customs and superstitions – while trying not to cause problems. The oldest brother was meant to rule alone, but, since all records of which twin is elder were lost, the two of them must rule together as a diarchy . In an episode in early October 2011, there was a chance to find out who was older, but the scroll that held the answer fell into a volcano, so no one will ever find out who has the seniority to be the lone ruler. Boomer and Brady's efforts are often aided by Mason's teenage daughter Mikayla ( Kelsey Chow ) and hindered by Lanny ( Ryan Ochoa ), a",

The popular sitcom was a mainstay of ABC's TGIF lineup from 1989 until 1997, at which point it became part of the CBS Block Party lineup for its final season. Family Matters was produced by Bickley-Warren Productions (1991–1998) and Miller-Boyett Productions , in association with Lorimar Television (1989–1993) and later Warner Bros. Television (1993–1998). As the show progressed, episodes began to center increasingly on Steve Urkel, and other original characters also played by White, including Steve's suave alter-ego, Stefan Urquelle (who is similar to Jaleel White 's real-life self), and his female cousin, Myrtle Urkel. Network change In early 1997, CBS picked up Family Matters and Step by Step in a $40 million deal to acquire the rights to the programs from ABC. ABC then promised to pay Miller-Boyett Productions $1.5 million per episode for a ninth and tenth season of Family Matters . However, tensions had risen between Miller-Boyett Productions and ABC's corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company (which had bought ABC in 1996 as part of its merger with ABC's then-parent Capital Cities/ABC Inc. ). Miller-Boyett thought that it would not be a big player on ABC after ABC's recent purchase by Disney. Miller-Boyett Productions agreed to a $40 million offer from CBS for a 22-episode season for both Family Matters and Step By Step . CBS scheduled Family Matters along with Meego and Step By Step as a part of its new Friday lineup, branded as the CBS Block Party . The network scheduled the family-oriented block against ABC's TGIF lineup, where the two series originated. Jo Marie Payton's contract had just expired and she was reluctant to continue, feeling the show had jumped the shark years prior. She agreed to stay to keep continuity but left midseason shortly after nearly getting into a physical altercation with White in what would be her last regular episode; in that episode, White (playing a gangster instead of his usual Urkel) was attempting to insert material that violated Broadcast Standards and Practices . The resulting dispute between White and Payton escalated to the point where Darius McCrary had to separate the two. Payton would appear in only one more episode after that—a Christmas episode that also brought back several former characters from the ABC run who had been written out on CBS—before Judyann Elder took over as Harriette for the remainder of the season. While Family Matters continued to lose viewership compared to previous years, it was initially a modest success on CBS, beating the show that replaced it, You Wish .
