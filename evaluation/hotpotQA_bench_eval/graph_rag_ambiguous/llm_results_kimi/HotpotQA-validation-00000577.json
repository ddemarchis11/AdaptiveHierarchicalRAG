Szasz first presented his attack on \"mental illness\" as a legal term in 1958 in the Columbia Law Review . In his article he argued that mental illness was no more a fact bearing on a suspect's guilt than is possession by the devil . His books The Myth of Mental Illness (1961) and The Manufacture of Madness (1970) set out some of the arguments most associated with him. In 1961, Szasz testified before a United States Senate committee , arguing that using mental hospitals to incarcerate people defined as insane violated the general assumptions of the patient–doctor relationship, and turned the doctor into a warden and keeper of a prison. Szasz was convinced there was a metaphorical character to mental disorders, and its uses in psychiatry were frequently injurious. He set himself a task to delegitimize legitimating agencies and authorities, and what he saw as their vast powers, enforced by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, mental health laws, mental health courts, and mental health sentences. Szasz was a critic of the influence of modern medicine on society, which he considered to be the secularization of religion's hold on humankind. Criticizing scientism , he targeted psychiatry in particular, underscoring its campaigns against masturbation at the end of the 19th century, its use of medical imagery and language to describe misbehavior, its reliance on involuntary mental hospitalization to protect society, and the use of lobotomy and other interventions to treat psychosis .  Szasz consistently paid attention to the power of language in the establishment and maintenance of the social order, both in small interpersonal and in wider social, economic, and/or political spheres.  Positions Mental illness is a myth In Szasz's view, people who are said to have a mental illness only have \"problems in living\". Diagnoses of \"mental illness\" or \"mental disorder\" are passed off as scientific but are judgments (of disdain) to support certain uses of power by authorities. In that line of thinking, schizophrenia becomes not the name of a disease entity but a judgment of extreme psychiatric and social disapprobation. Szasz called schizophrenia \"the sacred symbol of psychiatry\" because those so labeled have long provided and continue to provide justification for psychiatric theories, treatments, abuses, and reforms. He argued that psychiatry is a pseudoscience that parodies medicine by using medical-sounding words and that, supported by the state through various Mental Health Acts, it has become a modern secular state religion . As a vastly elaborate social control system which disguises itself under the claims of being rational, systematic and therefore scientific, it constitutes a fundamental threat to freedom and dignity. In The Myth of Mental Illness he argued that people can only play \"the mental illness game\" if their partner and those around them play a complementary role – a situation that would later be described as",

      "text": "Thomas Stephen Szasz ( / s ɑː s / SAHSS ; Hungarian : Szász Tamás István [saːs] ; 15 April 1920 – 8 September 2012) was a Hungarian-American academic and psychiatrist . He served for most of his career as professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University . A distinguished lifetime fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and a life member of the American Psychoanalytic Association , he was best known as a social critic of the moral and scientific foundations of psychiatry , as what he saw as the social control aims of medicine in modern society, as well as scientism . Szasz maintained throughout his career that he was not anti-psychiatry but rather that he opposed coercive psychiatry. He was a staunch opponent of civil commitment and involuntary psychiatric treatment, but he believed in and practiced psychiatry and psychotherapy that involved consenting adults. Life and death Szasz was born on April 15, 1920, in Budapest , Hungary, the second son of Jewish parents Gyula and Lily Szász. In 1938, the family moved to the United States, where he attended the University of Cincinnati for his Bachelor of Science in physics, followed by an MD . Szasz completed his residency requirement at the Cincinnati General Hospital , then trained as a psychoanalyst at Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis from 1951 to 1956. He took a position as a professor at State University of New York in 1956 and received tenure in 1962, taking 24 months out for duty as a practicing psychiatrist with the U.S. Naval Reserve . Szasz had two daughters. His wife, Rosine, died in 1971. Szasz's colleague Jeff Schaler described her death as a suicide. Thomas Szasz ended his own life on September 8, 2012, after suffering a painful spinal-compression fracture from a recent fall. Szasz had previously argued for the right to die in his writings. Career Thomas Szasz was a strong critic of institutional psychiatry and was a prolific writer. According to psychiatrist Tony B. Benning, there were \"three major themes in Szasz's writings: his contention that there is no such thing as mental illness, his contention that individual responsibility is never compromised in those suffering from what is generally considered as mental illness, and his perennial interest in calling attention to the political nature of psychiatric diagnosis\". According to Williams and Caplan, Szasz is \"best known for his view that without a diagnosis of neurological disease or damage, a psychiatric diagnosis was meaningless\". Though his ideas had little influence on mainstream psychiatry, many were supported by some behavioral and social scientists.  Szasz first presented his attack on \"mental illness\" as a legal term in 1958 in the Columbia Law Review . In his article he argued that mental illness was no more a fact bearing on a suspect's",

The center's mission is to provide therapeutic services to bereaved children and their families; to make intervention more accessible; to heighten awareness of the potentially harmful short- and long-term effects of loss; and to provide training and consultation for teachers, clergy, mental health workers, and other involved community members.

      "text": "The Chicago Psychoanalytic Institute (formerly Institute for Psychoanalysis until it was renamed in May 2018) is a center for psychoanalytic research, training, and education on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago . The institute provides professional training in the theory and practice of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy . It was founded in 1932 by Franz Alexander , a pioneer in psychosomatic medicine at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute , who moved to Chicago at the invitation of Robert Maynard Hutchins , then president of the University of Chicago . Notable psychoanalysts that have been associated with the institute include Karl Menninger , Julius B. Richmond , Karen Horney , Thomas Szasz , Therese Benedek , Hedda Bolgar , Roy R. Grinker, Sr. , Maxwell Gitelson, Louis Shapiro, Heinz Kohut , Arnold Goldberg , Jerome Kavka , Frank Summers, Ernest A. Rappaport, and Michael Franz Basch. History The Chicago Institute is the second oldest in the United States , preceded by New York five months earlier, and followed by Boston and Washington. It was incorporated on February 25, 1932, with Franz Alexander as the first director. Alexander's first associate was Karen Horney , who had been another student at the Berlin Institute . Alexander and Horney appointed three more to form the first staff. They were: Thomas French as Lecturer and Clinical Associate, Helen McLean and Catherine Bacon as Clinical Associates. There were also two visiting lecturers: Karl Menninger and Lionel Blitzstein. From the beginning, the Chicago Institute has nurtured innovative, and occasionally revolutionary, approaches to the psychoanalytic theory and practice originally formulated by Sigmund Freud in Vienna. Alexander wanted to experiment with frequency of sessions, length of treatment and how the analyst should optimally conduct himself. He published his ideas in several books, and became an outspoken advocate for such experimentation. Alexander left Chicago for California in 1955. He was succeeded by Gerhard Piers as the director of the institute. The group of analysts who became the dominant voices at the institute had been greatly influenced by Lionel Blitzstein, who had analyzed them all. Though Blitzsten had been on the early faculty of the institute, he and Alexander were at odds. With his ascendance the institute reinstated practices that were considered more in line with the dominant American view of depth and intensity of psychoanalytic treatment. The intellectual leader of this group was Maxwell Gitelson. Joan Fleming became Dean of Education, and the curriculum emphasized a more thorough historical approach to teaching psychoanalysis. The 1960s witnessed one of the most vibrant creative periods in the institute's history. Two important theoretical developments occurred. One was a collective research project that concerned parent loss. Fleming's research group observed that there seemed to be an arrest of the personality at the age of the child when the parent died, associated with an absence of mourning. From these findings, the group reasoned that intervention at the time",

In The Myth of Mental Illness he argued that people can only play \"the mental illness game\" if their partner and those around them play a complementary role – a situation that would later be described as codependency . Separate psychiatry and the state Szasz believed that if we accept that \"mental illness\" is a euphemism for behaviors that are disapproved of, then the state has no right to force psychiatric \"treatment\" on these individuals. Similarly, the state should not be able to interfere in mental health practices between consenting adults (for example, by legally controlling the supply of psychotropic drugs or psychiatric medication). The medicalization of government produces a \"therapeutic state\", designating someone as, for example, \"insane\" or as a \"drug addict\". In Ceremonial Chemistry (1974), he argued that the same persecution that targeted witches , Jews, gypsies , and homosexuals now targets \"drug addicts\" and \"insane\" people. Szasz argued that all these categories of people were taken as scapegoats of the community in ritual ceremonies. To underscore this continuation of religion through medicine, he even takes as an example obesity : instead of concentrating on junk food (ill-nutrition), physicians denounced hypernutrition. According to Szasz, despite their scientific appearance, the diets imposed were a moral substitute to the former fasts , and the social injunction not to be overweight is to be considered as a moral order, not as scientific advice as it claims to be. As with those thought bad (insane people), and those who took the wrong drugs (drug addicts), medicine created a category for those who had the wrong weight (obesity). Szasz argued that psychiatrics were created in the 17th century to study and control those who erred from the medical norms of social behavior; a new specialization, \"drogophobia\", was created in the 20th century to study and control those who erred from the medical norms of drug consumption; and then, in the 1960s, another specialization, bariatrics (from the Greek βάρος baros, for \"weight\"), was created to deal with those who erred from the medical norms concerning the weight the body should have. Thus, he underscores that in 1970 the American Society of Bariatric Physicians had 30 members, and already 450 two years later.  The therapeutic state The \"therapeutic state\" is a phrase coined by Szasz in 1963. The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the therapeutic state , a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed (\"cured\") through pseudomedical interventions. Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating,",
