It follows a slick gambler named Russell Donovan ( Bill Bixby ) who is duped into taking care of three orphans who eventually strike gold. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions . The film is based on the 1971 novel of the same name by Jack M. Bickham . Don Tait wrote the screenplay. The so-called \"Apple Dumpling Gang\" are named after their favorite American dessert treat, the apple dumpling . It is also known as being the first film to feature the comedy duo of Don Knotts and Tim Conway . Buddy Baker composed the music for the film and its sequel, The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again , with Joseph Dubin performing the orchestration. The song \"The Apple Dumpling Gang\", as heard in the opening and closing credits , was composed by Shane Tatum and was performed by Randy Sparks and the Back Porch Majority . Plot In the Wild West in 1879, a slick gambler named Russell Donovan comes to the town of Quake City en route to open a casino in New Orleans . There, he meets his old associate, John Wintle, who is leaving for San Francisco and asks Donovan to sign for valuables coming in on the next day's stagecoach . Donovan accepts a down payment and promises to pick them up. The next day, he realizes he has been duped into taking care of three little orphans named Bobby, Clovis, and Celia Bradley. The stagecoach driver, Magnolia \"Dusty\" Clydesdale, explains that Wintle is in fact their relative and legal guardian. With him gone and Donovan promising to care for the \"valuables\", they are now his wards. The town's sheriff , barber , and justice of the peace , Homer McCoy, tells him that he is legally obligated unless he can have someone else take custody of them. The children cause Donovan much grief by offending all prospective new guardians. They wreak havoc in Quake City while riding in an old mine cart, destroying much private property. The townspeople demand that Donovan pay for the damage, costing him most of his funds for his trip to New Orleans. Donovan becomes the target of Amos Tucker and Theodore Ogelvie, former members of the Stillwell Gang who were ousted by their former boss, Frank Stillwell, for shooting him in the leg. They continuously try to rob Donovan during his stay in town with unsuccessful results. The children decide to help Donovan earn money by going to the gold mine that they inherited. They encounter Amos and Theodore at their hideout, who direct the children to the mine after mistaking them for a posse. The children discover a massive gold nugget in the mine, which incentivizes many people to adopt them as it would give them access to the gold.

It stars Tom McGowan , Aaron Schwartz , Shaun Weiss , Tom Hodges , Leah Lail , Paul Feig , Kenan Thompson , David Bowe , Max Goldblatt , Robert Zalkind, Patrick LaBrecque, Jeffrey Tambor , Jerry Stiller , Anne Meara , and Ben Stiller (in a dual role), and follows a fat camp for kids that is taken over by a fitness entrepreneur as its campers work to overthrow him. The film was released on February 17, 1995. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb , only making $17.7 million on a $10 million budget. Though it was initially met with mixed reviews, it found a following on home video and cable TV airings and has since become a cult film . Plot When school ends for the summer, Gerry Garner is told by his parents that they are sending him to Camp Hope, a weight loss camp for boys. Initially reluctant, Gerry meets enthusiastic camp counselor Pat, and befriends the other campers, who have smuggled in enough junk food for the entire summer. The first night at Camp Hope brings the revelation that the original owners, the Bushkins, have declared bankruptcy and the camp has been bought by fitness entrepreneur Tony Perkis Jr., who plans to transform the camp’s weight loss program into a best-selling infomercial . Tony replaces the camp’s beloved activities, including go-karts and “ the Blob ”, with a punishing exercise regimen. Pat is replaced by the strict new counselor Lars and the campers endure a painful softball game against their more athletic, over-competitive rivals Camp MVP . When Tony purges the cabins ' hidden food caches, camper Josh stands up for Gerry by taunting Tony and is sent home without a refund. Tony arranges a dance with the girls' summer camp named Camp Magnolia to humiliate the boys into losing weight, but counselors Tim, Pat, and camp nurse Julie convince everyone to enjoy themselves together. Josh returns to Camp Hope revealing that his lawyer father has threatened to sue Tony for kicking his son out without a refund. Gerry and his friends sneak into Tony's office in search of their confiscated snacks, and learn that Tony has intercepted all the campers’ letters to their families, including a letter that Gerry wrote to his grandmother. They discover a secret food stash used by most of the camp, leading them to gain weight, and Tony forces the boys on a 20-mile hike, preparing to endanger their lives for the sake of fitness. The boys trick Tony into falling into a pit and imprison him at camp in a makeshift cell, electrified with a bug zapper . With Pat, Julie, and Tim on their side, the campers take back control of Camp Hope, tying up Lars in the woods with Tony's other counselors, and celebrating with",

It premiered September 10, 2010, on Disney Channel and September 22, 2010, on Disney XD . The series stars Doc Shaw and Mitchel Musso in seasons 1 and 2 with the latter being replaced by Adam Hicks for season 3. The series revolves around a pair of Chicago -born teenaged fraternal twin brothers who discover they are rulers of a fictitious Pacific island nation. On November 20, 2010, Disney XD announced Pair of Kings had been renewed for a second season, which premiered on June 13, 2011. In December 2011, the series was renewed for a third season. The third season premiered on June 18, 2012. However, on November 3, 2012, it was announced that Disney XD would not renew Pair of Kings for a fourth season. The show is filmed before a live studio audience , but uses a laugh track . Premise The series tells the story of brothers Brady ( Mitchel Musso ) and Boomer ( Doc Shaw ), a pair of teenage fraternal twins raised by their aunt and uncle in Chicago who live a normal existence. However, when Mason ( Geno Segers ), the royal adviser to the throne of the island of Kinkow, arrives at their high school, they learn that they are the heirs to the throne of the island, and after Mason tells Brady and Boomer of their lineage, they begin to realize that their lives are about to change drastically and will try to be brave and face their fears. Seventeen years earlier, the boys' mother, Annabelle, was an archeologist who was brought to the island and married King Kunu, their father, thus marrying into the Kinkowan royal line. Kaita the Bat-Rider, leader of the Tarantula People, killed Annabelle and Kunu during the Tarantula Wars. Kaita was later mummified. The brothers relocate to the fictional island of Kinkow to assume their roles as the co-kings of the island nation, which has many odd customs and superstitions – while trying not to cause problems. The oldest brother was meant to rule alone, but, since all records of which twin is elder were lost, the two of them must rule together as a diarchy . In an episode in early October 2011, there was a chance to find out who was older, but the scroll that held the answer fell into a volcano, so no one will ever find out who has the seniority to be the lone ruler. Boomer and Brady's efforts are often aided by Mason's teenage daughter Mikayla ( Kelsey Chow ) and hindered by Lanny ( Ryan Ochoa ), a",

Executives spent extra on a campaign that branded the film the season’s “romantic alternative,” targeting female audiences and avoiding over-saturation. Sneak previews in 750 theaters reached 80 % capacity, strong word-of-mouth was cultivated through niche screenings, and the strategy paid off: the movie became the summer’s sleeper hit despite facing roughly 60 competing releases.\n\n**Keywords**: counter-programming, summer release, romantic comedy, sleeper hit, TriStar marketing",

Actors performed vocals on-set without backing tracks, guided by hidden earpieces and off-camera cues, while the lyrics comment ironically on the action. The plot pivots on misread motives—pills are harmless Tic Tacs, a feared lay-off list becomes divorce papers, and the manager sacrifices his own job—creating a darkly comic study of miscommunication under the cover of booze and loud music. Critics praised the technical ambition and guest performances but were divided on whether the format enriched or obscured character depth and emotional stakes.\n\n**Keywords**: karaoke, live vocals, miscommunication, Inside No. 9, dark comedy",
