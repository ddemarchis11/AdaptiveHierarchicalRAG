      "text": "Trent John Alexander-Arnold (born 7 October 1998), sometimes known mononymously as Trent , is an English professional footballer who plays as a right-back or midfielder for La Liga club Real Madrid and the England national team . Considered one of the best right-backs in the world, he is known for his range of passing, crossing and assists, as well as his set-piece taking ability. Owing to such capabilities, Alexander-Arnold has also occasionally been deployed as a midfielder for both club and country. Alexander-Arnold joined Liverpool 's academy in 2004 and captained the club across its youth levels. He made his senior debut in 2016, at age 18, and played in back-to-back UEFA Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019 , winning the latter, and being named in the Champions League Squad of the Season. These appearances made him the youngest player to start in consecutive finals in the competition. In the same year, he won the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup . In domestic football, Alexander-Arnold was named the 2019–20 PFA Young Player of the Year and the inaugural Premier League Young Player of the Season , has thrice been named in the PFA Team of the Year , and helped end Liverpool's 30-year league title drought by winning the 2019–20 Premier League . His success in 2020 led to his selection in the FIFA FIFPRO Men's World 11 . In the 2021–22 season, he claimed a domestic cup double, winning the EFL Cup and FA Cup . In 2025, after helping Liverpool to their second Premier League title , Alexander-Arnold joined La Liga club Real Madrid. Alexander-Arnold has also represented England at various youth levels and made his senior debut in 2018. He has since featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup , where he became only the fourth teenager to start a match for England in the tournament, in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League , where his nation finished in third place in the inaugural edition of the competition, and the 2022 World Cup . Early life, education and early career Trent John Alexander-Arnold was born on 7 October 1998 in the West Derby suburb of Liverpool , Merseyside. He attended St Matthew's Catholic Primary School, before later enrolling at St Mary's College in Crosby . When he was six years old, local football club Liverpool hosted a half-term camp to which a number of pupils from his school were invited, and his was one of the names drawn from a hat to attend. There, he was spotted by academy coach Ian Barrigan who subsequently approached his parents to offer him the chance to join the club's academy. He began training two-to-three times a week, and in a variety of different positions, before later going on to captain the club at U16 and",

      "text": "In the 2012–13 season , Sion competes in the Swiss Super League and the Swiss Cup . In the summer transfer window, they brought in Italian World Cup winner Gennaro Gattuso , as well as Kyle Lafferty (former of Rangers ). In addition, they bought an until then unknown Brazilian footballer called Léo Itaperuna from the 5th division Club of Arapongas and another forward Mathieu Manset from Reading . Already signed six months earlier, Oussama Darragi coming from Esperance de Tunis joined the team along with André Marques from Sporting Lisabon. The 2012–13 season began well with Sion staying at the top till the 8th round. Fournier played with a 4-2-3-1 system. On 4 September 2012, Manset, Joaquim Adão and Darragi were all disciplined after being found in the early hours of the morning in a Lausanne nightclub the day before Sion's game away to FC Zürich . Manset's contract with the club was canceled, Adão was demoted to the youth team for one month and Darragi was handed a large fine. This huge upset resulted in the resignation of Sebastien Fournier as coach. Following this change, the results were not as convincing as they were at the beginning. Although Sion scored more goals in the second part of the first half, they ended fourth during the winter break, one point away from 2nd and 5 points from first. This increase in goals was due to the change to a 4-4-2 system with Itaperuna and Laffery as center forwards. The weak spot during the first half was the absence of a winger on the left side. This was because Yoda and Wüthrich were injured at the beginning of the season and never recovered to their original strength. In addition to that, the defense was not as solid as the years before. That resulted in more goals received as in other seasons. The reasons for that were the transfer of the center back Adaílton to Henan Jianye and the simultaneous injuries of Aislan , Vanczák and Sauthier . Vanczák broke this cheekbone , but did play again after two weeks with a mask as there were no backups available. During that time, Basha (normally a defensive midfielder) played as a fullback at the position of Vanczák, while he moved into the center to his original position as a center back.

In May, having made 12 appearances across all competitions, he was named Liverpool's Young Player of the Season and was also nominated for the Premier League 2 Player of the Season award. 2017–18: First Champions League final In the buildup to the 2017–18 season , regular right-back Clyne suffered a serious back injury which afforded Alexander-Arnold the opportunity to rotate with Joe Gomez during the early stages of the campaign. On 15 August 2017, he scored his first goal for the club when he struck home from a free kick in a 2–1 first leg Champions League play-off round win over Bundesliga team 1899 Hoffenheim . In doing so, he became the third youngest player to score on his European debut for Liverpool, after Michael Owen and David Fairclough . During the group stages of the competition, Alexander-Arnold scored again in a 7–0 Champions League win over Maribor on 17 October, a result which was the joint-largest ever away win in the competition, and largest away win by an English club. He then scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool on 26 December in a 5–0 home win over Swansea City . Alexander-Arnold lining up for Liverpool in 2017 In March the following year, Alexander-Arnold endured his most difficult spell with the club to date, after struggling against Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford in successive weeks. Nonetheless, he retained his position in Liverpool's starting line-up to become the youngest English player to start in a Champions League quarter-final match and performed strongly in a 3–0 win over English rivals Manchester City in April. His performance saw him named man of the match and earned him praise from the media for his ability to nullify City winger Leroy Sané . He impressed again in the reverse fixture as Liverpool eliminated City 5–1 on aggregate to advance to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time in 10 years. On 10 May 2018, his domestic and European form was rewarded when he won the Liverpool Young Player of the Season award for the second season running. Later that month, he became the youngest Liverpool player to start in a Champions League final when he was named in the starting line-up against two-time reigning champions, Real Madrid . Tasked with marking Cristiano Ronaldo , he performed admirably though Liverpool ultimately succumbed to a 3–1 defeat.

Founded as \"Bangtoey Football Team\" in 1976, the club changed its name many times, until finally, it became \"BBCU\" in 2011. BBCU was one of the most successful Thai football clubs of the late 1990s (under the name of \"Sinthana Football Club\"). The club has won a Thai League 1 title, 2 Kor Royal Cups and 1 FA Cup . Moreover, during the years in lower divisions, the club has also won a Division 2 title. History Chulalongkorn University FC is a club based at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok , Thailand. They have played in the Chula–Thammasat Traditional Football Match since 1934. In 2004, \"Chulalongkorn University FC\" was combined with \"Sinthana FC\" and took the name, \"Chula–Sinthana FC\" which played in Division 2 in 2005 until Chula-Sinthana FC was promoted from Division 1 to Thai Premier League in 2008. In August of the 2008 season, they changed their club name again from \"Chula–Sinthana FC\" to \"Chula United\". The Club Director was Kasiti Kamalanavin. Chula's return to the top flight, 2008 Thailand Premier League , ended with them finishing in a creditable 8th position. However, they could not build on their first season and were relegated from the 2009 Thai Premier League . Despite having two of the three top goalscorers in the 2010 Thai Division 1 League , Chula could not bounce back at the first attempt and slumped to a disappointing 10th–placed finish. Chula's striker Chainarong Tathong topped the 2010 Thai Division 1 League goalscoring chart with an impressive 19 goals. Fellow frontman Aron da Silva netted 15 times to be the 3rd top scorer in the league. Big Bang Chula United In January 2011, the club changed its name to \"Big Bang Chula United\" and relocated to play their home games at the Thai Army Sports Stadium on Vibhavadi Rangsit Road . The club got off to a flying start and won promotion despite stuttering in the latter weeks of the season. The club's venture in the 2012 Thai Premier League ended with them being relegated after only one season. Home games were played at the sparsely filled 65,000 Rajamangala Stadium with an average home attendance of only 939. In April",

      "text": "William McCourty (1888 – 10 December 1917) was an English professional footballer who played in the Football League for Birmingham . Life and career McCourty was born in late 1888 in Carlisle , Cumberland , to Scottish parents, John McCourty, who worked as a joiner, and his wife, Agnes. At the time of the 1901 Census, the 12-year-old McCourty was working as a draper's errand boy to help his two older brothers support their widowed mother and four younger siblings. He went on to work as a coal miner, and played minor football for North Seaton in the Wansbeck League before a trial with Football League Second Division club Birmingham led to a contract. Commenting on one of the pre-season practice matches – a fund-raiser for the Birmingham Women's Hospital – the Birmingham Gazette wrote that McCourty, playing at left half , \"was in his element. When acting in defence he was a veritable stumbling block, and well he might be, for Banks gave him a warm time. However, he acquitted himself creditably\". McCourty made his club and Football League debut on 13 September 1909, deputising for the injured Tom Daykin in a home game against Glossop which finished as a 2–2 draw. He made no more first-team appearances, and was not re-engaged at the end of the season. McCourty remained in the Birmingham area, found employment as a conductor for Birmingham Corporation Tramways , and played for its football team in the Birmingham Combination . He married Emily Brown, a cycle finisher, in 1912, and their son William Donald was born in late 1915, by which time McCourty had moved on to driving the trams. Emily's younger sister Amy married another Birmingham footballer, Alec McClure . During the First World War , McCourty initially continued as a tram driver and played football in fund-raising matches (and appeared once for Birmingham in the wartime league ). He then served as a gunner with 119th Siege Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery . He was killed in action in West Flanders on 10 December 1917, at the age of 29, and buried in Ypres Reservoir Cemetery . In November 2018, an oak tree was planted at Birmingham City's training ground in memory of McCourty and the five other Birmingham players who died serving their country during the First World War.
