      "text": "\" At Long Last Leave \" is the fourteenth episode of the twenty-third season of the American animated television series The Simpsons , and the 500th episode overall of the series. In this episode, the Simpsons discover that the inhabitants of Springfield have grown tired of them and have secretly decided to throw them out of the city. After being evicted from Springfield, the family members end up in a rugged place without rules and regulations called the Outlands. There, they briefly come across their neighbor Julian Assange , who created WikiLeaks . Assange guest-starred in the episode as himself and recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in Britain, while waiting for the results of Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority . Michael Price wrote the episode without the intention of it becoming the 500th episode and felt honored when it was selected for the milestone. Television critics have given the episode generally positive reviews, particularly praising it for a montage of the series' couch gags that was included in the opening sequence . The storyline of \"At Long Last Leave\" has, however, received criticism for being similar to the main story structure previously done in The Simpsons Movie . During its original airing on the Fox network in the United States on February 19, 2012, the episode was watched by about 5.77 million people and received a 2.6 Nielsen rating in the demographic for adults aged 18–49 . Before this broadcast, Fox promoted the 500th episode milestone by arranging an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for longest continuous television viewing. A hundred fans of The Simpsons were invited to watch a marathon of the series' episodes, starting on February 8, 2012. The record was broken 86 hours and 37 minutes later on February 12, 2012, with only two fans left watching the marathon. Plot The Simpson family is advised of a citywide nuclear safety drill and all the inhabitants of Springfield are told to stay in their basements for three hours. The family members quickly become bored in the basement and decide to leave the house and go see the empty city. As they walk through Springfield, they see an unusual number of cars parked by the City Hall. The Simpsons go in and discover that everyone in town has gathered for a secret town meeting and have voted unanimously to kick them out of Springfield forever. Mayor Quimby reveals that the city has gone bankrupt due to the constant cleaning up of the family's shenanigans over the years, ranging from Homer 's drunken antics, Bart 's various pranks, and Lisa 's environmental concerns. Marge delivers a heart-felt plea to the residents to let the Simpsons live in the one place they call home, but they refuse, with Quimby declaring her the \"worst Simpson\" for always trying to see the family in a positive light. Ned attempts to defend the Simpsons by claiming no one should be quick to judge without being judged themselves. Quimby, having anticipated this, decides",

Ned attempts to defend the Simpsons by claiming no one should be quick to judge without being judged themselves. Quimby, having anticipated this, decides to throw him out of the meeting in response. A big celebration is held by the city's population as the Simpsons are officially evicted from Springfield, which Ned and his family refuses to attend after withdrawing their objection. When the family drives out into the middle of nowhere at night with no place to stay, they come across a man who takes them to a county called the Outlands, which is a dirty, run-down place where there are no rules and regulations. The Simpsons settle in the Outlands and meet Julian Assange —their unfriendly next-door neighbor who operates the WikiLeaks Headquarters there. While the rest of the family gets used to their new home and are much happier, Marge struggles with her new life. When they confront her about it, the family realize that Marge is just homesick for Springfield and misses their former neighbors. Despite Bart's warning to stay away from Springfield, Homer sneaks her back there one night under the disguise of Mr. Burns and Smithers , and they spend the night getting drunk and subsequently having drunken sex in their old abandoned home. However, Chief Wiggum sees through their disguises, and rallies the people of Springfield to the Simpson home to capture Homer and Marge. Homer is extremely angered by this and furiously insults the residents for being jerks to them in not allowing them to see their former town. The citizens are offended by his crude nature and order for the police to shoot him in response to him insulting their town, but Marge stuns the citizens by saying to not bother doing so because she has something she would like to tell the town before she and Homer leave. Shocked by her newfound assertive personality, Wiggum, Eddie and Lou immediately lower their guns. Marge reprimands the townsfolk in Springfield for their behavior in hating her family for being who they are and exploring their interests, stating that she and Homer came back to visit their old home here because she was homesick, only to see just how disillusioned and judgmental the residents of Springfield are in not allowing her family any decency to be themselves. She announces that the residents exiling her family out of town is the best thing that happened to them, and she'd rather return to the Outlands with her loving family because they found a place to live in. She also claims the Outlands' townsfolk are much better as a community then the residents in Springfield because they encourage the Simpsons to be themselves and to explore their interest without worry of hate, judgment and resentment from others. As Marge and Homer march through the visibly disillusioned crowd and return to the Outlands, the citizens regret exiling the Simpsons and realize they must do something",

I just like knowing it's still there. ... It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate. But even after 500 episodes, it still has a little something left.\" Goodman described the couch gag as \"lovely\". Matt Roush of TV Guide wrote favorably about \"At Long Last Leave\", describing it as a \"keeper\" and highlighting the \"dazzling opening sequence\". He concluded that The Simpsons \"once again delivers the goods, proving itself to be a classic for our age and for the ages.\" Childs was less positive, writing that the episode is \"nothing special\" as \"all of the elements seem drawn from earlier stories\" and \"only a few of the jokes rise to the lowered bar of latter-day Simpsons humor.\" He added, however, that \"nothing in the episode goes outrageously wrong, either. There is little Family Guy -style stupidity and randomness, the satire is gently pointed inward, and the guest star, while splashy for his controversiality, does not hijack the plot—instead appearing for a single joke before vanishing.\" Time critic James Poniewozik commented that \"At Long Last Leave\" was an \"all right\" episode, noting that certain gags felt \"forced by the writers' room\". He added however that \"a few moments made me bark out loud and realize why I loved the show in the first place.\" References External links Wikiquote has quotations related to \"At Long Last Leave\" .

      "text": "eyebrows. Groening disliked this detail, and the lines were eventually removed. In the season seven (1995) episode \" Treehouse of Horror VI \", Bart, alongside Homer, was rendered as a three-dimensional character for the first time in the \"Homer 3 \" segment of the episode. The computer animation was provided by Pacific Data Images . In the final minute of the segment, the three-dimensional Homer transitions into a live-action setting, finding himself in real-world Los Angeles. Directed by David Mirkin , this marked the first instance of a Simpsons character appearing in the real world within the series. In \" Lisa's Wedding \" ( season six , 1995), which is set fifteen years in the future, Homer's design was modified to reflect his older age. Changes included increased weight, the removal of one hair from the top of his head, and the addition of an extra line under his eye. This older design has since been used in subsequent flashforward episodes. Voice Dan Castellaneta ( pictured in 2002 ) voices Homer. Homer's voice is provided by Dan Castellaneta . Castellaneta also voices several other characters on The Simpsons , including Grampa Simpson , Krusty the Clown , Barney Gumble , Groundskeeper Willie , Mayor Quimby , and Hans Moleman . Castellaneta, a regular cast member on The Tracey Ullman Show , had prior experience in voice-over work, which he had done in Chicago alongside his wife, Deb Lacusta . When voices were needed for The Simpsons shorts, the producers chose Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge, respectively, opting not to hire additional actors. In the shorts and the first season of the half-hour series, Homer's voice differed noticeably from its later incarnation. Initially, it was modeled as a loose impression of Walter Matthau but Castellaneta found it challenging to maintain the Matthau-inspired tone during the nine- to ten-hour recording sessions and sought a more sustainable approach. By the second and third seasons, Castellaneta had \"dropped the voice down\" and developed it into a more versatile and humorous style, enabling Homer to express a broader range of emotions. Castellaneta's natural speaking voice bears no resemblance to Homer's. To create Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest and adopts what he describes as a state of \"letting his I.Q. go\". This method has even led to ad-libs, including the famous \"S-M-R-T; I mean, S-M-A-R-T!\" line from \" Homer Goes to College \" ( season five , 1993), which stemmed from a genuine recording mistake. Castellaneta prefers to stay in character during recording sessions and visualizes scenes to deliver the appropriate vocal performance. Despite Homer's widespread fame, Castellaneta says he is rarely recognized in public—unless by an especially dedicated fan. In \" Homer's Barbershop",

      "text": "DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said in a review of the same episode that Grampa is \"always fun\" and \"it’s nice to see him in an ebullient mood, at least for a while.\" Analysis Writer David Mirkin thinks that what makes Grampa funny is that the \"boring\" and \"tedious\" things he says are \"actually funny\" in the context of the boredom and the tedium. Mirkin thinks it is hard to make a \"boring\" and \"tedious\" character, such as Grampa, funny. He believes that what ultimately makes Grampa funny is that the things he says are \"actually funny\" in the context of the boredom and the tedium. Anne-Marie Barry and Chris Yuill, the authors of the book Understanding the Sociology of Health , commented that in episodes in which Grampa appears, the comedy content is often generated by Grampa falling asleep at \"inopportune\" moments or \"embarking\" on long rambling stories about his youth. \"Instances such as these match popular stereotypes that all old people are 'demented' and in poor health,\" they wrote. Alan S. Brown and Chris Logan wrote in The Psychology of The Simpsons that Grampa has the least amount of \"power\" in the Simpson family, and that he is treated as little more than a child and is often ignored. The family frequently laughs at his \"failing\" memory and his \"ineffectual\" attempts to get what he wants. They added that Grampa is left behind, forgotten, and rarely invited to spend time with the family. The authors commented that he is \"not without influence, but he certainly does not play the traditional grandfather role in the family hierarchy.\" Brown and Logan also wrote that Grampa had a considerable influence in the formation of Homer's character, and that flashbacks in The Simpsons show what an \"angry\", \"critical\" father he was to Homer. \"He yelled, used corporal punishment, and constantly belittled Homer's attempts to have fun, date, and excel at various activities,\" they added. The authors said that Homer tries \"in vain\" to repair his relationship with Grampa and continuously seeks for his approval, but Grampa continues to be \"as critical as ever\". However, in some episodes, he does show a loving side to Homer . Such as the episode \" Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy \", he and Homer watch the farm burn, or the episode \" To Cur with Love \", where he does everything to protect Homer's dog from Mr Burns in a flashback. In his book Understanding the Psychology of Diversity , author Bruce Evan Blaine wrote that Grampa is typically portrayed as a \"doddering\", \"senile\", and \"dependent\" person who is a \"trivial\" and \"often disposable figure\" in his son's life.

      "text": "Homer Jay Simpson is the main protagonist of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons . Part of the titular family , Homer made his television debut in the short \" Good Night \" on The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening crafted and designed Homer while waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks 's office. Initially called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell , Groening instead developed a new set of characters. After two years on The Tracey Ullman Show , the Simpson family received their own series , which premiered on Fox on December 17, 1989. Homer is the patriarch of the family; he is married to Marge , with whom he has three children, Bart , Lisa , and Maggie . As the family's primary provider, Homer primarily works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant . He represents numerous American working-class stereotypes: he is overweight, balding, immature, unintelligent, outspoken, aggressive, lazy, ignorant, unprofessional, and deeply fond of beer, junk food, and television. Despite these flaws, Homer is fundamentally a kind-hearted man and fiercely protective of his family, particularly during crucial moments. In the short films and early episodes of The Simpsons , Dan Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of Walter Matthau . However, starting with the second season of the full-length series, Homer's voice transformed into a stronger tone to effectively express a wider range of emotions. Homer has also been featured in various Simpsons-related media, such as video games , The Simpsons Movie (2007), The Simpsons Ride , commercials, and comic books , and has sparked a wide array of merchandise. His iconic catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \" D'oh! \", has been recognized in linguistics, appearing in The New Oxford Dictionary of English since 1998 and the Oxford English Dictionary since 2001. Homer is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential television characters of all time and is widely recognized as an American cultural icon . In 2007, Entertainment Weekly ranked Homer ninth on their list of the \"50 Greatest TV Icons,\" and in 2010, placed him first on their list of the \"Top 100 Characters of the Past Twenty Years\". The Sunday Times referred to him as \"the greatest comic creation of [modern] time\", while TV Guide , in 2002, referred to him as the second-greatest cartoon character (after Bugs Bunny ). Castellaneta has received four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance , along with a special-achievement Annie Award . In 2000, Homer and the family were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .

The episode was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by Chris Koch . Plot Claire ( Julie Bowen ) drives Alex ( Ariel Winter ) and Haley ( Sarah Hyland ) to school and while she does, she accidentally hits Phil ( Ty Burrell ) with the car. Phil gets up and continue walking saying he is OK but Claire is determined to get a stop sign at the intersection because it is dangerous not having one. She starts petition the city and goes door-to-door to get the signatures she needs but she does not get a very positive reaction from the neighbors. She asks for her family's help but everyone is busy with their own (meaningful) things, something that causes Claire's angry reaction. Claire goes to the city councilman ( David Cross ) to discuss her proposal and everyone comes to help her after feeling guilty for not doing it from the start. Alex and Haley got the extra signatures Claire needed and Phil made a video with Luke ( Nolan Gould ) to prove that not having a stop sign to that intersection is dangerous. In the meantime, Jay ( Ed O'Neill ) is determined to help Manny ( Rico Rodriguez ) sell wrapping paper for a school fundraiser and he goes door-to-door with him to teach him how to do it. Manny, however, is not a natural salesman, and after many failed tries, he manipulates Jay to buy the wrapping paper. Meanwhile, Mitchell ( Jesse Tyler Ferguson ) tries to prove a point with Cameron ( Eric Stonestreet ). Cameron wants to cook some crepes and Mitchell tells him that he is the one who always ending up cleaning the mess in the kitchen every time Cam gets creative. Cam promises to clean up when he is done but instead of this he goes out to help Gloria ( Sofía Vergara ) who is desperate to find Stella ( Brigitte ) after losing her. Mitchell comes back home and when he sees the mess he tells Cam that he will not clean up and let him do it as he promised. Cam comes home and sees that Mitchell indeed keep his promise not to do anything, despite hoping for the opposite, and when he starts cleaning he admits that he does not like doing it and he expected Mitch to do it. Mitch is happy that he was proved right and the two of them revel in further mess-making until the doorbell rings and reveals a representative from the adoption agency coming for a home-visit. Production \"Door to Door\" was written by executive producer Bill Wrubel and was directed by Chris Koch . \"Door to Door\" was filmed between August 29 and September 1, 2011. The episode marked the first appearance of David Cross as a city councilman who becomes enemies with Claire. He will appear in a recurring role. Reception Ratings",

      "text": "Rub-A-Dub-Dub was a British television series animated by Peter Lang and Alan Rogers of the Cut-Out Animation Co. They were previously famous for Pigeon Street . The series was produced by David Yates and Joe Wolf. The title is a reference to the nursery rhyme Rub-a-dub-dub . Rub-A-Dub-Dub was animated in a similar way, yet all the characters were anthropomorphic animals. It ran in 1984, completing 25 episodes. Episode structure The episodes usually started off with the character Mother Goose and (most often) another character stood by a polka-dot patterned bathtub, with Mother Goose saying \"Rub-a-dub-dub...\" announcing that there was an item in the tub, an item that will then be relevant to the episode, e.g. \"Rub-a-dub-dub, there's a kettle in the tub...\" The line would then usually be followed up by another. In this case, the character King Crow appears at the window and says \"...And King Crow wants his tea!\" The nursery rhymes themselves, performed by Madeline Bell and John Telfer, would be dotted in amongst the humorous dialogue between the animal characters. Characters Principal characters Mother Goose : Could be considered the hostess of Rub-A-Dub-Dub. She begins every episode by saying \"Rub-a-dub-dub, there's a... in the tub.\" She is a white goose, wearing what looks to be a yellow raincoat and hat, a blue skirt beneath the coat and blue shoes. She also wears pink tights with white spots. Polly : An irritable parrot. Their gender is ambiguous, as the song \" Little Poll Parrot \" refers to them with male pronouns while the song \"Mrs. Mason Bought A Basin\" refers to them with female pronouns. They often get annoyed with various characters, such as with Mother Goose when she asks them to make King Crow's tea . In this instance, they respond \"I'm not gonna make it! Why does it always have to be me!? Humph!\" They also often appear to be on the receiving end of bad luck, such as when they set their dinner down before the television, leave to get a drink, and then find their dinner has been stolen, to which they respond: \"EH! Where did it go?!\" Polly had a red face and blue hands and legs, wore a green jumper with red sleeves and yellow shoes. King Crow : The King who is a crow. He was awfully demanding of his servants such as Polly, on whom he intrudes into their TV-watching time, saying \"Hello Polly, get me my pipe and bowl please! \" He was also awfully energetic and bounced around a lot. Like all crows, King Crow was black with a yellow beak. He wore a stereotypical King's robe and crown, black and white striped stockings and black-and-white shoes. Queen Duck : The wife of King Crow.",
