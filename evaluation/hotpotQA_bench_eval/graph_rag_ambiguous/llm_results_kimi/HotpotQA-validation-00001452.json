Relationship with the federal government In 2018 and 2019, Ford was seen as a staunch critic of the federal government of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . Ford opposed the Trudeau government's imposed carbon tax and urged voters to vote out the Trudeau-led Liberals in the 2019 federal election . However, since 2020, journalists have noted a change in Ford's attitude towards the Trudeau government, with Ford stating he was not a partisan politician in that year. In April 2020, Susan Delacourt of the Toronto Star wrote Ford \"forged an unlikely friendship\" with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland when combatting the COVID-19 pandemic ; in August of that year, Ford praised Freeland's appointment as finance minister . In March 2022, John Ibbitson of The Globe and Mail wrote that there was a \"political bromance\" between Ford and Trudeau. In October 2022, Ford said he supported the Trudeau government's invocation of the Emergencies Act in response to the Canada convoy protest . In January 2026, Ford publicly criticized a trade agreement between Prime Minister Mark Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping . He characterized the deal as a \"terrible\" and \"knee-jerk reaction,\" asserting that it was implemented without consultation with the Canadian automotive industry . Ford referred to the Chinese vehicles as \"subsidized spy cars,\" citing potential cybersecurity and national security threats . Relationships with municipal leaders Ford had a brief feud with Patrick Brown , the mayor of Brampton and former PC leader, leading to Ford cancelling the chair of Peel Region. They later made peace by 2020. Ford stated he had a positive relationship with Olivia Chow shortly after she became mayor of Toronto, after previously calling her \"an unmitigated disaster\". Ford stated in the same interview that during an election \"you throw some mud back and forth\", also highlighting that he has a \"phenomenal relationship\" with one-time political rivals Andrea Horwath and Steven Del Duca . Ford actively supported the two Toronto mayoral campaigns of his brother Rob Ford and former Toronto police chief Mark Saunders . Personal life Family Ford and his wife Karla ( née Middlebrook) have four daughters: Krista , Kayla, Kara, and Kyla. In 2018, Ford's sister-in-law, through his late brother, Rob, sued Doug and Randy for mismanagement of Rob's estate, saying their actions deprived her and her children of due compensation while overseeing business losses at Deco Labels totalling half of the company's market value. In response, Doug alleged that the claims and the lawsuit's timing in the same week as the 2018 Ontario election amounted to extortion . Ford's mother Diane died from cancer in January 2020. Health Ford became an \"ethical vegetarian \" after working in a meatpacking plant as a teenager, and while this is no",

Because Hydro One is partially owned by the Ontario government, Ontario ratepayers would also be paying the \"Parent Termination Fee\". Ford denies that he is to blame for the U.S. regulators' decision. Political patronage controversies In July 2018, Ford hired Rueben Devlin, former PC Party president and a Ford family friend, as a health-care advisor at a salary of $350,000 plus expenses, more than Ford's own salary of $208,974. In December 2018 Bob Paulson , who served as a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer for 32-years including as RCMP commissioner before retiring in 2017, called for an independent third-party inquiry into Ford's appointment in December 2018 of Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, who is a long-time friend of Ford, as the new commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police. By March 2019, Taverner had stepped down following \"months of controversy\" that \"triggered an integrity commissioner investigation\". A June 20, 2019, article in the Toronto Star said that Ford had awarded \"plum patronage posts to two political allies\". He hired Jag Badwal as Ontario's agent-general to Britain and the United States with an annual salary of $185,000. Ford named Earl Provost as Ontario's agent-general to Chicago. On June 28, 2019, Ford's chief of staff, Dean French, resigned \"amid a patronage scandal\". According to a Globe and Mail article, French resigned \"after it was revealed that two people with personal ties to [French], 26 year-old Tyler Albrecht and Taylor Shields were appointed to lucrative positions in New York and London. The Toronto Sun reported in a June 27, 2019, article that 26-year-old Tyler Albrecht, who had a \"thin resume\", was proposed for a \"job that paid $165,000 a year, plus housing and other expenses\" as Ontario's \"new trade rep in New York City\". His qualification was \"that he played lacrosse with French's son\". TVO's Steve Paikin cited the example of Taylor Shields, who is French's wife's cousin, who was appointed as the trade representative in London, England, with a salary of $185,000 plus expenses. Just hours before French resigned, Ford had cancelled Albrecht's and Shields' appointments. Thomas Staples, who played on St. Michael's College Varsity Lacrosse team with French as coach, worked in the office of Bill Walker , who was chief government whip . When Walker became minister of government and consumer services in November 2018, Staples worked as his executive assistant and legislative affairs advisor.

According to Paikin, Pal was well qualified to be Public Accounts Council but she resigned because of the bad optics. On July 4, Peter Fenwick, who served as Ontario's first \"strategic transformation adviser\" since November 2018, was fired when it was revealed in an interview with The Star that \"Fenwick has been a life insurance customer of French's for at least 20 years\". On July 10, Andrew Suboch, a \"personal injury and insurance lawyer\" who had served as chair of the Justices of the Peace Appointments Advisory Committee (JPAAC), informed the JPAAC that he was resigning immediately after an article in the Globe revealed that Suboch was another of French's \"long-time\" friends whose sons played lacrosse together for many years. Ontario Place and Ontario Science Centre controversy In 2021, Ford released his vision for Ontario Place . This park used to be an amusement park before being shut down in 2011, and was due to be revitalized. Ford's revitalization plan included a new spa, adventure park, and expanded stage. However, an auditor general report released in December 2024 called the revitalization 'not fair, transparent or accountable,' noting that \"since 2019, the estimated public cost of redeveloping Ontario Place has increased by $1.8 billion to a total of $2.2 billion.\" The private spa is to be built and operated by Therme , an Austrian spa company. Its construction requires the clear-cutting of Ontario Place's West Island, a process which has bulldozed over 850 trees. The Ontario government is also obligated to build a substantial parking component for the spa at taxpayers' expense (even as an expanded GO train station and a new subway line are being built nearby). The cost to provide this parking is at $400 million as of May 2024. Per the auditor general report, other bids would have privately funded this parking, with 3 of the 10 bids also providing a public park as well as the funding the parking lot. The auditor general also raised concerns the bidding process for Ontario Place fell short of “typical procurement law or directives” for the province, with the government giving itself the right to select bids that failed to meet its own criteria. In 2024, the Ontario government closed down the Ontario Science Centre due to a report suggesting that the roof tiles of the science centre could collapse without repairs. However, the company that originally built the science centre said that the building does not need to be shut down, and offered to fix",

The aircraft was also given an updated livery, with the most noticeable change being a US flag on the tail in place of the original 'T'. It was recommissioned and flown to West Palm Beach, Florida, in October 2022. The aircraft appeared prominently on television on April 4, 2023, when it took Trump to LaGuardia Airport , New York, for his arraignment in a Manhattan criminal court. Similarly, Trump used the plane to fly to Miami in June 2023 when he was arraigned in federal court , in August 2023 to fly from Newark Liberty International Airport to Washington D.C. for a separate federal arraignment in relation to the 2020 election . While taxiing at the Palm Beach International Airport during the early hours of May 12, 2024, the plane clipped an unoccupied parked corporate jet. On August 9, 2024, while en route to Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport for a rally and fundraising stop in Bozeman, Montana , the plane was diverted to Billings Logan International Airport due to a mechanical issue. Other aircraft Trump Organization Cessna 750 When Trump visited Trump Tower in Manhattan in March 2021, he used the Trump Organization's 1997 Cessna 750 Citation X , N725DT. The Citation X became Trump's main jet after his first presidency, while his 757 was being renovated. The plane seats eight passengers and has a cabin height of 5 feet 7 inches (170 centimeters). When first purchased, it was the fastest business jet in the world. The Federal Aviation Administration reportedly cited the plane in 2016 when the Trump Organization did not renew its registration. In May 2024, the Trump Organization sold the Cessna to a Texan company, MM Fleet Holdings LLC, for an undisclosed amount. The fair market value of the plane was estimated at $10 million. The Trump Organization's fleet also has three Sikorsky S-76 helicopters. While the Boeing 757 was grounded for mechanical issues in August 2024, Trump attended campaign events in a Gulfstream G550 leased from Threshold Aviation Group that had previously been owned by Jeffrey Epstein . In July 2024, Trump's presidential campaign began chartering N917XA, a Boeing 737-800 operated by Eastern Air Express The plane was primarily used by his running mate, JD Vance .

Education The government of Montenegro provides Albanian-language education in the local primary and secondary schools. There is one department in the University of Montenegro , located in Podgorica , offered in Albanian, namely teacher education . Politics Early 20th century political figures which had significant activity in the Albanian community in Montenegro are Ismail Nikoçi , mayor of Gusinje and Agan Koja , imam of Plav. Nikoçi fought against the annexation of Plav-Gusinje by Yugoslavia in 1919 raised awareness for the rights of the Albanian refugees which left the area. Koja who became more prominent after Nikoçi's assassination led a group of kachaks who fought against the Yugoslav army in the Albanian-Yugoslav borderlands.

Gold was a talk radio host from the mid-1970s, and one of the first U.S. conservative talk radio hosts.  His philosophy was characterized as in the conservative- libertarian vein. Broadcasting career Gold worked as a local talk host in markets such as Boston , Denver , Tampa , Miami and Dallas . Gold began his career at KWBZ Radio in Denver, a powerful talk radio station the country's 22nd largest radio market, where he worked alongside legendary host Alan Berg . Then, during the mid-1980s, Gold moved to Tampa , Florida, where he became that city's first conservative talk host on WPLP-AM. Gold then moved to Miami to do a talk show before heading west to Dallas , where he would find the most success hosting local talk radio programs. Along with his friend Kevin McCarthy , Gold was one of the top hosts at KLIF , the first full-time talk radio station in the fifth-biggest U.S. radio market. Unusual for a radio station, the station became prominent in the city's mediascape. Its hosts were often quoted in local media and amongst local politicians. Gold was a staple at KLIF, where he ruled the afternoon \" drive time \" show from 1986 to 1997. Later radio work Gold most recently hosted an afternoon show at KSFO in San Francisco . His voice was often heard as a fill-in host at stations in markets such as Tampa and Seattle . Other media work Gold was asked to present his opinion as a guest on numerous programs including Nightline , Crossfire and Good Morning America . Gold co-hosted a weekly debate on the Dallas NBC Affiliate, KXAS-TV . Quotes One Dallas publication described Gold's influence in Dallas media: Best known was David Gold, the 3 p.m.-to-6 p.m. local Limbaugh before Limbaugh was cool, a huge talent who infuriated and captivated, such as in his first week when he suggested putting all death row inmates in the Texas Stadium end zone, wiring them, then frying them.

Gold later hosted shows at KSFO San Francisco and frequently guested on national TV programs; his provocative style and outspoken commentary made him a forerunner to later conservative hosts like Rush Limbaugh.\n\n**Keywords**: conservative talk radio, KLIF Dallas, drive-time host, libertarian commentary, media influence",

Over 400 mostly non-Afghan Taliban fighters, inadequately searched after surrendering, seized the fort’s armory and mounted a fierce, well-coordinated uprising against Northern Alliance guards and two CIA interrogators, killing officer Johnny Micheal Spann—the first U.S. combat death of the war. Northern Alliance troops, reinforced by British and U.S. special-operations teams, responded with armor, close-air support, and ultimately flooded the basement where hold-outs had barricaded themselves. By 1 December only 86 of the original 400+ prisoners survived; among them was American John Walker Lindh. The engagement became one of the bloodiest episodes of the early Afghan conflict and highlighted the risks of handling large numbers of unscreened foreign fighters.\n\n**Keywords**: Qala-i-Jangi, prisoner uprising, Johnny Micheal Spann, John Walker Lindh, 2001 Afghanistan war",
