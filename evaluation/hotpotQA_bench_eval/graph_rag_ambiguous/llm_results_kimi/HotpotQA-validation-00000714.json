Cher has starred in various international television commercials, as well as high-profile print advertising for Lori Davis (1992). Before she started her film career, she had a couple of hits in the 1960s, as a solo artist, and with her ex-husband Sonny Bono as the couple Sonny & Cher .

Since then she has starred in numerous independent and Hollywood motion pictures. She made her Broadway debut in Robert Altman 's Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean in 1982. The play was a critical and commercial success and Cher received strong reviews for her stage work (even Frank Rich called her \"ingratiating\" ) and paved the way for her to be cast in the film version the next year, that garnered her a Golden Globe nomination. She was next cast alongside Meryl Streep and Kurt Russell in the critically hailed drama Silkwood (1983) directed by Mike Nichols , inspired by the true-life story of Karen Silkwood , in which her character was a lesbian who worked at the Kerr-McGee plant in Cimarron, Oklahoma .

Plot Loretta Castorini, an Italian-American widow, works as a bookkeeper and lives in Brooklyn Heights with her parents, Cosmo and Rose, and her paternal grandfather. Loretta's boyfriend, Johnny Cammareri, proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to tend to his dying mother. Loretta accepts, but she insists on carefully following tradition as she believes failing to do so originally led to her first husband's sudden death after two years of marriage. Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny to the wedding; Ronny and Johnny have not spoken in five years. Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement. Cosmo, who runs a successful plumbing business, dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to pay for Loretta's planned \"real\" wedding. Hearing that Loretta likes but does not love Johnny, Rose tells her that true love can cause romantic partners to be easily hurt by each other. Loretta goes to see Ronny at the bakery he owns and learns Ronny has a wooden prosthetic hand caused by absentmindedly putting his hand in a bread slicer while having a conversation with Johnny; Ronny's fiancée subsequently left him. Loretta insists that they talk privately. They go to Ronny's apartment, where Loretta cooks a meal, and both have several alcoholic beverages.

Disguised as “Pauletta,” she falls in love but ultimately confesses her past; fearing scandal, she abandons Ruggero and returns to her old life, likened to a swallow flying back to its nest. The work exists in three versions with alternate endings—ranging from Magda’s solitary departure to Ruggero’s rejection upon learning her identity—and has enjoyed a modern revival since the 1990s after decades of neglect.\n\n**Keywords**: Puccini, La Rondine, Magda, Ruggero, opera revisions",
