  "llm_answer": "The amphibious assault to recapture Guam—the largest island in the Mariana archipelago administered as a U.S. territory—occurred from 21 July to 10 August 1944, whereas the fierce urban combat in Manila, the Philippine capital, took place from 3 February to 3 March 1945. Therefore, the Guam assault came earlier.",

      "text": "The Battle of Manila ( 3 February – 3 March 1945) was a major battle during the Philippine campaign of 1944–45 , during the Second World War . It was fought by forces from both the United States and the Philippines against Japanese troops in Manila , the capital city of the Philippines. The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of at least 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting fought by American forces in the Pacific theater . During the battle, Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians, while American firepower also killed many people. The fierce resistance of Japanese troops entrenched in many of the city's landmarks, along with the usage of massed artillery barrages by American forces to dislodge them, destroyed much of Manila's architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's founding. Often referred to as \"the Stalingrad of Asia\", the battle is widely considered to be one of the most destructive urban battles ever fought, as well as the single largest urban battle ever fought by American forces. The battle caused Manila to become one of the most devastated capital cities of the Second World War, alongside Berlin and Warsaw . The Allied victory contributed greatly to ending almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines (1942–1945). Manila's capture was seen as General Douglas MacArthur 's key to victory in the campaign to liberate the islands, although heavy fighting would continue on in Luzon (and elsewhere in the Philippines) until the end of the war in August 1945. It is, to date, the last battle fought within Manila . Background The first wave of American troops approaching the beaches of Luzon, January 9, 1945 On 9 January 1945, the Sixth U.S. Army under Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger made an amphibious landing at Lingayen Gulf and began a rapid drive south as part of the Battle of Luzon . On 12 January, MacArthur ordered Krueger to advance swiftly to Manila. The 37th Infantry Division , under the command of Major Gen. Robert S. Beightler , spearheaded the American push south. After landing at San Fabian on 27 January, the 1st Cavalry Division , under the command of Major Gen. Verne D. Mudge, received orders from MacArthur to \"Get to Manila! Free the internees at Santo Tomas. Take Malacanang Palace and the Legislative Building .\" On 31 January, the Eighth United States Army of Lt. Gen. Robert L. Eichelberger , including the 187th and 188th Glider Infantry Regiments of Col. Robert H. Soule and components of the U.S. 11th Airborne Division under Maj. Gen. Joseph Swing , landed unopposed at Nasugbu in southern Luzon and began moving north toward Manila. Meanwhile, the",

      "text": "Map of the battle The Battle of Guam (21 July – 10 August 1944) was the American recapture of the Japanese-held island of Guam , an American territory in the Mariana Islands captured by the Japanese in the First Battle of Guam in 1941 during the Pacific campaign of World War II . The battle was a critical component of Operation Forager . The recapture of Guam and the broader Mariana and Palau Islands campaign resulted in the destruction of much of Japan's naval air power and allowed the United States to establish large airbases from which it could bomb the Japanese home islands with its new strategic bomber , the Boeing B-29 Superfortress . The invasion of Saipan was scheduled for 15 June 1944, with landings on Guam tentatively set for just three days later, but the Battle of the Philippine Sea and stubborn resistance by the unexpectedly large Japanese garrison on Saipan led to the invasion of Guam being postponed for over a month. On 21 July, American forces landed on both sides of the Orote Peninsula on the western side of Guam, planning to secure Apra Harbor . The 3rd Marine Division landed at Asan near Agana to the north of Orote, and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed near Agat to the south. The Marines at the two beachheads were pinned down by heavy Japanese fire, making initial progress inland quite slow. Supply was very difficult; landing ships could not come closer than the reef, several hundred yards from the beach, and amphibious vehicles were scarce. The 1st Provisional Brigade blocked off the Orote Peninsula on 25 July, and that night the Japanese counterattacked , in coordination with an attack against the 3rd Marine Division to the north. The effort was a failure. On 28 July the two beachheads were linked, and by 29 July the Americans had secured the Orote peninsula. The Japanese counterattacks against the beachheads and the fierce fighting beforehand had exhausted them. By the start of August, they were running out of food and ammunition, and they had only a handful of tanks left. They withdrew from southern Guam, planning to make a stand in the mountainous central and northern part of the island, and to engage in a delaying action. The Marines and the Army's 77th Infantry Division overran the rest of the island. Rain and thick jungle made conditions difficult for the Americans, but after an engagement with the main Japanese line of defense around Mount Barrigada from 2 to 4 August, the Japanese line collapsed. On 10 August organized Japanese resistance ended, and Guam was declared secure, but 7,500 Japanese soldiers were estimated to still be at large.

      "text": "Japanese soldiers were estimated to still be at large. Geography Guam , at 225 square miles (580 km 2 ), is the largest of the Mariana Islands , larger than the other fourteen major islands combined. It is 32 miles (51 km) long from north to south, with a width ranging from 4 to 10 miles (6.4 to 16.1 km) at different points of the island. Along with the other Mariana Islands, Guam was claimed for Spain by Miguel López de Legazpi on 26 January 1565. It became a United States possession after its capture from Spain in June 1898 during the Spanish-American War . Two months later, Spain ceded Guam and the Philippines to the United States for $20 million (equivalent to about $800 million in 2024), and the island became an unincorporated territory . The island was captured by the Japanese on 10 December 1941, following the attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II . The island is surrounded by coral reefs varying from 20 to 700 yards (18 to 640 m) wide. The northern coastline is fringed with 100-to-600-foot (30 to 183 m) cliffs . Beyond is a limestone plateau, broken up by three hills, Mounts Barrigada, Santa Rosa and Machanao. The southern part of the island is also fringed with reefs and cliffs, but there are breaks in the reefs and the cliffs are lower. The highest peak is Mount Lamlam near the south west coast. Running north of it are Mount Alifan , Tenjo, Chachao and Aluyom. The best beaches lie in between, around Apra Harbor and Agat Bay . Before the war, the harbor was used by United States Navy and PanAm seaplanes; there were no airfields before the Japanese occupation. The Japanese built a 4,500-foot (1,400 m) airfield on the Orote Peninsula , and a 5,000-foot (1,500 m) airfield east of the capital Agana was nearing completion in July 1944. Work on a third airfield at Dededo had not progressed any further than the area being cleared and staked out. The average temperature was about 87 °F (31 °C) and humidity was 90 percent, with daily rainfall during the rainy season that usually ran from July to November. In these months, the unpaved roads became all but impassable. Typhoons were not an annual occurrence, but could be devastating; a typhoon in 1900 destroyed most of the crops on the island, and Guam had not fully recovered from a typhoon in 1940 . The population of Guam in 1941 was about 23,400, of whom 21,500 were Chamorro people , the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands, who were",

Lagos is indigenous to the Yoruba people , and the Yoruba language is widely spoken. It is, by most estimates, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Lagos is experiencing a population increase of about 275,000 persons per annum due to the influx of people from other regions for economic purposes. In 1999, the United Nations predicted that the city's metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000 inhabitants in 1950, would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most populous cities in the world.  Geography Map of Lagos's initial city boundaries, showing its contemporary districts. This definition is rarely used nowadays; the expanded metropolitan area is now a more accepted definition of Lagos. Satellite image of Lagos Lagos is loosely classified into two main geographical areas—the \"Island\" and the \"Mainland\".  Cityscape The city of Lagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria. The architectural styles in Lagos are diverse, ranging from tropical and vernacular to colonial European and ultramodern buildings, or a mixture. Brazilian-style architecture brought by the creoles is evident in buildings such as Water House and Shitta Bey Mosque. Skyscrapers and most high-rise buildings are centered on the islands, while the mainland has some high-rise buildings. In recent years, the Lagos State government has renovated existing parks and green areas, with a long-term goal of expansion. Many good quality buildings are interspersed across the city. Island The Island is a loose geographical term that is used to define the area of Lagos that is separated from the \"Mainland\" by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic Ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks and are connected by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events take place, as well as where most of the upscale residential areas are concentrated. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be on the Island include Lagos Island and Eti-Osa . The major upscale Island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include Ikoyi and Victoria Island . Three major bridges join the Island to the Mainland. They are the Carter Bridge , which starts from Iddo; the Eko Bridge (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the Third Mainland Bridge , which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.

The Spanish police series La unidad (2020–2023), the British drama The last tree (2019) and the US-Spanish drama The Way, Chapter 2 with Martin Sheen (2023 still in development) also use Lagos as a filming location. The film 93 Days with Danny Glover is a somewhat melodramatic but fact-based account of the Ebola outbreak in Lagos in 2014 and was filmed at original locations. Since the success of the Nigerian thriller The Figurine , Nigerian film has increasingly focused on high-quality productions that are also commercially successful. This, in turn, has led to ever-new records in box office takings in Nigeria (2009: \"The Figurine\", 2013: \"Half of a Yellow Sun\", 2016: \"The Wedding Party\"). . Sports National Stadium Association football is Lagos's most popular sport. Prominent Lagos football clubs include Bridge Boys F.C. , MFM F.C. , and First Bank : both play in Nigeria National League , the second tier of Nigerian football. The Nigeria national football team , also known as the Super Eagles, used to play almost all of their home games in Lagos at the National Stadium in Surulere; much later, games were played at the then New Abuja National Stadium in Abuja for some time; however, games are now mostly played at the newer Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, which is the default home of the Super Eagles. Lagos also hosted the 2nd All-African Games in 1973. Quality of life In a 2018 ranking of cities by quality of life, Lagos ranked 218th among 241 cities surveyed worldwide. In 2023, Lagos ranked second only to Manila in a global survey by the Statista Research Department of cities with the lowest quality of life. The quality of life index value determined is made up of eight sub-indices. By way of qualification, it must be made clear that index lists of countries or cities are usually not based on verifiable or locally collected data, but often on subjective assessments by Europeans or North Americans. The CPI of Transparency International , for example, is, according to its own definition, \"based on the perceived assessment of lay people and experts and is not reduced to actual experience and its analysis\" . There is criticism that the indices determined simply reflect the prejudices of Western countries numerically. Social situation, informal economy There is a huge spectrum of wealth distribution among the people that reside in Lagos. It ranges from the very wealthy to the very poor.

Agat Invasion Beach, 21 July 1944 By nightfall, the Marines and soldiers had established beachheads about 1,300 to 2,300 yards (1,200 to 2,100 m) deep. The brigade command post opened 200 yards (180 m) southeast of Gaan Point at 13:50, and Shepherd assumed command ashore. He organized a defense in depth against the Japanese counterattack he was certain would come during the night. Both the brigade's pack howitzer battalions were in position and registered before dark, having been brought ashore by DUKWs. The DUKWs were then used to fetch ammunition. One battery of the 305th Field Artillery arrived after dark. At 18:30, Shepherd reported to Geiger: Own casualties about 350. Enemy unknown. Critical shortages fuel and ammunition all types. Think we can handle it. Will continue as planned tomorrow. Supply was difficult. Landing ships could not come closer than the reef, several hundred yards from the beach, and the loss of twenty-four LVTs was sorely felt. A layer of silt on the shore side of the reef caused DUKWs and LVTs to become bogged. Rubber raft causeways and ships' life rafts were used as expedients to get the needed supplies ashore. Cranes were used to shift supplies in cargo nets from landing craft to the LVTs and DUKWs. Unlike the northern beaches, where some cranes were set up on the reef, all the cranes on the southern beaches had to be barge mounted, with cargo transferred in deep water. The Navy assisted by continuing unloading operations through the night. About one-fifth of the total strength of III Amphibious Corps was engaged in unloading activities. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade had 1,070 personnel on board ship and 1,800 on the reef and beaches engaged in unloading work. The 77th Infantry Division, with three battalions of shore party engineers and 270 garrison troops with low landing priorities, had 583 soldiers unloading ships and 1,828 working ashore. Potential supply dump locations identified beforehand from aerial photos were often found to be rice paddies, which were unsuitable. 155mm guns of A Battery, 7th 155mm Gun Battalion, are set up 500 yards in from White Beach Two.

Reifsnider recommended they come in around the noon half tide, when the water was waist deep, although this precluded an early relief of the Marines. The 3rd Battalion, 306th Infantry , began coming ashore at 11:30 on 23 July, followed by the rest of the regiment in the afternoon. Most of the radio sets were ruined by contact with salt water, many vehicles drowned and had to be dragged ashore by bulldozers, and a tank disappeared into a large shell hole. At 08:00 on 24 July, the 77th Infantry Division assumed responsibility for the defense of the beachhead east of the Old Agat Road. Its third regiment, the 307th Infantry , started wading ashore at 13:00 in heavy swells whipped up by a storm out to sea. Smouldering Japanese tanks knocked out on the Agat-Sumay road by U.S. Medium tanks A tank dozer and tank crews of the 22nd Tank Company with picks and shovels constructed a causeway over the Ayuja River, allowing tanks to cross, but when the 22nd Marines attempted to advance across the rice paddies at the base of the Orote Peninsula on 23 July they were pinned down under mortar and small arms fire. Tanks became bogged in the soft mud of the rice paddies, but when they tried to use the road, one was disabled by 37 mm anti-tank gun fire and another by a mine. The attack was resumed at 10:00 the next day after an intense aerial, artillery and naval bombardment. Five Japanese tanks attempted to counterattack but they were engaged and knocked out by Shermans. Another three Japanese tanks were destroyed by fighter bombers. The Shermans turned their guns on Japanese concrete emplacements and coconut bunkers. Concealed Japanese guns on the Orote Peninsula cliffs near Neye Island were engaged by USS LCI(G)-366 and LCI(G)-429 ; five sailors were killed and 26 wounded from their crews before the Japanese guns were silenced. In the afternoon, the 22nd Marines overran a series of abandoned dumps and positions and took the village of Atantano, thereby cutting off the Orote Peninsula. The cost of the first days' fighting in the southern beachhead was high, but not nearly as high as in the north.

      "text": "Lagos ( / ˈ l eɪ ɡ ɒ s / LAY -goss ; Yoruba : Èkó [èkó] ), or Lagos City , is a large metropolitan port city in southwestern Nigeria . As of November 2025 [update] , the size of the city's population has been estimated to stand between 17 and 21 million residents, making Lagos the largest city in Nigeria, the most populous urban area on the African continent, and one of the fastest-growing megacities in the world. Lagos was the national capital of Nigeria until the government 's December 1991 decision to relocate its capital to Abuja , in the centre of the country. Apart from serving as a major African financial center , Lagos has also played a significant role in the national economy, serving as the economic hub of Lagos State and the entire country of Nigeria. The city has a significant influence on commerce , entertainment , technology , education , politics , tourism , art , and fashion in Africa. Lagos is also among the top ten of the world's fastest-growing cities and urban areas. A megacity, it has the second-highest GDP in Africa, and houses one of the largest and busiest seaports on the continent. Due to the large urban population and port traffic volumes, Lagos is classified as a Medium-Port Megacity. Lagos emerged as a home to the Awori people , an Ijebu subgroup of the Yoruba of West Africa , in the 15th century, which is contained across the present-day Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) of Lagos Island , Eti-Osa , Amuwo-Odofin , and Apapa . Before the 15th century, the Awori settled on a farmstead along the coastal line, in and around which they worked and lived. Farmstead translates to Ereko in Yoruba, from which comes the Lagos indigenous name Eko . The lands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon , while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach , which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanisation, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present-day Lagos Mainland , Ajeromi-Ifelodun , and Surulere . This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island , which was the original city of Lagos, and the Mainland , which it has since expanded into. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present-day seven Local Government Areas (LGAs), and the addition of other towns (which now make up 13 LGAs) from the then Western Region to form the",

The battle took place from 25 November to 1 December, in northern Afghanistan. It followed the intervention by United States-led coalition forces to overthrow the Taliban 's Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan , which had been harboring al-Qaeda operatives. More than 400 foreign fighters surrendered outside Mazar-i-Sharif and were held at Qala-i-Jangi fortress by the Afghan Northern Alliance forces, where they were interrogated by the anti-Taliban warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum 's fighters and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel hunting al-Qaeda suspects. The prisoners, who had not been searched properly when they surrendered, violently revolted and the ensuing fighting escalated into one of the bloodiest engagements of the conflict . It took Northern Alliance fighters, assisted by British and American special forces and air support, six days to quell the revolt. All but 86 of the prisoners were killed as well as a number of Northern Alliance fighters. The only U.S. fatality was the CIA officer Johnny Micheal Spann , the first American to be killed in combat during the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan . Among the surviving prisoners were two American citizens suspected of fighting with the Taliban: Yaser Esam Hamdi and John Walker Lindh . Five American troops were wounded at Qala-i-Jangi on November 26, 2001, and were awarded the first Purple Hearts of the Afghanistan war. Navy SEALs Master Chief Petty Officer Stephen R. Bass was awarded a Navy Cross and Green Beret Major Mark Mitchell was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for actions during the battle. The CIA agent, David N. Tyson, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Cross and Spann was awarded a posthumous Intelligence Star . SBS members, Captain Jess and Corporal Tony, were awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross . Background In late November 2001, Taliban commanders, facing defeat in northern Afghanistan, agreed to surrender to the Northern Alliance warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum , leader of the ethnic-Uzbek dominated National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan , outside the besieged city of Kunduz . The surrender was negotiated at Qala-i-Jangi on November 21 between Dostum and Taliban commanders Mullah Mohammed Fazl and Mullah Norullah Noori . At 03:00 on November 24, more than 400 Al Ansar \"guest\" foreign fighters (mostly from Arabic-speaking countries of the Middle East) also surrendered their weapons, including a large group that had arrived in a convoy one day earlier to a place 100 kilometres (62 mi) away from the agreed capitulation site, close to",

The naval staff in Japan agreed to Iwabuchi's scheme, subverting Yamashita's attempts to confront the Americans with a concerted, unified defense. Iwabuchi had 12,500 men under his command, designated as the Manila Naval Defense Force, augmented by 4,500 IJA personnel under Col. Katsuzo Noguchi and Capt. Saburo Abe. These units built extensive defensive positions in the city, including inside the 16th-century fortress of Intramuros , cut down the palm trees on Dewey Blvd. to form a runway, and set up barricades across major streets. Iwabuchi split his command into a Northern Force under Noguchi and a Southern Force under Capt. Takusue Furuse. Iwabuchi had been in command of the battleship Kirishima and survived when she was sunk by American forces off Guadalcanal in 1942, which was perceived as a stain on his honor as an officer and may have motivated him to fight to the death. Before the battle began, he issued an address to his men: We are very glad and grateful for the opportunity of being able to serve our country in this epic battle.

U.S. 1st Cavalry and 37th Infantry Divisions entered the city on 3–5 February, liberating 4,000+ civilian internees at Santo Tomas and Bilibid Prison. While MacArthur prematurely declared Manila “fallen,” bitter house-to-house combat, artillery duels, and Japanese demolition of infrastructure raged for weeks. Japanese forces, trapped and facing annihilation, perpetrated systematic massacres of Filipino civilians in churches, hospitals, and schools, killing over 100,000 and reducing much of the historic capital to rubble before the last defenders were eliminated.\n\n**Keywords**: Manila 1945, Santo Tomas liberation, Japanese massacres, urban warfare, Pacific War",

Japanese massacres, American artillery bombardment, and house-to-house fighting obliterated the city’s Spanish-colonial and early-American architectural heritage, with only two buildings in the business district surviving intact. After the Japanese garrison ignored orders to withdraw, U.S. troops systematically reduced strongholds such as Intramuros, Rizal Stadium, and Fort San Antonio Abad, counting 16,665 Japanese dead inside the Walled City alone. The battle’s aftermath saw General Yamashita executed for war crimes and Manila’s transformation from the “Pearl of the Orient” to a modernist American-style capital.

Over 400 mostly non-Afghan Taliban fighters, inadequately searched after surrendering, seized the fort’s armory and mounted a fierce, well-coordinated uprising against Northern Alliance guards and two CIA interrogators, killing officer Johnny Micheal Spann—the first U.S. combat death of the war. Northern Alliance troops, reinforced by British and U.S. special-operations teams, responded with armor, close-air support, and ultimately flooded the basement where hold-outs had barricaded themselves. By 1 December only 86 of the original 400+ prisoners survived; among them was American John Walker Lindh. The engagement became one of the bloodiest episodes of the early Afghan conflict and highlighted the risks of handling large numbers of unscreened foreign fighters.\n\n**Keywords**: Qala-i-Jangi, prisoner uprising, Johnny Micheal Spann, John Walker Lindh, 2001 Afghanistan war",

Initial plans faced delays due to intelligence updates, and the landing on two distant beaches was later deemed a tactical error. Poor topographical intelligence led to high casualties for the 3rd Marine Division, though naval gunfire and LVTs proved effective.
