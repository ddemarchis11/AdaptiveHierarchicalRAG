A Clams Casino remix and Karl Lagerfeld-shot vinyl artwork added collector appeal, while an ice-rink music video starring Jamie Campbell Bower amplified its gothic, water-soaked aesthetic. Despite modest UK chart success, the song became the band’s highest-charting single in Australia (peaking at #3) and was later certified Gold in Britain.
