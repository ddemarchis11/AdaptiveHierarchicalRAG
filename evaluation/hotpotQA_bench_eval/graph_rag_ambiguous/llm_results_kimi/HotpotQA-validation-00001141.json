Reilly , Taron Egerton , Tori Kelly , Jennifer Saunders , Jennifer Hudson , Peter Serafinowicz and Nick Kroll . Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the film focuses on a koala named Buster Moon, a struggling theater owner who stages a singing competition in an effort to prevent his theater from entering foreclosure, as well as how the competition interferes with the personal lives of its contestants. The film features more than 60 songs from famous artists, mostly performed diegetically . It also has an original song by Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande called \" Faith \", which was nominated for a Golden Globe . Aside from these songs, Joby Talbot (Jennings’ frequent collaborator) composed the film's score. Sing first screened during the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2016, followed by its premiere at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on December 3.

He decides to hold a singing competition with a prize of $1,000, but a typo made by his elderly assistant iguana Miss Crawly adds two extra zeros to the prize money, making it $100,000. The misprinted flyers are blown out of the window by a fan before they can be proofread, and float across the city. Crowds of animals gather to audition, and Buster selects his contestants. Among them are housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita; punk-rock porcupine Ash; teenage gorilla Johnny, son of criminal gang leader Big Daddy; street musician mouse Mike; and an exuberant dancing pig named Gunter. Teenage elephant Meena fails her audition due to stage fright , Ash's self-absorbed boyfriend and co-auditionee Lance is upset to be dismissed from the contest, and Rosita is paired with Gunter for a dance routine.

On February 22, 2000, his first music CD Two Lips was published. It was followed on April 23, 2002, by his first comedy CD, I Am Not Homer , in which he and his wife perform several comedy skits. The majority of the sketches had been written and performed before the CD was recorded, and Castellaneta thought that it would be a good idea to preserve them \"since [he and Lacusta] don't perform them much anymore.\" Some came from their sketch series on a local radio station in Chicago and had to be lengthened from the \"two-minute bits\" that they were originally, while several others were stage sketches performed in a comedy club in Santa Monica . Additionally, \"Citizen Kane\", a sketch in which two people discuss the film Citizen Kane with different meanings, was something the pair had performed at an art gallery. Castellaneta noted that \"we already knew that these skits were funny, [but] some of them we polished and tightened.\" The skits were principally written by improvising from a basic point, transcribing the results, and then editing them to the finished scene. Castellaneta chose the title I Am Not Homer as a parody of Leonard Nimoy 's famous first autobiography, I Am Not Spock , as well as to show that most of the comedy featured \"is not the typical Homer comedy.\" Alongside his television and film work, Castellaneta has appeared in a number of theatrical productions.
