As a rookie, Edwards took over the starting position after an injury to incumbent starter J. P. Losman , leading Buffalo to a 5–1 start in 2008 before injuries and declining play resulted in his own demotion and eventual release from the team in 2010. He was also a member of the Jacksonville Jaguars , Oakland Raiders , Philadelphia Eagles , and Chicago Bears . Early life Edwards was a highly rated recruit from Los Gatos High School and was ranked as the number 1 pro-style quarterback by USA Today in 2001. Rivals.com rated Edwards as the number 2 pro-style quarterback and number 20 player overall in its rankings. He was recruited by Michigan , Florida , Notre Dame and Tennessee , but ultimately chose Stanford . In his junior and senior seasons at Los Gatos, he led the team to two undefeated seasons and back-to-back Central Coast Section Division III championships with a combined record of 26–0. In his senior year, he completed 154 of 213 passes for 2,535 yards, 29 touchdowns, three interceptions, and was named as a National Football Foundation Hall of Fame Scholar-Athlete for Santa Clara County.

After an impressive showing as a backup, Edwards got the start for four games, but was then sidelined with a shoulder injury for the rest of the season. In 2004, Edwards was the starter, but again suffered injuries that knocked him out of two games and kept him out of two others entirely. Edwards' best year was 2005, where he started all 11 games, completed 168 of 268 passes for 1934 yards and 17 touchdowns, leading the Cardinal to a 5–6 record. In 2006, Edwards was the starter for the first seven games, but suffered a season-ending broken foot against Arizona and relinquished the starting role to T. C. Ostrander . Despite Stanford's poor performance during his tenure as starting quarterback (the Cardinal was just 10–20 in games he started), Edwards was a highly touted quarterback prospect in the 2007 NFL draft due to his arm strength, accuracy, and intelligence. The summer before 2006, Edwards worked as a Synopsys intern. He decided to pass up a career in the electronic design automation industry for the NFL.

He was an All-American in 1970 for Grambling and was selected in the first round (5th overall pick) of the 1971 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles , the first defensive player chosen. Harris was named to the NFL All-Rookie team in 1971 and was widely regarded as one of the fastest defensive linemen in professional football before being hobbled by knee injuries. Harris spent seven seasons as a lineman in the NFL – three with the Philadelphia Eagles , two more with the Chicago Bears , and a final two years with the Seattle Seahawks . After his retirement from the NFL, Harris began a second career as a coach, leading several indoor football teams as head coach before working as a defensive assistant for the BC Lions , Ottawa Renegades , and Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Personal Richard Harris was born January 21, 1948, in Shreveport, Louisiana . He was raised in the historically segregated Moretown section of the city by his mother, Annice Harris. He was diagnosed with a fatty buildup around his heart when he was about 12 years old and advised at the time to avoid strenuous physical activity – advice which was roundly ignored. Richard was only allowed to play two years of high school football. He explained: \"My mother didn't like the game. She used to think I would get crunched by those big guys, and since I was the oldest boy, she didn't want anything happening to me.\" Telling his mother that he was out playing with friends when he was really going to football practice, Harris learned the game and began to develop his natural athletic skills, making use of his sprinter-caliber speed. His mother eventually relented to her son's desire to play football, declaring, \"If you want it that bad, go ahead.\" Initially used as a running back, Harris soon switched to defensive tackle, expressing a desire to hit opponents rather than be hit. Initially very thin at 178 pounds, Harris nevertheless made use of his superior speed and quickness in the high school game, earning the attention of college recruiters. College career Initially just 214 pounds when he reported to college, Harris played for head coach Eddie Robinson and his Grambling Tigers , filling out to become a 6'3\", 265-pound defensive lineman. Robinson enthusiastically remembered: \"He impressed us with his size and speed and quickness the first time we saw him. He could outrun most of our backs. Sometimes he'd get so worked up it was 'damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead' with him. We found out he has a temper. He is mean as hell.\" Harris was the star of a deep and talented 20-member senior class in",

He was the 28th player selected in the 1986 NFL draft , the first player drafted in the second round of a year in which there were only 27 first-round picks. His selection was controversial, as he did not score particularly well in the pre-draft combines, and there were more-heralded linebackers still on the board. Walker attended Carroll High School in Monroe, Louisiana . He was a latecomer to organized sports, not playing football until high school coaches and his older brother convinced him to join the team in his senior year of high school. A quick and aggressive player, he was a starter all four years at Jackson State University , where he also played power forward for the basketball team. In his senior year, he led the team with 131 tackles, was named to two All-American teams, and was named Southwestern Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year. While the Buccaneers staff were impressed with his raw talent and saw him as a potential Ted Hendricks -type player, the fans were critical of the selection of a player with so little training and experience. Walker started only nine games for the Buccaneers, all in 1987 . Although popular with teammates and a standout on special teams, he never worked his way into the regular lineup. Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins at one point toyed with the idea of taking advantage of his athleticism by converting him to tight end, but dropped the idea due to lack of interest from Walker. When Plan B free agency began in 1989, Walker was one of the players allowed to leave. He was signed by the New York Jets in 1989 after being left unprotected by the Buccaneers, but was cut from the Jets in training camp. He later played for the Cincinnati Rockers , Miami Hooters , and Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League .
