      "text": "upper half of first ladies by historians. Early life (1775–1788) Louisa Catherine Johnson was born in London on February 12, 1775. She was the second daughter of American merchant Joshua Johnson and Englishwoman Catherine Nuth. The Johnsons were an influential family in American politics, with Louisa's paternal uncle Thomas Johnson being one of the signers of the 1774 Continental Association. Little is known of her mother's life prior to her marriage. Louisa's parents may have only married ten years after her birth, potentially making Louisa the only first lady of the United States to be born out of wedlock. She lived a comfortable life as a child in which all of her needs were seen to. Louisa's father supported American independence , and the Johnsons left England in 1778 in response to the American Revolutionary War . They moved to Nantes , France, where they lived for the next five years. While in France, Louisa attended a Catholic boarding school . She performed well in school, becoming proficient in music and literature, and she learned to speak French fluently. She also practiced Catholicism. Such was her immersion in French that she was later forced to relearn English. She was also versed in Greek and Latin. The Johnsons lived in luxury, even when they did not have the financial means to do so. Their home in France was a mansion that came to be known as \"The Temple of Taste\". The Johnsons returned to England and settled in Tower Hill , while Louisa was placed in a London boarding school. She was teased for her French mannerisms, and the Catholicism that she had learned in France caused conflict with her Anglican religious education in England. Her self-esteem suffered, and she kept a distance from her peers. She was sent to be educated by John Hewlett , an Anglican minister and a family friend of the Johnsons. Hewlett became a strong influence on her upbringing, encouraging her intellectualism. The Johnsons suffered financially in 1788, and she was pulled out of school to be educated by a governess . Marriage (1790–1797) Portrait by Edward Savage , 1794 Johnson's father was appointed the American consul to Great Britain in 1790, and she often assisted in entertaining prominent guests. Among these guests, the Johnson daughters looked for potential suitors, as they were pressured to marry a prominent young man. John Quincy Adams became one such guest in 1795 in his capacity as an American diplomat. He began showing up each day, and only later did the Johnsons realize that he intended to court Louisa, initially believing that his interest was in her older sister Nancy. Only after he complied with a joking request to write her a romantic poem did she consider him a potential suitor. Johnson and Adams began a courtship, though it was intermittent, and they did not immediately take to one another. Both had previously expressed interest in other",

      "text": "Melania Knauss Trump (born Melanija Knavs ; April 26, 1970) is a Slovenian and American former model and the third wife of President Donald Trump . She has served as First Lady of the United States since January 2025, a role she previously held from January 2017 to January 2021. Trump is the first naturalized citizen and the first non-native English speaker to become first lady; the second foreign-born first lady, after Louisa Adams ; the second Roman Catholic first lady, after Jacqueline Kennedy ; and the second to hold the position nonconsecutively, after Frances Cleveland . Melanija Knavs was born in Yugoslavia , where she began working as a fashion model at the age of 16 while pursuing her education. She changed the spelling of her name to Melania Knauss and traveled to Paris and Milan to seek modeling work before meeting Paolo Zampolli , who hired her and sponsored her immigration to the United States in 1996. She worked as a model in Manhattan , where she began dating Donald Trump shortly after Zampolli introduced them in 1998. Trump worked to get Knauss more modeling jobs, and she supported him during his 2000 presidential campaign . They married in 2005, and the following year had a son, Barron Trump . Knauss started her own jewelry brand, Melania , in 2009. After encouraging her husband to run for president in the 2016 presidential election , Melania Trump made only rare campaign appearances, instead helping Donald with strategy. She received major press coverage during the campaign when erotic photos from her modeling years were republished, and again when a speech she gave at the 2016 Republican National Convention was found to be plagiarized from a similar speech by Michelle Obama . In the month leading up to the election, she defended her husband following the release of the Access Hollywood tape that mired his campaign in scandal. For the early months of her tenure as first lady, Trump stayed in Manhattan to allow Barron to finish school there and to renegotiate her prenuptial agreement . She performed minimal official activities after moving into the White House and held fewer events than previous first ladies. Trump faced several challenges in 2018, including allegations of extramarital affairs committed by her husband, surgery for kidney disease , and a tour of Africa that was overshadowed by scrutiny of her wardrobe and personal conduct. As first lady, Trump prioritized children's issues, launching the Be Best campaign to promote children's welfare and visiting many children's hospitals. She was also a close advisor to her husband, influencing his decisions to end the Trump administration's family separation policy and to ban fruit-flavored electronic cigarette cartridges. In the final months of her initial tenure as first lady, Trump endorsed her husband's false claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election . After leaving the White House in 2021, she largely stayed",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts after Melania. On September 17, 2025, Melania and President Trump attended a banquet hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla . The following day, she appeared alongside Catherine, Princess of Wales , at Windsor Castle 's Frogmore Gardens at an event highlighting scouting . On November 19, Melania traveled to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune with Second Lady Usha Vance to spend time with military members and their families to show appreciation for those who serve during the holiday season. Trump visited children and young adults being treated for rare and serious diseases at Children's Inn at National Institutes of Health as part of the celebrations for Valentine's Day 2026. Advocacy for children In July 2025, Melania visited patients at Children's National Hospital by bringing gifts and taking part in Independence Day activities with the children. Melania authored a letter to President Putin that President Trump hand-delivered during the August 2025 Alaska summit . The letter, published on social media, urged compassion for children affected by war and called for peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly thanked her for the gesture. In October, she announced that eight children displaced during the Russo-Ukrainian war had been reunited with their families following talks with Putin. On September 23, while attending the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly Melania announced the launch of the global coalition Fostering the Future Together, which focuses on helping children manage changes in education, innovation, and technology. On November 6, Melania was honored as Fox Nation 's \"Patriot of the Year\" for her work on children's global advocacy. She also launched a new initiative to expand resources and improve career opportunities for teenagers transitioning out of the foster care system and also provide them with scholarships and educational opportunities. Trump addressed schools across the nation on January 16, 2026, through Zoom , discussing how students can use artificial intelligence for creativity while also issuing a warning about how it could also hijack their thinking if they become too dependent on it. Influence on the president Melania reportedly influenced President Trump's policy shift on the Russo-Ukrainian war . President Trump was quoted saying \"I go home, I tell the first lady: 'I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation, ' \" Trump said. \"She said: 'Oh really? Another city was just hit. ' \" President Trump said this before laying out a 50 day deadline for a ceasefire in July 2025, marking a notably antagonistic tone in regards to Vladimir Putin .

Johnson and Adams began a courtship, though it was intermittent, and they did not immediately take to one another. Both had previously expressed interest in other potential partners. It was their talents and prestige that eventually drew them to one another. Adams in particular was taken by Johnson's aptitude for singing and music. This pairing also caused a rivalry between Louisa and her older sister, who was jealous for the man she thought would court her. Johnson and Adams were engaged by 1796, but Adams left England for work and provided a number of excuses as to why he felt they should not be wed, citing his work, his finances, and their personality conflicts. Another factor was the disapproval of his mother, Abigail Adams , who did not wish to see her son marry an Englishwoman. They communicated by letter over the following year, and Johnson came to dread their communications, as Adams's letters were humorless and chastising. Louisa and John eventually married on July 26, 1797, after pressuring from her father. Shortly after the marriage, the Johnsons lost the remainder of their fortune. Louisa's parents fled the country, leaving Louisa and John with little financial support and a mob of angry creditors. The couple disagreed about how much influence a wife should have in her family, and John often made major decisions without consulting her. Both had strong personalities, and their disagreements often became arguments. Diplomat's wife (1797–1825) Prussia John was appointed American minister to Prussia in 1797, and the couple moved to Berlin . Louisa experienced several miscarriages over the following years, causing poor health that further strained her relationship with her husband. She eventually gave birth to their first child, George Washington Adams , in 1801. She took a prominent role in diplomatic proceedings when she was not ill from pregnancy, and she was popular among the Prussian aristocracy, personally befriending the king and queen . John was recalled from Berlin by his father after Thomas Jefferson was elected president , and the family left Prussia for the United States. United States Adams reunited with her family after arriving in the United States in 1801 while her husband went to his own family home in Quincy, Massachusetts . The journey from Washington to Quincy was interrupted by an uncomfortable dinner with the Jefferson family at the White House and a visit to Martha Washington at Mount Vernon , but it was otherwise long and punishing. Reluctantly, she arrived in Quincy to meet her parents-in-law. While she quickly took to her father-in-law, her mother-in-law remained skeptical of her suitability as a wife.

The City Heiress was one of Behn's plays singled out by satirists for scorn. Referring to the epilogue , Robert Gould sarcastically asked, \"The City Heiress, by chast Sappho Writ: Where the Lewd Widow comes, with brazen Face, Just reeking from a Stallion's rank Embrace T'acquaint the Audience with her Filthy Case. Where can you find a Scene for juster Praise, In Shakespear , Johnson , or in Fletcher 's Plays?\" -- The Play-House, a Satyr Behn's play has been called \"a comedy of libertine complicity: her characters act as though they believed in order, authority, true love, and marriage even though they celebrate for the better part of five acts their license to disbelieve\". Other Restoration comedies were as frank with their sexuality, and others had women choosing their lovers on the basis of their wit (while wits choose theirs on the basis of money), but Behn's characters do not moderate their desires in their comedic solutions. Further, Treat-all's punishment is poverty and subjugation, rather than being hanged; and Wilding's goal is luxury, rather than moral justice. The distinctions are subtle, but it was not merely Behn's sex that made the play offensive to moralizing poets of the 1690s and the first decade of the 18th century.

Trump has said that she can speak English, Italian, French, and German in addition to her native Slovene, but in public she has fluently spoken only English and Slovene. Early modeling career European career Knavs was discovered by Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko when she was sixteen, after modeling in a school-sponsored show. At the time, she had wanted to be a fashion designer rather than a model. She won a modeling contest with the Italian studio Cinecittà that entitled her to a movie role, but rejected the prize after a producer sexually propositioned her. As her modeling career progressed, Knavs took on the alternate spelling of her surname as, \"Knauss\" and of her given name as \"Melania\".  She traveled in Europe to find modeling work. Except for a few close relatives, she did not maintain contact with anyone she knew in Slovenia. In 1992, she was named runner-up in the Jana Magazine Look of the Year contest, which promised its top three contestants an international modeling contract. She signed with RVR Reclame in Milan, but left the organization a few months later. Knauss spent the following years traveling in Europe for modeling jobs, including one in which she portrayed the first female president of the United States in 1993. Around age 23 or 24, she made Paris her primary residence, where she lived with her roommate Victoria Silvstedt . Knauss modeled for fashion houses in Paris and Milan, where in 1995 she met Metropolitan Models co-owner Paolo Zampolli , who was on a scouting trip in Europe. Zampolli, a friend of her future husband Donald Trump , became one of her few long-time acquaintances. Relocating to New York Zampolli urged Knauss to travel to the United States, where he said he would like to represent her. In 1996, Knauss moved to Manhattan. By this time, she was already 26 years old, much older than most aspiring models. Zampolli encouraged Knauss to live near and socialize with people in the fashion industry, and he arranged for her to share an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian in Zeckendorf Towers in Union Square . Her rent was taken from her pay with Zampolli's agency. Once she resided in the United States, she made only rare and brief visits to her country of origin. She lived a healthy lifestyle, managing her diet carefully, and avoided the drinking and partying that often consumed the lives of the models around her. She did not lead an active social life and rarely went out. Knauss was featured in a nude photo shoot for a 1997 issue of",

A warrant was issued for her arrest, but there is no evidence it was served or that she went to prison for her debt, though apocryphally it is often given as part of her history. Portrait by Mary Beale Forced by debt and her husband's death, Behn began to work for the King's Company and the Duke's Company players as a scribe. She had, however, written poetry up until this point. While she is recorded to have written before she adopted her debt, John Palmer said in a review of her works that, \"Mrs. Behn wrote for a livelihood. Playwriting was her refuge from starvation and a debtor's prison.\" The theatres that had been closed under Cromwell were now re-opening under Charles II, plays enjoying a revival. Under Charles, prevailing Puritan ethics were reversed in the fashionable society of London. The King associated with playwrights that poured scorn on marriage and the idea of consistency in love . Among the King's favourites was the Earl of Rochester John Wilmot , who became famous for his cynical libertinism. In 1613 Lady Elizabeth Cary had published The Tragedy of Miriam , in the 1650s Margaret Cavendish published two volumes of plays, and in 1663 a translation of Corneille 's Pompey by Katherine Philips was performed in Dublin and London. Women had been excluded from performing on the public stage before the English Civil War, but in Restoration England professional actresses played the women's parts. In 1668, plays by women began to be staged in London. Behn's first play The Forc'd Marriage was a romantic tragicomedy on arranged marriages and was staged by the Duke's Company in September 1670. The performance ran for six nights, which was regarded as a good run for an unknown author. Six months later Behn's play The Amorous Prince was successfully staged. Again, Behn used the play to comment on the harmful effects of arranged marriages. Behn did not hide the fact that she was a woman, instead she made a point of it. When in 1673 the Dorset Garden Theatre staged The Dutch Lover , critics sabotaged the play on the grounds that the author was a woman. Behn tackled the critics head on in Epistle to the Reader . She argued that women had been held back by their unjust exclusion from education, not their lack of ability. Critics of Behn were provided with ammunition because of her public liaison with John Hoyle , a bisexual lawyer who scandalised his contemporaries. After her third play, The Dutch Lover , failed, Behn falls off the public record for three years. It is speculated that she went travelling again, possibly in her capacity as a spy. She gradually moved towards comic works, which proved more",

She was born in England and raised in France . Her father was an influential American merchant, and she was regularly introduced to prominent Americans. After her family returned to England, she met John Quincy Adams in 1795, and the two began a tenuous courtship. They married in 1797 after being engaged for a year, beginning a marriage of disagreements and personality conflicts. She joined her husband on his diplomatic mission to Prussia , where she was popular with the Prussian court . When they returned to the United States, her husband became a senator and she gave birth to three sons. John was appointed minister to the Russian Empire in 1809, and they traveled to Russia without their two older sons, against Louisa's wishes. Though she was again popular with the court, she detested living in Russia, especially after the death of her infant daughter in 1812. She lived in Russia alone for a year while John negotiated the Treaty of Ghent , and when he asked her to join him in 1815, she made the dangerous 40-day journey across war-torn Europe. The Adamses lived in England for two years before returning to the United States when John was appointed Secretary of State . Louisa became a prominent cabinet wife and regularly hosted important guests in her home. She worked to build connections for her husband's 1824 presidential run , allowing for his victory. She was unsatisfied in the White House , where she became reclusive and grew distant from her husband. She instead took to writing, producing plays, essays, poems, and an autobiography. She wished for retirement after her husband lost re-election, but he was elected to the United States House of Representatives . She took a more active interest in politics, supporting abolitionism and greater rights for women in society. She was widowed in 1848, and she had a stroke in 1849 that left her with limited mobility. She died on May 15, 1852, at the age of 77, and Congress adjourned for her funeral, the second time a woman was honored in this way. She was the only foreign-born first lady of the United States until 2017, when Melania Trump became first lady. Her tenure as first lady is not as well studied as other parts of her life, due to her reclusiveness and the limited records she kept at the time. Still, she is generally rated in the upper half of first ladies by historians. Early life (1775–1788) Louisa Catherine Johnson was born in London on February 12, 1775.

Melania had a close, trusting relationship with her staff, and she was protective of them when conflict arose. Before moving in, Melania worked with Kannalikham to redecorate the White House, as first ladies typically do. She had most of the Obama-era decor replaced, and like the Obamas, the Trumps paid for it out of pocket instead of using the allotted funding. Life in the White House Melania Trump with Argentine first lady Juliana Awada in 2017 Melania and her son, Barron, moved into the White House on June 11, 2017. Like they had throughout their marriage, Melania and Donald chose to sleep in separate bedrooms. In her first year, Melania gave only eight speeches, compared to 74 by Michelle Obama and 42 by Laura Bush . Instead of frequent public appearances, she communicated her activities through video. Most of Melania's appearances as first lady in 2017 were in Manhattan and Washington, and she typically spoke about women's and children's issues. After moving to the White House, Melania opted to spend most of her time in the private quarters, running the White House staff from there instead of the first lady's East Wing offices. She oversaw restorations of several rooms in the building, including the bowling alley in the White House basement and the first lady's hairdresser's room. She kept one office, called the \"swag room\" by aides, in which she kept trinkets she collected while she was first lady. To accommodate Barron's soccer practice, she had a net installed on the White House grounds and had a coach practice with him. Barron remained Melania's top priority when she was first lady, and she worked to keep him free from politics to the point that staffers referred to her as \"The Protector\". Even after arriving at the White House, Melania spent extensive time away each year, visiting Mar-a-Lago on major holidays and over many weekends. Melania Trump examining the 2018 White House Christmas decorations Melania personally involved herself in decorations and planning within the White House. She was particular about how things were designed and arranged whenever events were planned, but she would take on a calm and relaxed demeanor once the event began. Whenever a foreign dignitary arrived at the White House, Melania had the Blue Room set aside where she ate lunch or drank tea with the dignitary's spouse. When choosing which presidential china set to use, Melania often chose the Clinton administration china with its gold embroidery. She held events less frequently than her predecessors, with a typical week featuring three or fewer events, all under one hour long. Among her most ambitious projects was planning the White House Christmas decorations in 2018. Moving away from traditional designs, she filled the East Colonnade with red cranberry-laden",
