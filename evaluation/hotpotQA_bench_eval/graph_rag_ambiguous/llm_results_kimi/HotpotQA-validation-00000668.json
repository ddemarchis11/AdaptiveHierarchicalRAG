      "text": "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a 2016 American epic space opera film directed by Gareth Edwards and written by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy . Produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures , it is the first Star Wars anthology film and a prequel to Star Wars (1977). It stars Felicity Jones , Diego Luna , Ben Mendelsohn , Donnie Yen , Mads Mikkelsen , Alan Tudyk , Riz Ahmed , Jiang Wen , and Forest Whitaker . Set a week before the events of Star Wars , Rogue One follows rebels who steal the schematics for the Galactic Empire 's ultimate weapon, the Death Star . It details the Rebel Alliance 's first effective victory against the Empire, as referenced in the Star Wars opening crawl . John Knoll , who served as the visual effects supervisor of the Star Wars prequel trilogy , pitched Rogue One 's story as an episode of the unproduced television series Star Wars: Underworld in 2003. He pitched it again as a film following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012; Edwards was hired to direct in 2014. Edwards sought to differentiate Rogue One from previous Star Wars films and approach it as a war film , omitting the opening crawl and transitional screen wipes used in the main \" Skywalker Saga \" installments. Principal photography began at Pinewood Studios , Buckinghamshire , in early August 2015 and wrapped in February 2016. The film went through extensive reshoots in mid-2016 . The score was composed by Michael Giacchino , rather than the Skywalker Saga composer John Williams . With an estimated production budget of $200–280.2 million, Rogue One is one of the most expensive films ever made . Rogue One: A Star Wars Story premiered in Los Angeles on December 10, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 16. It received positive reviews, with praise for its acting, story, visuals, musical score, cinematography, and darker tone than previous Star Wars films, but criticism for its pacing and digital recreations of Carrie Fisher and Peter Cushing . Rogue One grossed $1 billion worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 2016 , and received two Academy Award nominations for Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects . Andor , a prequel television series, aired on the streaming service Disney+ for two seasons from 2022 to 2025. Plot Research scientist Galen Erso and his family are in hiding on the planet Lah'mu when Imperial weapons developer Orson Krennic arrives to press him into completing the Death Star , a superweapon capable of destroying planets. Galen's wife Lyra is killed in the confrontation while their daughter Jyn escapes and is rescued by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera .

Comics Months after the film was released, Marvel Comics adapted the film into a six-part comic book miniseries, which adds extra content. In August 2017, IDW Publishing announced that it would make a one-shot graphic novel adaptation of the film, which was released one day after the Marvel miniseries' collection was released. Unlike the Marvel miniseries, this graphic novel will have slightly more cartoonish visuals. In the same month, Marvel Comics released the Star Wars: Rogue One – Cassian & K-2SO Special , a non-canon 40-page one-shot comic focusing on the first meeting between Cassian Andor and K-2SO. The comic was written by Duane Swierczynski and pencilled by Fernando Blanco. Video games A downloadable expansion pack for Star Wars Battlefront (2015), titled Rogue One: Scarif , was released in December 2016, and added content based on the film, including new game modes, a map based on the planet Scarif, and Jyn Erso and Orson Krennic as playable characters. A free virtual reality mission for PlayStation 4 was also released alongside the expansion. A Rogue One Play Set was also planned for the game Disney Infinity 3.0 as a purchasable expansion pack. However, it was scrapped alongside the cancellation of the series. A free update for Star Wars Battlefront II (2017) was released in April 2020, adding a different Scarif map and other Rogue One -inspired content. Several characters and concepts from the film were also included in the mobile games Star Wars: Force Arena , Star Wars Commander , and Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes . Release Actors Diego Luna and Felicity Jones and director Gareth Edwards appear at the Rogue One premiere in Japan . Rogue One premiered at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles on December 10, 2016. The film was released in certain European countries on December 14, 2016, in North America on December 16, and in China on January 6, 2017. Rogue One was released on Digital HD on March 24, 2017, and by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray , Blu-ray 3D , and DVD on April 4. The film made a revenue of $81.1 million with nearly 4 million units sold, making it the third best-selling title of 2017 behind Moana and Beauty and the Beast . It was also released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 31, 2020, whilst also being reissued on Blu-ray and DVD. To promote the release of Andor , Disney re-released Rogue One into over 150 IMAX theaters across the United States and Canada on August",

      "text": "was further released by Mondo in March 2022. Marketing Promotion Promotion of Rogue One was initially delayed by the release of the film Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation in July 2015, because the titles were deemed too similar. Paramount Pictures registered and cleared the title with the Motion Picture Association of America in January 2015, well before Disney announced the title of its forthcoming Star Wars spinoff. Disney and Lucasfilm had to reach an agreement with Paramount over promotion in order to avoid any confusion in the public mind. Disney agreed to embargo promotion on Rogue One until after mid-2015, with the exception of a very short teaser which was screened at Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim that year. A teaser trailer for Rogue One , released by Lucasfilm on April 7, 2016, was praised by reviewers for its portrayal of strong female characters. The Daily Telegraph described Jyn Erso 's character as \"a roguish, Han Solo -style heroine,\" calling the film \"progressive,\" while noting its painstaking faithfulness to the production design style of the original Star Wars trilogy . The Hollywood Reporter also noted the visual nods to the original trilogy, and examined the film's possible narrative direction, considering that the outcome is to some extent already revealed in the opening crawl of A New Hope . The Atlantic writer David Sims stated that the trailer brought \"back some memorable pieces of architecture, from the lumbering AT-AT walkers to the Death Star itself, not to mention the glorious 70s costuming of Star Wars .\" He added that the trailer has \"the look,\" blending the old with the new. The trailer was viewed close to 30 million times in its first 29 hours, at a rate of 800,000 views per hour, from Facebook and YouTube, which is 200,000 views short of what the first teaser trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens was receiving in November 2014. In June 2016, Rogue One was promoted at the Star Wars Celebration Europe III event in London. During the event, a new official poster was unveiled, which depicts a battle taking place on the tropical planet Scarif, with the Death Star looming large in a blue sky, above which is printed the tagline \"A Rebellion Built on Hope\". A second teaser trailer was screened exclusively at the event, and it was reviewed favorably by critics; The Daily Telegraph noted that the trailer revealed new locations such as the planets Jedha and Scarif, and that its most significant revelation came in the final seconds of the teaser, with the appearance of Darth Vader, reflected in a computer screen and accompanied by his classic breathing sound effect. Variety also hailed the Vader reveal, and noted that the emphasis of the production was much more on the kinetic depiction of large battle sequences and full-on warfare, comparing it to Francis Ford Coppola 's 1979 Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now . A showreel was also shown during the event, which featured footage from the",

Scott regarded the film as being \"mediocre\" and primarily critiqued the plot and thematic content, which he believed to be underdeveloped. Meanwhile, Brody, who went on to call it \"lobotomized and depersonalized,\" felt Edwards overlooked many aspects of Star Wars lore. Brody positively regarded Fraser's cinematography, and considered it his favorite element of the film, but was not affected by the death of major characters as he was not emotionally invested in their story. Rogue One introduced many new characters into the Star Wars mythology, with Chirrut Îmwe, played by Donnie Yen , and K-2SO, played by Alan Tudyk , being the most popular. In a poll on the official Star Wars website in May 2017, in which more than 50,000 people voted, Chirrut Îmwe was voted as the most popular Rogue One character. George Lucas was reported to have enjoyed the film more than The Force Awakens ; upon hearing this, Edwards said, \"I can die happy now.\" The film was praised for its exploration of ethics in engineering ; in a reviewer's words, \"the core ethical arc of the film is one man's decision to engineer the Death Star in such a way as to prevent its use for galactic domination. One could fairly re-title the movie to 'Rogue One: an Engineering Ethics Story.'\" James Seddon, writer for the military news website Task & Purpose lauded Rogue One as the Star Wars film that best reflects real military experience. Many details resonate with his own military service and seem real to veterans: \"The spacecraft rattle annoyingly. Places where hands would naturally grab, or gear would rub, have the paint worn off. Cockpit windows are scratched, and, if the sunlight hits them wrong, they are hard to see through. Headphones get hung on a convenient grab rail and not on the hanger designed for them—if there even was a hanger. Apparently, designers of military vehicles in galaxies far, far, away have also never actually operated them in the field.\" He also pointed to aspects beyond the film's production design, like rebel Lt. Sefla's muzzle discipline , the \"bitter stoicism\" predominant among characters who \"spend most of their time wet, uncomfortable, afraid, and bickering\" even as they work diligently to complete their mission, and the moral ambiguity of some of the rebels' actions. In 2025, it was one of the films voted for the \"Readers' Choice\" edition of The New York Times ' list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century,\" finishing at number 176.

Galen's wife Lyra is killed in the confrontation while their daughter Jyn escapes and is rescued by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera . Fifteen years later, cargo pilot Bodhi Rook defects from the Empire, taking a holographic message from Galen to Saw on the moon Jedha . Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor learns of the Death Star and Bodhi's defection from an informant at Kafrene. Jyn is freed from an Imperial labor camp on Wobani and is brought to the Rebels' base on Yavin 4 , where Rebel leader Mon Mothma convinces her to find Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the superweapon. Cassian is covertly ordered to aid Jyn but to kill Galen rather than extract him. Jyn, Cassian, and reprogrammed former Imperial droid K-2SO travel to Jedha, where the Empire loots kyber crystals to power the Death Star. In Jedha City, Saw and his partisans are engaged in an armed insurgency against the Empire, and Jyn and Cassian get caught in the crossfire. Aided by blind spiritual warrior Chirrut Îmwe and his mercenary friend Baze Malbus , Jyn makes contact with Saw, who is holding Bodhi. Saw shows her the message in which Galen reveals he has secretly built a vulnerability into the Death Star. The schematics are located in an Imperial data vault on the planet Scarif . Onboard the Death Star, Krennic orders a test-fire, which destroys Jedha City. Jyn and her group take Bodhi and flee the moon, but accidentally leave Galen's message behind. Saw chooses to stay behind and dies in the explosion. Imperial governor Grand Moff Tarkin congratulates Krennic before using Bodhi's defection as a pretext to take control of the Death Star. Bodhi leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the planet Eadu , where Cassian hesitates to kill Galen. Rebel bombers then attack the facility; Galen is wounded and dies in Jyn's arms before she escapes with her group on a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle.

The winning entrant was set on a roller coaster and was screened at Ebertfest that year. Other interests In addition to film, Ebert occasionally wrote about other topics for the Sun-Times , such as music. In 1970, Ebert wrote the first published concert review of singer-songwriter John Prine , who at the time was working as a mailman and performing at Chicago folk clubs. Ebert was a lifelong reader, and said he had \"more or less every book I have owned since I was seven, starting with Huckleberry Finn .\" Among the authors he considered indispensable were Shakespeare , Henry James , Willa Cather , Colette and Simenon . He writes of his friend William Nack : \"He approached literature like a gourmet. He relished it, savored it, inhaled it, and after memorizing it rolled it on his tongue and spoke it aloud. It was Nack who already knew in the early 1960s, when he was a very young man, that Nabokov was perhaps the supreme stylist of modern novelists. He recited to me from Lolita , and from Speak, Memory and Pnin . I was spellbound.\" Every time Ebert saw Nack, he'd ask him to recite the last lines of The Great Gatsby . Reviewing Stone Reader , he wrote: \"get me in conversation with another reader, and I'll recite titles, too. Have you ever read The Quincunx ? The Raj Quartet ? A Fine Balance ? Ever heard of that most despairing of all travel books, The Saddest Pleasure , by Moritz Thomsen? Does anybody hold up better than Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather? Know any Yeats by heart? Surely P. G. Wodehouse is as great at what he does as Shakespeare was at what he did.\" Among contemporary authors he admired Cormac McCarthy , and credited Suttree with reviving his love of reading after his illness. He also loved audiobooks , particularly praising Sean Barrett 's reading of Perfume . He was a fan of Hergé 's The Adventures of Tintin , which he read in French. Ebert first visited London in 1966 with his professor Daniel Curley , who \"started me on a lifelong practice of wandering around London. From 1966 to 2006, I visited London never less than once a year and usually more than that. Walking the city became a part of my education, and in this way I learned a little about architecture, British watercolors, music, theater and above all people. I felt",

Casting saw Felicity Jones confirmed as Jyn Erso in March 2015, with Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Riz Ahmed, and Forest Whitaker joining shortly after. Principal photography spanned Pinewood Studios and global locations such as Iceland, Jordan, and the Maldives, while post-production featured extensive reshoots directed by Gilroy and digital resurrection of Peter Cushing’s Grand Moff Tarkin.\n\n**Keywords**:  \nRogue One, casting, reshoots, Tony Gilroy, digital effects",

After an accidental murder at a convenience store, the trio become fugitives, drifting through a surreal landscape of mistaken identities, brutal assaults, and darkly comic coincidences (every purchase totals $6.66). The film culminates in a savage neo-Nazi attack that leaves Jordan mutilated and Amy seeking bloody revenge.

Albanian League fighters, notably Ali Pasha Gucia and Ded Gjo Luli, resisted cession after the Congress of Berlin, fighting key battles at Novšiće, Murino and Deçiq where the Albanian flag was re-raised in 1911. Despite uprisings, memoranda and foreign petitions, Montenegro eventually occupied the regions, carrying out massacres and forced conversions in 1912-13, while Albanian nationalists used neighboring Montenegro as a rebel base to keep the independence cause alive.  \n\n**Keywords**: Plav-Gusinje, League of Prizren, Deçiq 1911, Balkan Wars, Albanian resistance",

Critics praised its seamless editing and the rare, intimate glimpses it offers of Jackson as a perfectionist yet playful artist, while acknowledging that the absence of a true live performance leaves a bittersweet, unfinished feeling. The movie became a global home-video phenomenon, setting first-week sales records in the U.S. and Japan and ultimately moving more than 3 million units domestically. Reviewers lauded standout rehearsal moments—especially “Human Nature,” “Thriller,” and “Beat It”—but were divided on the environmental vignette in “Earth Song,” with some calling it overblown.
