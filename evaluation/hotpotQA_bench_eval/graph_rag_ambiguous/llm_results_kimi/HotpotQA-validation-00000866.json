      "text": "Marc Joseph Predka (born April 21, 1975), better known by his stage name Trademarc (formerly Tha Trademarc ), is an American rapper. He first came to prominence when he and his younger first cousin, WWE wrestler John Cena , collaborated on the 2005 album You Can't See Me , including Cena's entrance theme \" The Time Is Now \". He also appeared in the music videos of the songs, \"Bad Bad Man\" and \"Right Now\" with Cena. Prior to the album, Trademarc appeared on Cena's first WWE DVD Word Life . In August 2007, Trademarc appeared at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling 's (TNA) Hard Justice pay-per-view as the \"new boyfriend\" of Karen Angle , later revealed to be a ruse when Karen and Trademarc helped Karen's \"estranged\" husband Kurt Angle win the match. He appeared again on iMPACT! the next week. While working with TNA he also worked with Dale Oliver to re-record Kurt Angle's entrance music into the hip hop theme \"Gold Medal\", which Angle would use for the remainder of his time with the promotion.  In 2008, he released his first solo debut album Inferiority Complex . East Coast Avengers In August 2008, Tha Trademarc collaborated with Massachusetts rappers Esoteric and DC The Midi Alien to create the East Coast Avengers. Their group debut album Prison Planet was released in late 2008. The group released their song \"Kill Bill O'Reilly\" which caused a media controversy due to lyrics that centered on violently killing Bill O'Reilly . Michelle Malkin 's criticism of the song led to the group recording \"Dear Michelle\" in response. They have since released another single titled \"Hey America!\" Discography With John Cena You Can't See Me (May 10, 2005) For TNA Gold Medal (Kurt Angle’s Theme) (2007) Solo Inferiority Complex (April 4, 2008) Black Ash Days With DC the Midi Alien (May 16, 2015) Blood Meridian With Filthy Animals (November 22, 2019) With East Coast Avengers Prison Planet (October 7, 2008) Avengers Airwaves References External links Tha Trademarc (Marc Predka) at IMDb",

      "text": "Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song \" Daddy \" was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis : \"When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really like to talk about that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it...\" \"Kill You\" was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his stepmother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like \"Justin\" and \"Pretty\" written about incidents occurring during adulthood. Influences A few years before establishing Korn, James \"Munky\" Shaffer; Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu; and David Silveria (who were three members of the funk metal band L.A.P.D. ), alongside friend Brian \"Head\" Welch, all had the common influences of Red Hot Chili Peppers and especially the Faith No More album The Real Thing . Likewise, Davis was greatly inspired by the adventurousness of The Real Thing upon its 1989 release: \"It showed everybody you could do heavy music and not be 'metal'. It was something completely different.\" In the Guitar World section \"The Album that Changed My Life\" of January 1997, Welch listed The Real Thing by Faith No More as the album that changed his life, while Arvizu named both the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Freaky Styley and Faith No More's Introduce Yourself . Fieldy's biggest bass influences were Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers and Les Claypool from Primus . He was also greatly inspired by Billy Gould 's chemistry with his Faith No More bandmates and Stanley Clarke . In 2015, asked about what record has stuck with him through the years, Munky first named 1992's Angel Dust by Faith No More, followed by Evil Empire by Rage Against the Machine and The Fragile by Nine Inch Nails . For his part, David Silveria named Mike Bordin of Faith No More one of his biggest influences. Munky later acknowledged the song structures and instrumentations of Faith No More in inspiring Korn's future songwriting: \"Faith No More steered us in the direction where we ultimately ended up.\" They became \"fanatics\" of Faith No More singer Mike Patton , researched about him, and traveled to the band's hometown of San Francisco in order to watch them play. In this way, they discovered Patton's avant-garde metal band Mr. Bungle , whose 1991 self-titled album had a long-standing impact on Korn's experimentation, dissonance, and eccentric stylings. A notable example of Bungle's influence has been what Korn dubbed the \"Mr.",

The single managed to peak at number eight on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. It eventually became their first single to be certified gold in the United States. The second single, \" Narcissistic Cannibal \", was released in October 2011, with its music video being directed and produced by Alexander Bulkley of ShadowMachine Films . After a stint of festival appearances, Korn promoted The Path of Totality during a headlining tour of the same name . Korn split their show into three sections. The band kicked off by playing tracks from their first two albums, including the B-side \"Proud\", which was originally included on the soundtrack to the 1997 film I Know What You Did Last Summer . They followed with a different stage set up, playing several of their new songs. The set list ended with hit singles and an encore. Other appearances came from Datsik , Downlink, and Dope D.O.D. A special album release performance filmed and recorded at the Hollywood Palladium was issued in various formats through Shout! Factory in September 2012. The Path of Totality won Album of the Year at the 2012 Revolver Golden Gods Awards. This was Korn's first victory at the Golden Gods Awards, a ceremony that celebrates the best in hard rock and heavy metal music. Korn was also inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame during the 2011 Kerrang! Awards . On May 5, 2012, guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch joined Korn on stage at the Carolina Rebellion festival to play \"Blind\" for the first time since his departure. As recalled in the documentary DVD Reconciliation , Welch's appearance was a spur-of-the-moment decision: Welch initially visited the festival because of his daughter, who was a fan of bands performing. Welch joined Red on stage for a song, and would eventually be persuaded to join his old bandmates in Korn for a meet and greet . Upon Korn preparing for the show, the guitar tech prepared an extra guitar and amplifier for Welch, \"just in case\". On July 18, 2012, Jonathan Davis told Billboard.com that Korn was getting ready to start recording their eleventh studio album that would be released independently. It was also announced that their next album would not contain any dubstep influences like The Path of Totality . Guitarist James \"Munky\" Shaffer stated in an interview with the Phoenix New Times that the new album would be heavier, with more aggressive \"in-your-face\" guitars and vocals. He went on to say that he would be using new recording techniques in the studio to give his riffs a fresh approach. In November 2012, Mudvayne bassist Ryan Martinie",

The band felt that the electronic side of their music was becoming too dominant, and wanted to return to a simpler rock sound. After self-producing their previous two albums, the band hired producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange so they could focus on performance and spend less time mixing and reviewing takes. Recording took place in the Vancouver Warehouse Studio from October 2014 to April 2015. Muse announced their seventh album, Drones , on 11 March 2015. The following day, they released a lyric video for \" Psycho \" on their YouTube channel, and made the song available for instant download with the album pre-order. Another single, \" Dead Inside \", was released on 23 March. From 15 March to 16 May, Muse embarked on a short tour in small venues throughout the UK and the US, the Psycho Tour.

      "text": "Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music . In a career spanning nearly five decades, Davis was at the forefront of several major stylistic developments in jazz, including—but not limited to— bebop , cool jazz , hard bop , third stream , modal jazz , avant-garde jazz , and jazz fusion . Davis's legacy extends beyond jazz into the realms of rock , funk , classical , and hip-hop . Born into an upper-middle-class family in Alton, Illinois , and raised in East St. Louis , Davis started on the trumpet in his early teens. He left to study at Juilliard in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker 's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly afterwards, he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records , which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, while addicted to heroin, Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music under Prestige Records . After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival , he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records , and recorded the album 'Round About Midnight in 1955. It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers , key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans , such as the Spanish music –influenced Sketches of Spain (1960), and band recordings, such as Milestones (1958) and Kind of Blue (1959). The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time, having sold over five million copies in the U.S. Davis made several lineup changes while recording Someday My Prince Will Come (1961), his 1961 Blackhawk concerts , and Seven Steps to Heaven (1963), another commercial success that introduced bassist Ron Carter , pianist Herbie Hancock and drummer Tony Williams . After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964, Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as E.S.P. (1965) and Miles Smiles (1967), before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he experimented with rock, funk, African rhythms , emerging electronic music technology , and an ever-changing lineup of musicians, including keyboardist Joe Zawinul , drummer Al Foster , bassist Michael Henderson and guitarist John McLaughlin . This period, beginning with Davis's 1969 studio album In a",

The trumpet Davis used on the recording is displayed on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro . It was donated to the school by Arthur \"Buddy\" Gist, who met Davis in 1949 and became a close friend. The gift was the reason why the jazz program at UNCG is named the Miles Davis Jazz Studies Program. In 1986, the New England Conservatory awarded Davis an honorary doctorate for his contributions to music. Since 1960, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) honored him with eight Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards. In 2001, The Miles Davis Story , a two-hour documentary film by Mike Dibb , won an International Emmy Award for arts documentary of the year. Since 2005, the Miles Davis Jazz Committee has held an annual Miles Davis Jazz Festival. Also in 2005, the Davis biography, The Last Miles was published, and a London exhibition was held of his paintings, The Last Miles: The Music of Miles Davis, 1980–1991 , was released detailing his final years and eight of his albums from the 1960s and 1970s were reissued in celebration of the 50th anniversary of his signing to Columbia Records. In 2006, Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2012, the U.S. Postal Service issued commemorative stamps featuring Davis. Miles Ahead was a 2015 American music film directed by Don Cheadle , co-written by Cheadle with Steven Baigelman , Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson , which interprets the life and compositions of Davis. It premiered at the New York Film Festival in October 2015. The film stars Cheadle, Emayatzy Corinealdi as Frances Taylor, Ewan McGregor , Michael Stuhlbarg and Lakeith Stanfield . That same year a statue of him was erected in his home city, Alton, Illinois , and listeners of BBC Radio and Jazz FM voted Davis the greatest jazz musician. Publications such as The Guardian have also ranked Davis among the best of all jazz musicians. In 2018, American rapper Q-Tip played Miles Davis in a theater production titled My Funny Valentine . Q-Tip had previously played Davis in 2010. In 2019, the documentary Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool , directed by Stanley Nelson , premiered at the Sundance Film Festival . It was later released on PBS ' American Masters series. Davis is the subject of the upcoming period romance film Davis & Juliette about his meeting Juliette Gréco in Paris in 1949.
