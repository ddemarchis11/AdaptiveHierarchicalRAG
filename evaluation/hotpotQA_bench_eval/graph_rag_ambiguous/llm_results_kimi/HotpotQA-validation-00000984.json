      "text": "David Dunn is a fictional superhero and protagonist in M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable film series , portrayed by American actor Bruce Willis . Dunn is a former college football prodigy and a security guard who discovers he has superhuman abilities. He is the protagonist in Unbreakable , makes a cameo in Split , and again is a major character in Glass . Development Creation and casting When M. Night Shyamalan conceived the idea for Unbreakable , the outline had a comic book's traditional three-part structure: the superhero's \"birth,\" his struggles against general evil-doers, and the hero's ultimate battle against the \"archenemy.\" However, he found the origin story most interesting, and chose to write Unbreakable as one. Willis became attached while shooting The Sixth Sense , also directed by Shyamalan. Powers and abilities David Dunn possesses super-strength, enough to rip off a car door, bench press 500 pounds, break down a steel door, bend metal bars, and hurl a grown man several feet with tremendous force. With nothing to brace against while submerged, he was able to strike the weakened wall of a plastic water tank until it broke. He has nigh-invulnerability that renders him immune to disease and injuries, including traumas and shocks that would kill a normal human. Additionally, David possesses the ability of psychometry. He is able to intuitively read the minds of others, particularly as they relate to acts of violence and immorality, by touching them. He has demonstrated the ability to discover actions a person committed in the past (such as Price's sabotage of the train and the unnamed murderer's crimes) as well as potential/planned acts of violence (learning a man smuggled a gun into the sports stadium). Weakness David has a weakness to water; being exposed to water weakens him and drains his strength. He had a near-death experience when he nearly drowned at a young age due to children his age trying to push him under water. As a result, he wears a long, hooded raincoat as part of his vigilante disguise. Appearances Unbreakable David Dunn was born in Philadelphia and became a football player during college, before being caught in a car accident with his girlfriend Audrey. David is left unharmed but Audrey is injured, causing David to quit football to be with her. In the year 2000, David boards the Eastrail 177 train home but is later caught in a crash. David is recovered and examined by doctors, who reveal he was the only survivor of 132 passengers and that he suffered no injuries. This grabs the attention of comic book art gallery owner Elijah Price, who contacts David, taunting him, convincing him he has unique superhuman abilities. He then interrogates David about any similar past incidents, in an attempt to expose his abilities. This begins to scare David, who leaves the store. The following day, Elijah visits David at the stadium",

      "text": "Unbreakable is a 2000 American superhero thriller film written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan , and starring Bruce Willis , Samuel L. Jackson , and Robin Wright . In Unbreakable , David Dunn (Willis) survives a train crash with no injuries, leading to the realization that he harbors superhuman abilities. As he begins to grapple with this discovery, he comes to the attention of disabled comic book store owner Elijah Price (Jackson), who manipulates David to understand him. Shyamalan organized the narrative of Unbreakable to parallel a comic book's traditional three-part story structure . After settling on the origin story , Shyamalan wrote the screenplay as a speculative screenplay with Willis already set to star in the film and Jackson in mind to portray Elijah Price. Filming began in April 2000 and was completed in July. Unbreakable was released on November 22, 2000. It received generally positive reviews, with praise for Shyamalan's direction, screenplay, its aesthetics, the performances, the emotional weight of the story, cinematography, and the score by James Newton Howard . The film has subsequently gained a strong cult following . A realistic vision of the superhero genre, it is regarded by many as one of Shyamalan's best films and one of the best superhero films . In 2011, Time listed it as one of the top ten superhero films of all time, ranking it number four. Quentin Tarantino also included it on his list of the top 20 films released from 1992 to 2009. After years of development on a follow-up film, a thematic sequel, Split , with Willis reprising his role as David Dunn in a cameo role, was released in January 2017. After the financial and critical success of Split , Shyamalan immediately began working on a third film, titled Glass , which was released January 18, 2019, thus making Unbreakable the first installment in the Unbreakable film series. Plot In 1961 Philadelphia , baby Elijah Price is born with Type I osteogenesis imperfecta , a rare disease that renders his bones extremely fragile and prone to fracture. In the present day, former star quarterback and security guard David Dunn is returning home to Philadelphia after a job interview in New York when his train, Eastrail 177, suddenly speeds up. He wakes up in a hospital room, unscathed, and the doctors inform him he is the sole survivor of the derailment that killed all 131 other passengers. After attending a memorial service for the victims, David finds a note on his car asking how long it has been since he has been ill and inviting him to \"Limited Edition\", an art gallery operated by the now-adult Elijah Price. He goes with his son Joseph to meet Elijah. Elijah explains his theory of real-life superheroes, and if he represents extreme frailty, there must be someone",

      "text": "\"Whether it means to or not, the shadow of The Sixth Sense hangs over Unbreakable ,\" Turan reasoned. \"If The Sixth Sense hadn't been as big a success as it was, this story might have been assigned to oblivion, or at least to rewrite.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety mostly criticized Shyamalan's writing and the performances given by the actors. He did praise Dylan Tichenor 's editing and James Newton Howard 's music composition. In 2002, Audrey Colombe described the movie's plot as an example of what \" Toni Morrison calls a 'dehistoricizing allegory,'\" with the Elijah Price character as yet another example of \"White Hollywood\"'s \" magical African American male character \" helping the white hero do the right thing, though Elijah is described as a rare exception to the rule that this character is \"never 'bad'\". Shyamalan admitted he was disappointed by the reaction Unbreakable received from the public and critics. Shyamalan also disliked Touchstone Pictures ' marketing campaign. He wanted to promote Unbreakable as a comic book movie, but Touchstone insisted on portraying it as a psychological thriller , similar to The Sixth Sense . Later reviews In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Unbreakable , and included it on his list of the top 20 films released since 1992, the year he became a director. Tarantino praised the film as a \"brilliant retelling of the Superman mythology\", and said it contains what he considers to be Bruce Willis' best performance. He also criticized the way the film was marketed upon release, stating he felt that it would have been far more effective if the film's advertising simply posed the question of \"what if Superman was here on earth, and didn't know he was Superman?\" In 2011, Time ranked the film at No. 4 in its list of top ten superhero movies of all time, describing it as one of the best superhero origin stories and as a \"relatively quiet, subtle and realistic look at the pressures that come with being a superhero.\" In 2018, The Hollywood Reporter called it a \"deconstruction of the American superhero/villain complex\" that is \"more prescient than ever.\" Home media Unbreakable was released on DVD and VHS on June 26, 2001. The DVD version is a THX certified two-disc set that features a DTS audio track, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes and other bonus material. This release sold 2.3 million units in the United States, and was the top DVD video rental of 2001. It grossed a total of $123.11 million from DVD sales and DVD/VHS rentals in the United States. The film thus had a combined global box office and U.S. home video revenue of $371,028,653, with a 495% return on investment . In 2008, the movie was",

The people whose bad deeds are sensed by David are identified by an article of clothing in a single bright color (red, orange), to contrast them with the dark and dreary color scheme typical of the rest of the movie (but not of most comic books). Several scenes also depict characters through reflections or doorways, as if framing them in a picture similar to comic books. Reception Box office Unbreakable was released in the United States on November 22, 2000, in 2,708 theaters and grossed $30.3 million in its opening weekend, finishing second at the box office behind How the Grinch Stole Christmas . The film ended up earning $95 million domestically and $153.1 million internationally for a total of $248.1 million, against its $75 million production budget. Critical response Unbreakable received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 70% based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"With a weaker ending, Unbreakable is not as good as The Sixth Sense . However, it is a quietly suspenseful film that intrigues and engages, taking the audience through unpredictable twists and turns along the way.\" On Metacritic , the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times , gave Unbreakable 3 out of 4 stars and had largely enjoyed the film, but was disappointed with the ending. Ebert believed that Willis's \"subtle acting\" was positively different from the actor's usual work in \"brainless action movies\". Richard Corliss of Time opined that Unbreakable continued Shyamalan's previous approach of \"balancing sophistication and horror in all of his movies\". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post wrote that \"just as he did in The Sixth Sense , writer-director M. Night Shyamalan leads you into a fascinating labyrinth , an alternative universe that lurks right under our noses. In this case, it's the mythological world and, in these modern times, the secret design to that labyrinth, the key to the path, is contained in comic books.\" Kenneth Turan , writing for the Los Angeles Times , gave a negative review, arguing that Unbreakable had no originality. \"Whether it means to or not, the shadow of The Sixth Sense hangs over Unbreakable ,\" Turan reasoned. \"If The Sixth Sense hadn't been as big a success as it was, this story might have been assigned to oblivion, or at least to rewrite.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety",

During the filming of The Sixth Sense , Shyamalan had already approached Bruce Willis for the lead role of David Dunn. With Willis and Samuel L.

Jackson recalled meeting Willis in a casino in Casablanca while he was on vacation prior to Unbreakable ' s production; Willis told Jackson that he had just finished filming for Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense and told Jackson about the new script that was written for both of them.

      "text": "would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes. Comics scholar Ben Saunders points out that this emphasis on adolescence was an important innovation for superhero comics . Lee required Marvel publisher Martin Goodman 's approval for the character. In a 1986 interview, Lee gives his arguments against Goodman's objections. Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee, in numerous interviews, recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy , which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for issue #15 ( cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962). In particular, Lee states that the decision that Amazing Fantasy would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to present Spider-Man. While this was the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the continuing appearances of Spider-Man in future issues. Lee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the \"ordinary teen\" concept and approached artist Jack Kirby . As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby \"immediately sat down for a story conference\", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker. When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, \"I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic\". Lee turned to Ditko, who developed an art style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled: One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character.... Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked. As Lee explained in 2010, \"I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers.\" Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) first introduced the character. It was a gateway to commercial success for the superhero and inspired the launch of The Amazing Spider-Man comic book. – Cover art by penciller Jack Kirby and inker Steve Ditko Kirby disputed Lee's version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation.

Staple places the two in an institution where Elijah has been held since his arrest. David and Kevin are put in separate rooms which hold security measures exploiting their weaknesses to contain them. Later, Elijah becomes interested in the Beast so he decides to free him and team up together to escape. However, before leaving, Elijah contacts David over the PA to reveal to him his plan to destroy the Osaka Tower in Philadelphia before Elijah would expose real-life superheroes. This prompts David to escape his room and confronts the Beast again outside the facility. The fight is interrupted when Joseph exposes that Kevin's father was also on the Eastrail 177 leaving Kevin alone with his mother who begins abusing him leaving Elijah to come to the conclusion of his creation of both David and Kevin's alter egos The Overseer and The Horde. The Beast thanks Elijah for his creation and brutally injures him, then throws David into a water tank in an attempt to drown him. David manages to gather his strength to escape but is weakened by the water. One of Staple's men walks over to David and drags him over to a nearby pothole filled with water after the tank exploded. The man pushes David's face in the water, which drowns and eventually kills him. Staple reveals that she is part of an organization with the goal of silencing people with superhuman abilities to maintain a societal balance even when David uses his ability to learn this upon grabbing her. Elijah dies from his injuries received from Kevin, who is shot and killed by a sniper.

Elijah explains his theory of real-life superheroes, and if he represents extreme frailty, there must be someone \"unbreakable\" at the opposite extreme. David is unsettled and leaves, but later finds he can bench press 350 pounds well above his expectations. Joseph idolizes his father, believing him to be a superhero, although David maintains that he is ordinary. David challenges Elijah's theory with a childhood incident when he almost drowned and contracted pneumonia . Elijah suggests that this highlights the common convention where superheroes have a weakness, contending that David's is water. David recalls the car accident in which he was unharmed and ripped off the car door with his bare hands to rescue his girlfriend, Audrey. He feigned injury from the crash to quit football because Audrey hated the violence of the sport. Under Elijah's influence, David realizes that his intuition for picking out dangerous people in his work as a security guard is actually extrasensory perception . Consciously honing this ability, David discovers that touch contact with people brings him visions of criminal acts they have committed. As people bump into him in a crowd, he senses the crimes they have perpetrated such as theft, assault, and rape. He finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who has invaded a family home, killed the father, and is now holding the mother and two children captive. David follows the janitor to the victims' house and frees the children. The janitor pushes him into a swimming pool from the balcony, where he nearly drowns as he cannot swim, but is rescued by the children. David strangles the janitor to death, but finds the janitor has killed the mother. The following day, David shows Joseph a newspaper article featuring a sketch of the anonymous hero, whom Joseph recognizes as his father, and tearfully promises to keep his secret. David meets Elijah's elderly mother, who explains the difference between villains who fight heroes with physical strength and those who use their intelligence. Elijah asks David to shake his hand, which reveals that Elijah was responsible for numerous high-profile \"accidents,\" including David's train crash, to find his superhero rival. Elijah tells David, \"Now that we know who you are, I know who I am\". He adopts his childhood nickname, \"Mr. Glass,\" as his supervillain moniker.

Written by film producer Wong Jing , Naked Weapon is similar in theme though unrelated to his earlier work Naked Killer (1992). The film revolves around three assassins who get close to their targets, primarily through seduction, before they kill them. The film grossed HK$ 72,828 in the first week of release in Hong Kong but quickly dropped in the subsequent month, therefore a box-office bomb . Plot The movie opens with the assassination of a man of unknown identity. A team of three CIA officers, including rookie Jack Chen ( Daniel Wu ), watch through surveillance as an assassin named Fiona Birch (Marit Thoresen) enters the man's heavily guarded apartment suite and, after having sex with him, kills him by breaking his spine with her bare hands during a massage. As she makes her escape, Fiona's car is hit by a rocket. As the CIA officers rush over to extricate her from the wreckage, they are shot and killed by a woman in a limousine, leaving Jack as the only survivor. The woman in the limousine is revealed to be Madam M ( Almen Wong ), the leader of a mysterious assassin organization. After the incident, young girls across the globe start disappearing one after another. The only relationship among them is that they are all trained in martial arts or sports. As Jack correctly theorizes, these girls have been abducted by Madam M and transported to an island to be trained to become professional assassins. After six years of gruesome training, only Charlene Ching ( Maggie Q ), Katt ( Anya Wu ) and Jing ( Jewel Lee ) survive and \"graduate.\" The last test in order for them to graduate was a fight to the death test. Katt and Charlene, being friends, could not kill each other, and so each is accepted as a survivor. To celebrate, Madam M gives them all wines that have drugs in them. As the drugs take effect, Madam M calls her guards to rape the girls, thus (in Madam M's words) making them ready for what was to come. The three girls are then sent on several missions around the world. During one of her missions in Hong Kong, Charlene runs into her long-lost mother, Faye Ching ( Cheng Pei-pei ). Jack tracks Charlene down, but Charlene manages to knock him out and escape. Believing she would return to see her mother, Jack waits outside Faye's house. However, Jing arrives before Charlene and stabs Faye. Jack tries to fend her off but fails. Charlene shows up and kills Jing after a fierce fight.

Night Shyamalan’s 2000 film *Unbreakable* re-imagines superheroes as real-world archetypes, following security guard David Dunn who survives a train wreck without injury and discovers invulnerability and extrasensory crime detection. Comic-art dealer Elijah Price, whose brittle-bone disease embodies extreme fragility, guides David toward accepting his role as an “unbreakable” hero while secretly engineering fatal disasters—including the train crash—to locate his opposite. The movie adopts comic-book panel framing, color coding (David in green, Elijah in purple), and a three-act origin structure, earning $248 million worldwide and cult status despite mixed initial reviews. Production details—Philadelphia shooting, glass motifs, deleted scenes—and critical debates about originality versus *The Sixth Sense* are also covered.  \n\n**Keywords**:  \nUnbreakable, M.
