The competition has been held every four years and one year after the men's FIFA World Cup since 1991, when the inaugural tournament , then called the FIFA Women's World Championship, was held in China. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for the remaining 31 slots in a three-year qualification phase. The host nation's team is automatically entered as the first slot. The tournament, called the World Cup Finals , is contested at venues within the host nation(s) over about one month. The nine FIFA Women's World Cup tournaments have been won by five national teams. The United States have won four times. The other winners are Germany , with two titles, and Japan , Norway , and Spain with one title each. Eight countries have hosted the Women's World Cup. China and the United States have each hosted the tournament twice, while Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, and Sweden have each hosted it once.

The club is based in the city of Adelaide , South Australia , and will play their home games at the State Basketball Centre in Wayville from the 2025–26 season. History The Adelaide Lightning were formed in 1993 as a South Australian composite team following multiple Adelaide team entries in the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) since the league's inception in 1981. The Lightning originally played at the Clipsal Powerhouse . Under coach Jan Stirling , the Lighting won three straight WNBL championships between 1994 and 1996 . After a runner-up finish in 1997 , the Lighting won their fourth championship in 1998 . They finished runners-up again in 2000 . Between 1993 and 2009, the team played in the WNBL playoffs every year. The club's captain during its glory years of the 1990s was Rachael Sporn . Sporn represented Australia at three Olympic Games, winning two silver and one bronze medal, and three World Championships. She played 377 WNBL games and was named MVP in 1996 and 1997 and was a key member of the Lightning's four championships. She was inducted into the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007. Her number 14 jersey was retired in 2007. The team changed to private ownership in 2005–06 , with Fellas Gifts taking over the club and renaming the team to Adelaide Fellas . After one season, the team was sold to Link Engineering, with new owner Vince Marino changing the team name back to Adelaide Lightning for the 2006–07 WNBL season . In the 2007–08 season, the Lightning won their fifth WNBL championship with a 92–82 grand final victory over the Sydney Uni Flames . In the 2013–14 season, the Lightning entered a one-year management agreement with the Adelaide 36ers of the NBL , allowing the 36ers to oversee the club's marketing, membership, and sponsorship operations. This arrangement aimed to streamline resources between the two clubs. Following the 2014–15 season, Vince Marino relinquish the team's WNBL licence. For the 2015–16 season, Basketball SA assumed control of the Lightning while seeking a new owner for the team. In 2016–17, the Adelaide Basketball consortium took over the club and appointed Chris Lucas as head coach. The consortium was later sold to Grant Kelley, who managed the team through the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons. At the end of the 2018–19 season—during which the Lightning reached the Grand Final, ultimately falling to Canberra in Game 3—Kelley announced that Adelaide Basketball would return the team's licence. On 5 March 2019, Bruce Spangler and a group of business associates were granted the licence",
