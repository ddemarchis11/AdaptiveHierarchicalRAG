He has said, \"My earliest memories were on the cattle stations up in the Outback, and then we moved back to Melbourne and then back out there and then back again. Certainly most of my childhood was in Melbourne but probably my most vivid memories were up there [in Bulman] with crocodiles and buffalo. Very different walks of life.\" He attended high school at Heathmont College before his family again returned to the Northern Territory, and then moved a few years later to Phillip Island . Career Early work (2002–2010) Hemsworth started his career by appearing in several television series.

      "text": "Thor: The Dark World is a 2013 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Thor , produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures . It is the sequel to Thor (2011) and the eighth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Alan Taylor from a screenplay by Christopher Yost and the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely . It stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor alongside Natalie Portman , Tom Hiddleston , Stellan Skarsgård , Idris Elba , Christopher Eccleston , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje , Kat Dennings , Ray Stevenson , Zachary Levi , Tadanobu Asano , Jaimie Alexander , Rene Russo , and Anthony Hopkins . In the film, Thor and Loki (Hiddleston) team up to save the Nine Realms from the Dark Elves . Development of a sequel to Thor began in April 2011 when producer Kevin Feige announced plans for it to follow the MCU crossover film The Avengers (2012). In July, Thor director Kenneth Branagh withdrew from the sequel. Taylor was hired to replace him as director in January 2012. The supporting cast filled out that August with the hiring of Eccleston and Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the film's villains. Filming took place from September to December 2012, primarily in Surrey , England, as well as in Iceland and London. Taylor wanted the film to be more grounded than Thor , inspired by his work on Game of Thrones (2011–2019). He hired Carter Burwell to compose the score, but Marvel replaced Burwell with Brian Tyler . Thor: The Dark World premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on October 22, 2013, and was released in the United States on November 8, as part of Phase Two of the MCU. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $644 million worldwide and becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of 2013 . It received praise for the performances of Hemsworth and Hiddleston, visual effects, and action sequences, but was criticized for its generic villain and lack of depth. Retrospectively, Taylor expressed dissatisfaction with the film and said Marvel substantially altered it from his original vision during post-production . Two sequels have been released: Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). Plot Eons ago, Bor —the father of Odin —wages war against the Dark Elf Malekith , who seeks to unleash a weapon known as the Aether on the Nine Realms . After defeating Malekith's forces on their homeworld of Svartalfheim , Bor sends the Aether to a hidden world that no one can reach. However, Malekith escapes with his lieutenant Algrim and a handful of Dark Elves before going into suspended animation . In present-day",

Then from there we went in there populating the terrain with different buildings.\" For scenes taking place on Svartalfheim, production filmed in Iceland with Double Negative adding ruins, mountains, Dark Elf ships, and skies. For the shot of the levitating truck, which was used in the film to demonstrate the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement. In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live-action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects. [ infringing link? ] The film's climactic battle sequence takes place through the nine worlds by the use of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, \"We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we wanted to do was to make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on.\" Music In August 2012, Patrick Doyle said that he had discussions with the director about potentially returning to score the film. By April 2013, Carter Burwell had been hired to compose the score, but by the following month he left the film over creative differences. In June 2013, Marvel hired Brian Tyler , who scored Iron Man 3 (2013), to replace Burwell. Tyler said the previous film had an \"attitude and [was] grounded in limitations\" whereas the Thor film allowed for \"all-out regal themes that could be as epic as I could make them.\" The composer described The Dark World as \"science fiction meeting classic medieval war\", leading to a score that drew from works of both genres such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings . Azam Ali is a featured vocalist on the score. The soundtrack was released digitally on October 28, 2013. Marketing Hiddleston as Loki at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film In March 2013, Marvel announced the release of a two-issue comic book prelude by writers Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost and artist Scot Eaton in June 2013.

So, in a way, that was what I had to think of: how revenge can make you absolutely monomaniacal—though you're still trying to make it recognizably motive-led. It's just the personification of movie evil.\" However Taylor stated that many scenes involving Malekith's backstory had to be cut from the film to make it more efficient. Eccleston revealed that he speaks an invented language for the film explaining, \"The Elvish language is definitely based on European languages. I think there's probably some Finnish in there. It does have its logic and its rhythms. It also has many syllables and it's very difficult to do while remaining naturalistic. It's been a particular challenge for us but hopefully it gives the film some complexity and variety.\" Eccleston also said the role required six hours of make-up and 45 minutes in wardrobe. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Algrim / Kurse : A Dark Elf and Malekith's trusted and loyal lieutenant who is transformed into a monstrous creature in order to destroy Thor. Akinnuoye-Agbaje described Kurse as \"an amalgamation of a bull and a lava-like creature. He has very animalistic tendencies but with this insatiable and unstoppable power. As an actor, that's one of the hardest things to embody. You have to realize you are probably the most powerful thing you could imagine. And you have to be that. You can't pretend, so that when you face Thor, it's real.\" Akinnuoye-Agbaje stated the role required three hours of make-up a day and had to put on heavy duty prosthetics explaining, \"The outfit weighed about 40 pounds. I'm sure there will be a certain amount of CGI but a good 80% was me in that suit.\" About the character Akinnuoye-Agbaje said, \"I suppose Algrim and Kurse would be the quintessential baddies, but in reality they are what I perceive as the scorn and the victims of the story. They are the elves who have basically lost their planet and their race to another race, the Asgardians. Here is a man/alien who places a noble objective beyond his own life and I think there is something extremely inspiring about that because he looks at the bigger picture and sees himself as a means to that end.\" Akinnuoye-Agbaje added, \"I worked with director Alan Taylor in trying to maintain Algrim's humanity all the way throughout Kurse's transformation, so that even when you see Kurse the beast, you can still relate to him as being Algrim inside. And symbolically we did that by keeping the same piercing blue eyes throughout.\" Kat",

      "text": "Thor: God of Thunder is a 2011 American action hack and slash video game based on the Marvel Studios film Thor . The game was developed by Liquid Entertainment and co-written by Matt Fraction . Thor: God of Thunder marks Thor 's first standalone appearance in a video game and features the voices of Chris Hemsworth , Tom Hiddleston and Jaimie Alexander , who reprise their roles from the film. The game was released in 2011 for Nintendo DS , PlayStation 3 , Wii , Xbox 360 and Nintendo 3DS . The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game can be played in 3D on 3DTVs and on 2DTVs via TriOviz Inificolor 3D glasses. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were met with unfavorable reviews, while the Wii, DS, and 3DS versions were met with mixed reviews. Despite the game's existence outside of the canonicity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe , some characters from the game, such as Surtur and Hela (from the Nintendo DS version), eventually appeared in the 2017 film Thor: Ragnarok . Plot The game begins in medias res with Asgard being invaded by the Jötun (frost giants from Jotunheim). Thor , meanwhile, is training with Sif and his brother Loki . Their training is interrupted, however, by the arrival of the Frost Giants. While Loki leaves to inform Odin about the invasion, Thor is left to fight alone after Sif is frozen by one of the arriving jötun. After quickly fending his enemies off and setting Sif free, Thor goes to Odin's castle to defend Asgard . The invasion is stopped, but Sif is fatally wounded in the process. After Thor is denied retribution for the invasion and Sif's condition by Odin, Thor disobeys his father's orders. He travels to Niflheim, aided by one of Loki's projected clones (revealed to be the mastermind behind the invasion). While Thor travels to Niflheim, it is shown that Odin manages to save Sif from death, and then he proceeds to enter the Odinsleep. As Thor arrives in Niflheim, Loki tells him to find Ymir , Lord of the Jötun and Ruler of Niflheim. After a long battle, Thor finds and defeats Ymir inside the Cave of Ages. There, Thor finds the source of a power that, as Loki says, can destroy the entire realm of Niflheim. Ignoring Ymir's warnings, Thor activates the source, which transforms into a golden, metallic, minotaur-like creature known as Mangog that instantly vaporizes Ymir. Loki then sends an unaware (and guilt-ridden) Thor to Vanaheim rather than Asgard, as Thor wanted. Loki (who wants to prove himself to Odin as a rightful heir to",

It's all the stuff we're interested in at a psychological level because we're living it all the time. But it takes place in this otherwise fantastical, foreign realm. I think the same thing is true in Thor . The brilliant thing Ken Branagh did in launching it was making it very much a story about two brothers, a story about brothers competing for the love of their father. So it's small, confined and human at the same time it's this blown-out, intergalactic world.\" —Alan Taylor, director of Thor: The Dark World and several episodes of Game of Thrones In April 2011, before the release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), \"Thor will go off into a new adventure.\" Kenneth Branagh , director of Thor , responded to his comments, saying, \"It is kind of news to me. Here's what I would say to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether there should be a second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [among] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true\". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, \" Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [Branagh] to discuss coming back, but right now the focus is on the first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky\". In June 2011, Walt Disney Studios set a July 26, 2013, release date for the Thor sequel with Chris Hemsworth reprising his role as the title hero. It was also reported that Branagh would not be returning as director but would likely be involved in a producing capacity. The Los Angeles Times",

The Asgardians learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random.
