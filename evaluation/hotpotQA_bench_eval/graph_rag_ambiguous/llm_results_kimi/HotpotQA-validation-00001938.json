I can't imagine making movies would have been half as much fun without him. He loved being naughty, finding and jumping off of small buildings on the back lot. While I was Victorian proper and wouldn't let myself get dirty or muddy, Matthew had a great sense of fun and danger. He was a daredevil and could have been a race car driver.

      "text": "Karen Dotrice ( / d oʊ ˈ t r iː s / doh- TREESS ; born 9 November 1955) is a British actress. She is known primarily for her role as Jane Banks in Walt Disney 's Mary Poppins , the feature film adaptation of the Mary Poppins book series. Dotrice was born in Guernsey in the Channel Islands to two stage actors. Her career began on stage, and expanded into film and television, including starring roles as a young girl whose beloved cat magically reappears in Disney's The Three Lives of Thomasina and with Thomasina co-star Matthew Garber as one of two children pining for their parents' attentions in Poppins . Dotrice appeared in five television programmes between 1972 and 1978, when she made her only feature film as an adult. Dotrice's life as an actress concluded with a short run as Desdemona in the 1981 pre- Broadway production of Othello . In 1984, Dotrice retired from show business to focus on motherhood—she has three children from two marriages—though she has provided commentary for various Disney projects and has resumed making public appearances, including a cameo in Mary Poppins Returns in 2018. Dotrice was named a Disney Legend in 2004. Early life Born on 9 November 1955 into a theatrical family, Dotrice is the daughter of Kay ( née Katharine Newman) and Roy Dotrice , two Shakespearean actors who met and married while performing in repertory productions in the United Kingdom. Roy was also born in the Channel Islands. Dotrice has two sisters, including Michele . Her godfather was actor Charles Laughton , who was married to Elsa Lanchester , who would also appear in Mary Poppins . Roy was a Wireless Operator serving with 106 Squadron of the Royal Air Force, and along with his other six crew, was shot down and taken prisoner of war on the night of 2/3 May 1942. Dotrice was a toddler when her father joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (later the Royal Shakespeare Company ) in 1957. At age four, Dotrice was ready to perform, making her debut in an RSC production of The Caucasian Chalk Circle by Bertolt Brecht . There, a Disney scout saw Dotrice and brought her to Burbank , California , to meet Walt Disney . Career Film At age eight, Dotrice was hired in 1963 to appear in The Three Lives of Thomasina as a girl whose relationship with her father is mended by the magical reappearance of her cat. Matthew Garber also appeared in the movie. While Dotrice was in California, her father stayed in England—where he was portraying King Lear —and Walt Disney personally took care of her family, often hosting them in his Palm Springs home. Dotrice took quickly to Disney as a father figure, calling him",

While Dotrice was in California, her father stayed in England—where he was portraying King Lear —and Walt Disney personally took care of her family, often hosting them in his Palm Springs home. Dotrice took quickly to Disney as a father figure, calling him \"Uncle Walt\". She said that the admiration was mutual: \"I think he really liked English kids. He was tickled pink by the accent and the etiquette. And when I was being very English and polite, he would look proudly at this little child who had such good manners.\" Film historian Leonard Maltin said Dotrice \"won over everyone\" with her performance in The Three Lives of Thomasina , and Dotrice was signed to play Jane Banks (along with Matthew Garber as her brother, Michael Banks) in Mary Poppins (1964). Disney's part- live-action , part- animation musical adaptation of the Poppins children's books by P. L. Travers starred David Tomlinson as a workaholic father and Glynis Johns as a suffragette mother who are too busy to spend much time with their children. Instead, they hire a nanny ( Julie Andrews ) who takes Jane and Michael on magical adventures designed to teach them—and their parents—about the importance of family. Poppins was Disney's biggest commercial success at the time and won five Academy Awards , making its stars world-famous. Dotrice and Garber were praised for their natural screen presence; critic Bosley Crowther wrote, \"the kids ... are just as they should be,\" while author Brian Sibley said, \"these charming, delightful young people provided a wonderful centre for the film.\" Dotrice and Garber paired up a third and final time in The Gnome-Mobile (1967) as the grandchildren of a rich lumber mogul who stumble across a gnome forest and help to stop the gnomes from dying off. Starring Walter Brennan in a dual role, The Gnome-Mobile failed to perform on a par with Poppins at the box office, and Dotrice did not make another film appearance as a child. After The Gnome-Mobile , Dotrice and Garber no longer kept in contact with each other. In an interview for the '40th Anniversary Edition' DVD release of Mary Poppins , Dotrice recalled how she learned of Garber's 1977 death: \"I remember his mum, Margot, calling [...] to let us know that Matthew had died. That was so unexpected. [...] I wished I had picked up the phone over the years, I wished I had treated him more like a brother; but he's indelibly printed in all of our minds, he's eternal. An amazing little soul.\" In another interview she recalled: \"[Matthew] was how he looked—an imp, and I loved being his shadow.

She was the author of the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt and William Monk series of historical detective fiction . In 1994, it became public knowledge that Perry had been convicted of murder in Christchurch , New Zealand in 1954 when she was fifteen. She and her sixteen-year-old friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker's mother, Honorah . After serving a five-year sentence for the murder, Perry changed her name from Juliet Hulme and returned to the United Kingdom. She was identified by the media following the release of the film Heavenly Creatures , directed by Peter Jackson , which is based on the case. Early life Juliet Marion Hulme was born on 28 October 1938 in London, the second child and first daughter of physicist Henry Rainsford Hulme . Hulme was diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child and sent to the Caribbean , South Africa, and New Zealand in hopes that a warmer climate would improve her health. She rejoined her family after her father took a position as rector of Canterbury University College in New Zealand. She attended Christchurch Girls' High School , located in what became the Cranmer Centre . A 1948 Auckland Star photograph of Hulme arriving in New Zealand was discovered by Auckland Libraries staff in 2012 and written about in the Heritage et AL blog. Murder and trial In June 1954, at the age of 15, Hulme and her best friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker's mother, Honorah Rieper. Hulme's parents were in the process of separating and she was supposed to go to South Africa to stay with a relative. The two teenage friends, who had created a complicated fantasy life together populated with celebrities such as Mario Lanza and James Mason , did not want to be separated. On 22 June 1954, the girls and Rieper went for a walk in Victoria Park in the Port Hills of Christchurch . On an isolated path, Hulme dropped an ornamental stone so that Rieper would lean over to retrieve it. Parker had planned to hit her mother with half a brick wrapped in a stocking. The girls presumed that one blow would kill her but it took more than 20. Parker and Hulme stood trial in Christchurch in 1954 and were found guilty on 28 August. As they were too young to be considered for the death penalty under New Zealand law at the time, they were convicted and sentenced to be \"detained at Her Majesty's pleasure \". They were released separately five years later. At the time of Perry's death in 2023, Parker and Perry were not believed to have had any contact since the trial. The events formed the basis for the 1994 film Heavenly Creatures , in which Melanie Lynskey portrayed a teenaged Pauline Parker and",
