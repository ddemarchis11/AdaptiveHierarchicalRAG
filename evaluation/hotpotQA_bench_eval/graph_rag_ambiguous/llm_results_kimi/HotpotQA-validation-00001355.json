Over the following months, candidacies were announced by Joy Waymire, Cecil Ince, Steve Kerbel, Shawna Joy Sterling, Derrick Michael Reid, and Rhett Smith. In early September, candidates entering the race included John David Hale, Jack Robinson Jr, and Austin Petersen . On December 24, 2015, antivirus software pioneer John McAfee abandoned his previous effort to run as the candidate of a newly created Cyber Party, and announced he would instead seek the Libertarian nomination. He had previously announced that his Cyber Party running mate would be Ken Rutkowski , but Rutkowski did not join him in seeking the Libertarian nomination. Gary Johnson formally announced his candidacy for the 2016 Libertarian presidential nomination , in an interview with Neil Cavuto on the Fox Business Network program Coast to Coast , on January 6, 2016. April 2016: Top tier emerges Though the Libertarian Party has little to no scientific polling and does not conduct binding primaries and caucuses, the first nationally televised pre-nominating convention Libertarian Party debate featured three candidates widely regarded as the leading contenders for the nomination: former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson , founder and CEO of McAfee Inc. John McAfee and owner and founder of The Libertarian Republic Austin Petersen . A later debate hosted by RT America featured Marc Allan Feldman, Kevin McCormick, and Darryl Perry, however this did not receive as much media attention as the one featuring the three candidates in the top tier. Early May 2016: Ventura declines to run Jesse Ventura speaking in Minnesota in 2016. In several late 2015 interviews including those on The Alan Colmes Show and In Depth with Graham Bensinger , Jesse Ventura publicly flirted with the idea of running for president in 2016 as a Libertarian. Beginning on February 29, 2016, Ventura again made headlines following an announcement that if Bernie Sanders were to lose the Democratic Party nomination to Hillary Clinton , he would launch a presidential campaign under the Libertarian Party . Ventura subsequently appeared on RT , CNN , Alex Jones and various local radio outlets the following several days reiterating interest in a presidential campaign. He likewise revealed that he was formally invited to the 2016 Libertarian National Convention in Orlando, Florida by party leaders and that he would announce by the end of March if he were to go that route. On March 3, 2016 Ventura released a shortlist of preliminary campaign platforms if he were to run for president. Included were rebuilding infrastructure, focusing on alternative energy, ending all foreign wars and following the teachings of Major General Smedley Butler , ending the war on drugs and reforming campaign financing . Ventura ultimately decided not to seek the presidency, allowing his self determined deadline of May 1 to pass without an announcement. In mid-July, Ventura wrote an article declaring his support for Gary Johnson. Late May 2016: Johnson",

      "text": "The 2016 Libertarian Party presidential primaries and caucuses allowed electors to indicate non-binding preferences for the Libertarian Party 's presidential candidate. These differed from the Republican or Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses in that they did not appoint delegates to represent a candidate at the party's convention to select the party's nominee for the United States presidential election . The party's nominee for the 2016 presidential election was chosen directly by registered delegates at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention , which ran from May 26 to 30, 2016. The delegates nominated former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson for president and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld for vice president. Four primaries and one caucus were held. Missouri and North Carolina held primaries on March 15, as an alternative ballot to other primaries such as those of the Republicans and Democrats . Gary Johnson , who had won the party's nomination in the 2012 presidential election , won North Carolina with 42%. In Missouri a plurality of voters chose the \"Uncommitted\" option over local candidate Austin Petersen, 40% to 29%, with Johnson not appearing on the Missouri ballot due to announcing his candidacy after the filing deadline. An Oregon primary was run on May 27 during the national convention, while the California primary was held on June 7 after the party's convention. The only caucus was in Minnesota on March 1, where 75% of the electors selected Gary Johnson. Jurisdictions in the 2016 primaries that did not participate in conventional roll call included: American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, Puerto Rico, and the U.S Virgin Islands. Candidates 24 candidates were recognized by the Libertarian Party and 16 were ultimately eligible for the presidential nomination at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention . For a candidate to have been recognized by the Libertarian Party, they must have: had a campaign website; been a dues-paying member of the party; met all U.S. Constitutional requirements to serve as President ; and not have simultaneously been a candidate for another political party. Of the recognized candidates, eight did not run in any primary or caucus: Joey Berry, Brian Briggs, Thomas Clements, Malisia Garcia, Kevin McCormick, Robert Milnes, Mike Shannon and Heidi Zeman. The other ten recognized candidates as well as three unrecognized candidates – John David Hale (who was disrecognized because he was under 35 and so ineligible to serve as President), Nathan Norman and Merry Susan Nehls – stood in at least one primary or caucus, and appear in the table below. Five recognized candidates withdrew: Cecil Ince, Steve Kerbel, Joy Waymire, Bart Lower and Donald Eugene Lowe. Timeline of the race Background The 2016 United States presidential election was the twelfth contested election for the Libertarian Party of the United States.

And in this country, we have a growing police state – if people can own assault rifles or automatic rifles , I think leads to a more civil government.\" Johnson would, however, limit weapons such as rocket launchers . Johnson believes that allowing concealed carrying of guns reduces crime and gun violence. He opposes barring gun sales to individuals on the no-fly list , because he claims that such lists have a high error rate. Johnson has called for a \"thousand-person taskforce\" or \"hot line\" to prevent terrorists from obtaining guns, and has questioned why the perpetrator of the Orlando nightclub shooting was not \"deprived of his guns\" after being interviewed three times.

Johnson has since maintained a low profile and has had little involvement in politics. Early life and career Johnson was born on January 1, 1953, in Minot, North Dakota , the son of Lorraine B. (née Bostow), who worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs , and Earl W. Johnson, a public school teacher and World War II Army veteran who participated in the Invasion of Normandy and fought at the Battle of Bastogne , earning three Purple Hearts during his service in the 101st Airborne Division . In 1971, Johnson graduated from Sandia High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico , where he was on the school track team. He attended the University of New Mexico (UNM) from 1971 to 1975 and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in political science . While at UNM, he joined the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. It was there that he met his future wife, Denise \"Dee\" Simms. While in college, Johnson earned money as a door-to-door handyman. His success in that industry encouraged him to start his own business, Big J Enterprises, in 1976. When he started the business, which focused on mechanical contracting, Johnson was its only employee. His firm's major break came when he received a large contract from Intel 's expansion in Rio Rancho , which increased Big J's revenue to $38 million. To cope with the growth of the company, Johnson enrolled in a time management course at night school , which he credits with making him heavily goal driven. He eventually grew Big J into a multimillion-dollar corporation with over 1,000 employees. By the time he sold the company in 1999, it was one of New Mexico's leading construction companies. Governor of New Mexico First term Johnson entered politics in 1994 with the intention of running for governor and was advised by \"Republican Elders\" to run for the State Legislature instead. Despite their advice, Johnson spent $500,000 of his own money and entered the race with the intent of bringing a \"common sense business approach\" to the office. Johnson's campaign slogan was \"People before Politics\". His platform emphasized tax cuts, job creation, state government spending growth restraint, and law and order . He won the Republican nomination, defeating state legislator Richard P. Cheney by 34% to 33%, with John Dendahl and former governor David F. Cargo in third and fourth. Johnson subsequently won a plurality in the three-way general election, defeating the incumbent Governor Bruce King (a relatively conservative Democrat ) and the former Lieutenant Governor Roberto Mondragón (who ran as a Green ) with just under 50% of the vote. Johnson was elected in a nationally Republican year, although party registration in the state of New Mexico at",

The 2012 Libertarian National Convention , in which delegates of the Libertarian Party (LP) chose the party's nominees for president and vice president in the 2012 general election , was held May 2–6, 2012, in Las Vegas, Nevada , at the Red Rock Resort Spa and Casino . Former Governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson won the presidential nomination on the first ballot. Retired California state court judge Jim Gray won the vice presidential nomination, also on the first ballot.

Candidates debate In February 2012, Gary Johnson , Lee Wrights, Bill Still, Carl Person , and Leroy Saunders participated in a debate held by the Libertarian Party of Florida and moderated by LPUSA Chair Mark Hinkle.  The debate participants were selected by convention delegates in a secret ballot, in which a candidate needed to score 10 percent of the vote or higher to be allowed to take part. Libertarian candidates in the debate called for ending government interference in personal, family and business decisions; much lower government spending; deregulation; lower taxes; a currency free of government manipulation; free trade; and a peaceful, non-interventionist foreign policy . Schedule The convention covered five days over May 2–6. The business of deciding the national platform and candidates formally began on May 3, and a second candidate debate was held on May 4. On May 5, the party nominated Gary Johnson as its presidential candidate and Jim Gray as vice presidential candidate. On May 6, elections for the Libertarian National Committee concluded.

He has been a member of the Libertarian Party since 2011 and was the party's nominee in the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. He was also the Libertarian nominee in the 2018 U.S. Senate election in New Mexico . Born in Minot, North Dakota , Johnson attended the University of New Mexico , where he earned a Bachelor of Science . He entered politics for the first time by running for governor of New Mexico in 1994 on a low-tax, anti-crime platform, promising a \"common-sense business approach\". He defeated incumbent Democratic governor Bruce King , 50% to 40%—part of the Republican Revolution that year. He cut the 10% annual growth in the budget, in part by using the gubernatorial veto 200 times during his first six months. He was unable to convince the state senate to pass any of his motions. Johnson sought reelection in 1998 , winning by 55% to 45%. In his second term, he concentrated on the issue of school voucher reforms as well as campaigning for cannabis decriminalization . During his tenure as governor, Johnson adhered to an anti-tax policy, setting state and national records for the number of times he used his veto power: more than the other 49 contemporary governors put together. Term-limited , Johnson retired from front-line politics in 2003. Johnson ran for president in 2012, initially as a Republican on a libertarian platform emphasizing the United States public debt and a balanced budget , protection of civil liberties, military non-interventionism , replacement of income tax with the FairTax , and opposition to the war on drugs . In December 2011, he withdrew his candidacy for the Republican nomination and ran for the Libertarian nomination instead, winning the nomination in May 2012. Johnson received 1.3 million votes (1%), more than all other minor candidates combined. Johnson ran again for President in 2016, once again winning the Libertarian nomination . He named former Republican governor of Massachusetts Bill Weld as his running mate. Johnson received nearly 4.5 million votes (3.3% of the total vote), which is the most for a third-party presidential candidate since 1996 and the highest national vote share for a Libertarian candidate in history. After the 2016 presidential election, Johnson said he would not run for president again. He ran for the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian in the 2018 New Mexico senate race against incumbent Democratic senator Martin Heinrich , coming in third with 15.4% of the statewide vote (107,201 votes).

In the Republican primary, Stewart was described as \"on the very conservative end.\" During the campaign, Stewart drew media attention for his admission that his campaign staff had edited his Wikipedia page to add positive spin, his use of the term \" cuckservative \" in a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" (AMA), and his staunch support for Confederate symbols and monuments. During the campaign, Stewart announced that his campaign would give away an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle for Christmas to highlight his support for gun rights. In a Reddit AMA , Stewart called his GOP primary opponent Ed Gillespie a \"cuckservative\", agreed with a participant who asked if Bill Clinton was a rapist, and wrote \"CONFIRMED!\" to one who asked whether Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe \"is a cuck\". Virginia GOP chairman John Whitbeck rebuked the remarks, calling some of Stewart's language \"racist\", and noted that the term \"cuckservative\" is \"used by white nationalists\". Stewart also said that he and his campaign had been editing his Wikipedia page since at least May 2014 to remove unflattering information and add positive spin, through at least two registered accounts. In May 2017, while speaking at Temple Rodef Shalom in Fairfax County, Stewart blamed progressives in the United States for an uptick in anti-Semitic incidents throughout the United States, saying, \"Today most of the anti-Semitic bigotry is not coming from the right. It's coming from the left. We have to face it.\" In April 2017, Stewart compared the removal of Confederate statues to the atrocities committed by ISIS . He posted on Twitter, \"It appears ISIS has won. They are tearing down historical monuments in New Orleans now too. It must end. Despicable!\" In his defense of Confederate monuments, he compared \"those who wanted to remove the statue to tyrants and Nazis\". Without Confederate symbols, he said at another event, \"we lose our identity\". During the campaign, Stewart distinguished himself among Virginia politicians by not condemning the white supremacists who marched in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017. Stewart said that the counterprotesters at the rally were to blame for \"half the violence\" and he condemned fellow Republicans who expressed disapproval of the white supremacist march. However, Stewart later said, \"I have always condemned the KKK and similar groups.\" During the campaign, Stewart was endorsed by Richard Hines of Save Southern Heritage, a neo-Confederate group. Stewart accepted the endorsement. Stewart consistently defended the Confederate flag and Virginia's \"heritage\" while voicing opposition to any removal of statues honoring Confederate figures. At the Old South Ball in Danville, Virginia, he proclaimed, \"It's the state of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall",

      "text": "Stewart revived the \"birther\" conspiracy theory by suggesting that former president Barack Obama 's birth certificate and Roy Moore accuser Beverly Nelson's yearbook were forgeries. The tweet drew criticism. Following a vote in the Virginia House of Delegates to expand Medicaid in February 2018, Stewart led an event outside the Virginia State Capitol where he held up rolls of toilet paper and called Republicans who voted for the measure \"flaccid\" and \"garbage\". When asked to clarify his comments by the Richmond Times-Dispatch , Stewart replied, \"I'm suggesting I feel sorry for their wives.\" The move brought strong condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans in the House of Delegates. Among those who condemned Stewart's remarks was Republican delegate Glenn Davis , who referred to Stewart in a speech on the House floor as a \"charlatan whose record doesn't match his rhetoric\". Davis' speech drew bipartisan applause from the chamber. Stewart stirred controversy in June 2018 when it was reported that he had praised and paid far-right commentator Paul Nehlen . In January 2017, Stewart called Nehlen one of his \"personal heroes\" and said he was \"inspired\" by Nehlen's attempt to oust House speaker Paul Ryan in a Republican primary. Nehlen had previously made anti-Muslim comments, promoted fringe conspiracy theories and promoted content by white nationalists . In June 2018, five months after Nehlen made controversial anti-Semitic statements, Stewart disavowed Nehlen and said that he no longer considered Nehlen one of his heroes. During the campaign, Stewart sought and received the support of the Public Advocate of the United States , an anti-LGBT group that advocates conversion therapy and compares homosexuality to pedophilia. The founder of the group has claimed that Obama is a \"child molester\" and promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory . Stewart pledged to the group that he would oppose \"'Transgender Bathrooms' legislation and regulations - which have the effect of encouraging and protecting pedophiles\". Stewart also agreed that public schools should be \"prevented from brainwashing elementary school children with the Homosexual Agenda\". Stewart indicated support for overturning Obergefell v. Hodges (the Supreme Court decision that ruled bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional), requiring that schools teach that there are only two genders and granting Christian businesses the right to not service same-sex weddings. During the campaign, Stewart argued that the American Civil War was not about slavery. One of Stewart's top aides has promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory (the debunked far-right theory that senior Democrats operated a child prostitution ring) and the far-right conspiracy that Democrats had DNC staffer Seth Rich murdered . On June 12, 2018, Stewart won the Republican primary. He eventually lost the general election to Democratic incumbent Tim Kaine in a match-up of two Minnesota-born Virginians. Upon winning the primary, Stewart said he had a \"mandate\" to \"kick Tim Kaine's teeth in.\" In a September debate,",
