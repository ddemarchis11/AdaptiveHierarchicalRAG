The volume number (Vol. 87, No. 4) was that of Popular Science but the content was that of World's Advance . The new editor was Waldemar Kaempffert , a former editor of Scientific American . The change in Popular Science Monthly was dramatic. The old version was a scholarly journal that had eight to ten articles in a 100-page issue. There would be ten to twenty photographs or illustrations. The new version had hundreds of short, easy to read articles with hundreds of illustrations. Editor Kaempffert was writing for \"the home craftsman and hobbyist who wanted to know something about the world of science.\" The circulation doubled in the first year. From the mid-1930s to the 1960s, the magazine featured fictional stories of Gus Wilson's Model Garage, centered on car problems. An annual review of changes to the new model year cars ran in 1940 and 1941, but did not return after the war until 1954. It continued until the mid-1970s when the magazine reverted to publishing the new models over multiple issues as information became available. From 1935 to 1949, the magazine sponsored a series of short films , produced by Jerry Fairbanks and released by Paramount Pictures . From July 1952 to December 1989, Popular Science carried Roy Doty 's Wordless Workshop as a regular feature. From July 1969 to May 1989, the cover and table of contents carried the subtitle, \"The What's New Magazine.\" The cover removed the subtitle the following month and the contents page removed it in February 1990. In 1983, the magazine introduced a new logo using the ITC Avant Garde font, which it used until late 1995. Within the next 11 years, its font changed four times (in 1995, 1997, 2001, and 2002, respectively). In 2009, the magazine used a new font for its logo, which was used until the January 2014 issue. In 2014, the magazine underwent a major redesign; its February 2014 issue introduced a new logo, and a new format featuring greater use of graphics and imagery, aiming to broaden its content to appeal to wider attention to the environment, science, and technology among a mass audience. The revamp concluded in November 2014 with a redesign of the Popular Science website. Recent history The Popular Science Publishing Company was acquired in 1967 by the Los Angeles–based Times Mirror Company . In 2000, Times Mirror merged with the Chicago-based Tribune Company , which then sold the Times Mirror magazines to Time Inc. (then a subsidiary of Time Warner ) the following year.

      "text": "Popular Science (also known as PopSci ) is an American popular science website, covering science and technology topics geared toward general readers. Popular Science has won over 58 awards, including the American Society of Magazine Editors awards for its journalistic excellence in 2003 (for General Excellence), 2004 (for Best Magazine Section), and 2019 (for Single-Topic Issue). Its print magazine, which ran from 1872 to 2020, was translated into over 30 languages and distributed to at least 45 countries. In 2021, Popular Science switched to an all-digital format and abandoned the magazine format in 2023. Early history The Popular Science Monthly , as the publication was originally called, was founded in May 1872 by Edward L. Youmans to disseminate scientific knowledge to the educated layman. Youmans had previously worked as an editor for the weekly Appleton's Journal and persuaded them to publish his new journal. Early issues were mostly reprints of English periodicals. The journal became an outlet for writings and ideas of Charles Darwin , Thomas Henry Huxley , Louis Pasteur , Henry Ward Beecher , Charles Sanders Peirce , William James , Thomas Edison , John Dewey and James McKeen Cattell . William Jay Youmans , Edward's brother, helped found Popular Science Monthly in 1872 and was an editor as well. He became editor-in-chief on Edward's death in 1887. The publisher, D. Appleton & Company , was forced to sell the journal for economic reasons in 1900. James McKeen Cattell became the editor in 1900 and the publisher in 1901. Cattell had a background in academics and continued publishing articles for educated readers. By 1915, the readership was declining and publishing a science journal was a financial challenge. In a September 1915 editorial, Cattell related these difficulties to his readers and announced that the Popular Science Monthly name had been transferred to the Modern Publishing Company to start a new publication for general audiences. The existing academic journal would continue publishing under the name The Scientific Monthly , retaining existing subscribers. Scientific Monthly was published until 1958 when it was absorbed into Science . After acquiring the Electrician and Mechanic magazine in 1914, the Modern Publishing Company had merged it with Modern Electrics to become Modern Electrics & Mechanics . Later that year, they merged the publication with Popular Electricity and World's Advance to form Popular Electricity and Modern Mechanics . After further name changes that caused confusion among librarians, the Modern Publishing Company had purchased the Popular Science Monthly name to provide a clear signifier of the publication's focus on popular science.

In January 2016, Popular Science switched to bi-monthly publication after 144 years of monthly publication. In April 2016 it was announced that editor-in-chief Cliff Ransom would be leaving the magazine. In August 2016, Joe Brown was named Popular Science 's new editor-in-chief. In September 2018, it was announced that Popular Science would become a quarterly publication. During his tenure, Popular Science diversified its readership base, was nominated for several National Magazine Awards, winning for The Tiny Issue in 2019, and named to AdWeek ' s Hot List in 2019. Brown stepped down in February 2020. In March 2020, executive editor Corinne Iozzio was named editor-in-chief. During her tenure, the brand moved from a print to a digital-only publication, produced extensive coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, celebrated its 150-year anniversary, and relaunched its \"Brilliant 10\" franchise. Iozzio and her team won a 2022 National Magazine Award for its \"Heat\" issue. The issue, an in-depth look at the stark realities and ingenuity of a warming world, was the second win in the Single-Topic Issue category but the first in its new digital-only format. In August 2022, after more than a decade at Popular Science and two-and-a-half years leading the brand, Iozzio announced that she would step down as editor-in-chief in October of that year. On October 6, 2020, the Bonnier Group sold Popular Science and six other special interest magazines, including the well-known titles Popular Photography , Outdoor Life , and Field & Stream , to North Equity LLC.

However, none of Moskowitz's other new writers lasted in the field, and he rejected McCaffrey's subsequent submissions. As well as fiction, Gernsback included departments such as \"Science Questions and Answers\", \"Science News Shorts\", and other science-related non-fiction; these, like the fiction, were reminiscent of the Gernsback magazines of two decades earlier. In Ashley's opinion, the artwork was of variable quality; Frank R. Paul , who had worked with Gernsback on his earlier magazines, appeared in every issue, but although this brought back the ambience of the early science fiction magazines, Paul's work had not improved over the years. Ashley notes that Alex Schomburg , who was also a frequent contributor, did provide some high-quality covers. Bibliographic details The magazine was subtitled Preview of the Future ; Sam Moskowitz was the managing editor of all seven issues of Science-Fiction Plus , and assembled the issues; Gernsback was listed as editor and wrote the editorials. The magazine remained \"large pulp\" size throughout its run. The first five issues were printed on glossy paper; the final two were pulp. It was priced at 35 cents throughout, and all issues were 64 pages. There are no reprint anthologies from the magazine, nor any foreign editions. In the mid-1950s many stories from Science-Fiction Plus were used in early issues of the Australian magazine Science-Fiction Monthly , with the first four issues almost entirely drawn from Science-Fiction Plus . Several covers and much interior artwork from the magazine were reproduced in a Swedish sf magazine titled Häpna! , which began publication in 1954. References Sources Ashley, Mike (2000).

It was originally published as a humor magazine called The Yellow Kid , based on the popular comic strip character. It was renamed Ainslee's the following year. The magazine's publishers were Howard, Ainslee & Co., a division of the Street & Smith publishing house in New York City. Contributors Among those who contributed essays, short stories, or poetry to Ainslee's : Stephen Crane Arthur Conan Doyle Theodore Dreiser Frances Gaither Maud Hart Lovelace Bret Harte O.

Wylie From 1920 to 1923 Dorothy Parker wrote the monthly drama reviews column, \"In Broadway Playhouses\". Edith Isaacs worked as a critic for the magazine prior to her tenure at Theatre Arts . Ainslee's was published until December 1926, after which it was merged into Far West Illustrated , a western-fiction magazine. In 1934, Street & Smith revived Ainslee's Magazine as a \"sophisticated love-story monthly\" edited by Daisy Bacon . In 1936, the title changed to Ainslee’s Smart Love Stories , then finally Smart Love Stories . It was discontinued in 1938.

Gernsback hired Sam Moskowitz to edit the new magazine, and produced a dummy issue in November 1952 that was never distributed or intended for sale; it was printed for trademark purposes, and contained only stories by Gernsback himself, under his own name and several pseudonyms. The first issue produced for sale was dated March 1953. It was a slick , meaning that it was in large format and was printed on high-quality paper; this was a step up from the cheap paper used in the leading science fiction magazines of the day, and sf historian Mike Ashley notes that in theory this should have given Gernsback a marketing edge. The price, 35 cents, was also competitive. Sales were initially good, and Science-Fiction Plus remained on a monthly schedule until June, but when the circulation began to slip, the magazine became bimonthly beginning with the August issue. Gernsback distributed Science-Fiction Plus along with his technical magazines, and if the circulation of the new magazine had been comparable to that of his other titles, it would have been profitable despite the more expensive slick paper, but sales were insufficient for it to continue. In October Gernsback cut costs by switching to cheaper pulp paper, but only one further issue, dated December 1953, appeared. Contents and reception Frank R. Paul 's cover for the last issue (December 1953) of Science-Fiction Plus Gernsback believed from the beginning of his involvement with science fiction in the 1920s that the stories should be instructive, although it was not long before he found it necessary to print fantastical and unscientific fiction in Amazing Stories to attract readers. During Gernsback's long absence from sf publishing, from 1936 to 1953, the field evolved away from his focus on facts and education. The Golden Age of Science Fiction is generally considered to have started in the late 1930s and lasted until the mid-1940s, bringing with it \"a quantum jump in quality, perhaps the greatest in the history of the genre\", according to science fiction historians Peter Nicholls and Mike Ashley. However, Gernsback's views were unchanged. In his editorial in the first issue of Science-Fiction Plus , he gave his view of the modern sf story: \"the fairy tale brand, the weird or fantastic type of what mistakenly masquerades under the name of Science-Fiction today!\" and he stated his preference for \"truly scientific, prophetic Science-Fiction with the full accent on SCIENCE\". In the same editorial, Gernsback called for patent reform to give science fiction authors the right to create patents for ideas without having patent models because many of their ideas predated the technical progress needed to develop specifications for their ideas. The introduction referenced the numerous prescient technologies described throughout Ralph 124C 41+ . The managing editor, Sam Moskowitz,",
