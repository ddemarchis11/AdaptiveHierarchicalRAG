      "text": "Rub-A-Dub-Dub was a British television series animated by Peter Lang and Alan Rogers of the Cut-Out Animation Co. They were previously famous for Pigeon Street . The series was produced by David Yates and Joe Wolf. The title is a reference to the nursery rhyme Rub-a-dub-dub . Rub-A-Dub-Dub was animated in a similar way, yet all the characters were anthropomorphic animals. It ran in 1984, completing 25 episodes. Episode structure The episodes usually started off with the character Mother Goose and (most often) another character stood by a polka-dot patterned bathtub, with Mother Goose saying \"Rub-a-dub-dub...\" announcing that there was an item in the tub, an item that will then be relevant to the episode, e.g. \"Rub-a-dub-dub, there's a kettle in the tub...\" The line would then usually be followed up by another. In this case, the character King Crow appears at the window and says \"...And King Crow wants his tea!\" The nursery rhymes themselves, performed by Madeline Bell and John Telfer, would be dotted in amongst the humorous dialogue between the animal characters. Characters Principal characters Mother Goose : Could be considered the hostess of Rub-A-Dub-Dub. She begins every episode by saying \"Rub-a-dub-dub, there's a... in the tub.\" She is a white goose, wearing what looks to be a yellow raincoat and hat, a blue skirt beneath the coat and blue shoes. She also wears pink tights with white spots. Polly : An irritable parrot. Their gender is ambiguous, as the song \" Little Poll Parrot \" refers to them with male pronouns while the song \"Mrs. Mason Bought A Basin\" refers to them with female pronouns. They often get annoyed with various characters, such as with Mother Goose when she asks them to make King Crow's tea . In this instance, they respond \"I'm not gonna make it! Why does it always have to be me!? Humph!\" They also often appear to be on the receiving end of bad luck, such as when they set their dinner down before the television, leave to get a drink, and then find their dinner has been stolen, to which they respond: \"EH! Where did it go?!\" Polly had a red face and blue hands and legs, wore a green jumper with red sleeves and yellow shoes. King Crow : The King who is a crow. He was awfully demanding of his servants such as Polly, on whom he intrudes into their TV-watching time, saying \"Hello Polly, get me my pipe and bowl please! \" He was also awfully energetic and bounced around a lot. Like all crows, King Crow was black with a yellow beak. He wore a stereotypical King's robe and crown, black and white striped stockings and black-and-white shoes. Queen Duck : The wife of King Crow.",

      "text": "\" The Titanic \" (also known as \" It Was Sad When That Great Ship Went Down \" and \" Titanic (Husbands and Wives) \") is a folk song and children's song . \"The Titanic\" is about the sinking of RMS Titanic which sank on April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg. Background History The first folk songs about the Titanic disaster appeared within weeks after the disaster. Recordings of various songs about the disaster date to as early as 1913. Variants The canonical version of the song has the chorus: It was sad when that great ship went down Husbands and wives and little children lost their lives It was sad when that great ship went down In most variants, although not the earliest, the chorus starts with a line \"it was sad, so sad, it was sad\", and in many versions, the line \"to the bottom of the...\" appended after the repeat of \"went down.\" Other than the chorus, different versions may contain verses in different order. There are several regional variations on the song. According to Newman I. White's 1928 book American Negro Folk-Songs , \"The Titanic\" has been traced back to 1915 or 1916 in Hackleburg, Alabama . Other versions from around 1920 are documented in the Frank C. Brown Collection at Duke University in North Carolina . Early recordings include Ernest Stoneman 's \"The Titanic\" (Okeh 40288) in September 1924 and William and Versey Smith's \"When That Great Ship Went Down\" in August 1927. According to Jeff Place, in his notes for the Anthology of American Folk Music : \"African-American musicians, in particular, found it noteworthy and ironic that company policies had kept Blacks from the doomed ship; the sinking was also attributed by some to divine retribution.\" Recordings Mance Lipscomb on Texas Songster Volume 2 (You Got to Reap What You Sow) 1964 References Works cited Habing, B.
