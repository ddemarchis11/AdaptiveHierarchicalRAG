Serving as a sound box , a reversed calabash is placed on the curved part of the bow on the ground. To hold the whole, the player presses her knee on the container. With the fingers of the left hand, as with the imzad , she defines the melody, while with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, she grip the string with a regular gesture vibrate. At present, the ahardin, an instrument whose manufacture is easily improvised, is considered above all as a game of girls.

They are the single largest ethnic group in Namibia , accounting for about half of the population. Despite concerted efforts from Christian missionaries to wipe out what they believed to be 'pagan practices', the Ovambo have retained many aspects of their traditional cultural practices. They are also found in the southern Angolan province of Cunene , where they are more commonly referred to as \"Ambo\". The Ovambo consist of a number of kindred Bantu ethnic tribes who inhabit what was formerly called Ovamboland . In Angola, they are a minority, accounting for about two percent of the total Angolan population. In the early 21st century, the Ovambo ethnic group numbered about 2 million people. They are predominantly of the Lutheran (97%) and traditional faiths (3%), the former having followed conversion by German missionaries. Demographics Ovambo people distribution (approx). The Ovambo people reside in the flat sandy grassy plains of north Namibia and the Cunene Province in southwestern Angola , sometimes referred to as Ovamboland. These plains are generally flat, without many stones, and located at a high altitude. Water courses, known as oshanas , irrigate the area. In the northern regions of Ovamboland, tropical vegetation is sustained by abundant but seasonal rainfall that floods the region, creating temporary lakes and islands. In dry season, these pools of water empty out. The Ovambo have adapted to the widely varying seasonal weather patterns with their housing, agriculture, and livestock practices. The Ovambo people are a Bantu-speaking group. In Namibia, these are the AaNdonga, Ovakwanyama, Aakwambi, Aangandjera, Aambalantu, Ovaunda, Aakolonkadhi, Aakwaluudhi and Aambandja. In Angola, they are the Ovakwanyama, Aakafima, Evale and Aandonga. The Ovakwanyama are the largest sub-tribe. History The Ovambo started migrating to their current location around the 14th century from the Zambia region to the northeast. They settled near the Angola-Namibia border, with expansion further south into Namibia in the 17th century. They have a close cultural, linguistic and historical relationship to the Herero people , who are found in more southern parts of Namibia, and Kavango people to their east,",

He pointed out that the name for the Greek lute, pandura was likely derived from pan-tur , a Sumerian word meaning \"small bow.\" He considered this evidence in support of the theory that the musical bow was ancestral to the pierced lute. The bows used for music required a resonator, a hollowed object like a bowl, a gourd, or a musician's mouth, in order to produce audible sound. Although the musical bow could be manipulated to produce more than one tone, instruments were developed from it that used one note per string. Since each string played a single note, adding strings added new notes for instrument families such as bow harps , harps, and lyres. In turn, this led to being able to play dyads and chords . Another innovation occurred when the bow harp was straightened out and a bridge used to lift the strings off the stick-neck , creating the lute. Musical bows are still used in a number of cultures today. It can be found as far south as Eswatini , and as far east as eastern Africa, Madagascar , and Réunion . and also outside of Africa, as in the case of berimbau , malunga (derivations of the African musical bow) or the Appalachian mouth-bow . Playing ways The usual way to make the bow sound is to pluck the string, although sometimes a subsidiary bow is used to scrape the string, much as on a violin . The Onavillu of Kerala sounds when struck with a thin stick. Unlike string instruments used in classical music , however, they do not have a built-in resonator, although resonators may be made to work with the bow in a number of ways. The most usual type of resonator consists of a gourd attached to the back of the string bearer. The bow may also be stood in a pit or gourd on the ground, or one end of it may be partially placed in the mouth. This last method allows the size of the resonator to be varied as the instrument is played, thus allowing a melody to be heard consisting of the notes resonating in the player's mouth. As well as these various forms of resonators, the bow is frequently played without a resonator at all. In Africa, the musical bow is usually played by a solo performer. In capoeira , the berimbau is played as part of the roda, a musical group standing in a circle, in the centre of which the capoeiristas perform or play. The Appalachian mouth-bow can be played amplified in old-time music jams. In Africa See : Uhadi musical bow See : Umuduri The Uhadi or 'thomo' musical bow used by the Basotho people.

Problems playing this file? See media help . The musical bow ( bowstring or string bow , a subset of bar zithers ) is a simple string instrument used by a number of African peoples as well as Indigenous peoples of the Americas. It consists of a flexible, usually wooden, stick 1.5 to 10 feet (0.5 to 3 m) long, and strung end to end with a taut cord, usually metal. It can be played with the hands or a wooden stick or branch. It is uncertain if the musical bow developed from the hunting bow , though the San or Bushmen people of the Kalahari Desert do convert their hunting bows to musical use. Types of bow include mouth-resonated string bow, earth-resonated string bow , and gourd-resonated string bow. History India, ca. 1725, Bundi style. A divine musician plays a hunting bow with its tip placed in a resonance pot. Possible pinaka vina or ravanahatha . Lithograph of scene from the Trois Frères cave , showing a figure on the wall whose bow(?) has been thought to possibly be musical. There is speculation that the hunting bow may have been used as a musical instrument from as early as circa 13,000 B.C. Henri Breuil surveyed the Trois Frères in France caves and made an engraving that attempted to reproduce a c. 13,000 B.C. cave painting into a black-and-white lithograph engraving. His engraving showed a mysterious figure, a \"man camouflaged to resemble a bison,\" in the midst of a mass of herd-animals, \"herding the beasts and playing the musical bow.\" The artwork is confused, and those who are trying to reproduce the art in color have had to work to bring out legible images. One interpretation of the \"magician-hunter\" image considers his hunting-bow to be a musical bow, used as a single-stringed musical instrument. Whether the bow in the cave illustration is a musical instrument or the hunting tool in a Paleolithic hunt, musicologists have considered whether the bow could be a possible relative or ancestor to the chordophone : the lute , lyre , harp , and zither family. Curt Sachs said that there was good reason not to consider hunters' bows as likely musical bows. One reason was that the oldest known musical bows were 10 feet long, useless for hunting, and that \"musical bows were not associated with hunters' beliefs and ceremonies.\" Sachs considered the musical bows important, however. He pointed out that the name for the Greek lute, pandura was likely derived from pan-tur , a Sumerian word meaning \"small",

      "text": "Ground bow dyulu tama in Fouta Djallon region of Guinea, 1908 The ground-bow , also known as an earth-bow or ground harp , is a single-string bow-shaped folk musical instrument, classified as a chordophone . It is known in cultures of equatorial and south Africa, and in other cultures with African roots. It consists of a flexible stick planted into the ground (possibly a stripped sapling or a branch ), with a string from its free end to a resonator of some kind based on a pit in the ground. It looks like a game trap or a child toy, therefore its distribution over Africa used to be overlooked. Hornbostel (1933) classified is in the category of harps , although it has combined characteristics of a harp and a musical bow . The resonator may be a pit covered by a board, with string attached to it. Kruges describes several other constructions by Venda, e.g., the other end of a string is tied to a stone dropped into the pit, with string passing through the board covering the pit, etc. Other names include kalinga or galinga by Venda people . In their language \"galinga\" means simply a hole in the ground, while the origins of \"kalinga\" are uncertain. It is known as gayumba in Haiti , Dominican Republic , and tumbandera in Haitian traditions of Cuba . Baka people call it angbindi . It is also known in Cuba under the onomatopoeic name tingo-talango ( tingotalango ). Julio Cueva 's song Tingo Talango dedicated to this musical instrument describes its construction thus: Si quieren que les describa cómo es el tingo talango tráiganme un gajo de güira o si no uno de mango. Se abre un hueco en el suelo, encima una hoja de lata, en el centro un agujero donde un alambre se ata. Translation: If you want me to describe how is the tingo talango bring me a slice of güira or if not, one of mango. A hole opens in the ground a tin sheet on top, in the center a hole where a wire is tied. Tingo Talango is also the song by Ñico Lora . The instrument is reportedly nearly-extinct in the native cultures. Playing techniques Kalinga may be struck by a stick or plucked in various ways. The bow stick may be bent to change the tension of the string, and hence the tone. It can be played in a glissando manner: the stick is bent, struck, and released, producing a peculiar sound. The produced pitches are not always stable. Kalinga is usually played to provide repetitive accompaniment to the choral song.

In conjunction with the armed SWAPO movement, Namibia and its Ovambo people gained independence from South Africa in 1990. Religion Traditional religion The traditional religion of the Ovambo people is the primary faith of less than 3%. In the 21st century, most state Christianity as their primary faith. The Ovambo's traditional religion envisions a supreme being named Kalunga , with their rites and rituals centered around sacred fire . This is similar to religious traditions of many ethnic groups in southwestern Africa. The Kalunga cosmology states that the Supreme Being created the first man and first woman, who had a daughter and two sons. It is the daughter's lineage that created the Ovambo people. Their traditional beliefs are expressed through their matrilineal kinship system . The rituals involve elaborate fire making and keeping ceremonies, a rain making dance, and the use of herbs and smoke. Certain rites include throwing herbs in the fire and inhaling the rising smoke. The head priest traditionally was the king of a tribe. His role in part was to attend to the supernatural spirits and be the chief representative of the Ovambo tribe to the deities. Christianity A Lutheran church in Ongwediva . Christianity arrived among the Ovambo people in the late 19th century. The first Finnish missionaries arrived in Ovamboland in the 1870s. They were Lutheran and influenced the conversion of Ovambo people to that Protestant faith. The Finnish missions influenced both religion and cultural practices. For example, the typical dress style of contemporary Ovambo women, which includes a head scarf and loose full-length maxi, was derived from those of the 19th-century Finnish missionaries. The Ovambo now predominantly follow Christian theology, prayer rituals and festivities. Some traditional religious practices have continued, such as the use of ritual sacred fire. They also invoke their supreme creator Kalunga . Thus, the Ovamba have adopted a syncretic form of Christianity. Most weddings, for instance, feature a combination of Christian beliefs and Ovambo traditions. Their traditional dancing is done to drumming (Oshiwambo folk music).  Society and culture Huts of the Ovambo people, and their artwork (right). The traditional home is a complex of huts surrounded by a fence of large vertical poles linked by two horizontal poles on each side.

The Umuduri musical bow used in Burundi and Rwanda is similar to the Uhadi bow of South Africa. Two bows in which the resonator is a gourd, attached to the instrument's center and pressed into the musician's chest or stomach. Both are sounded with a stick. Due to the nature of their construction and playing, musical bows are quiet instruments, therefore needing a resonator to resound. The resonator can either be a gourd (as in uhadi , umakhweyana , segankure , xitende , berimbau , etc.) or the player's mouth (as in umrhubhe , umqangala , tshihwana , xizambi , etc.) Musical bows are the main instruments of the Nguni and Sotho people, the predominant peoples of South Africa. Historians believe that many of the musical bows came from Khoisan peoples. Although there are many differences between musical bows, all of them share two things: a resonator, and at least two fundamental notes. The strongest notes are the fundamentals , the deepest notes produced by the string, whereas the higher notes (the harmonic partials ) are produced by the resonator. There are at least two fundamental notes produced by all musical bows, an open (when the player does not shorten it or touch it) and a closed (where the string is shortened or stopped by the player's hand). In Xhosa they are called vu (from the word Vuliwe , 'open') and ba (from Banjiwe , 'held') respectively. These two notes can already be on the string, if it is divided or stopped by a string attached to the gourd, as in the case of umakhweyana , xitende , berimbau , hungu , etc. The pitch difference between a vu and a ba is usually about a whole tone . In certain places, it can be closer to a semitone (e.g. Zulu) or closer to a minor third (Tsonga). Some of those instruments have more than two notes, for example the Zulu umakhweyana and the Tsonga xitende have three, whereas the Venda tshihwana has four.

In drier regions or seasons, pastoral activity with herds of cattle ( eengobe / eenghwandabi ), goats ( iikombo / onakamela ) and sheep ( eedi ) becomes more important. The animal husbandry is not for meat ( ombelela ), but primarily as a source of milk ( omashini ). Their food is supplemented by hunting, fishing, and gathering.

In 1895 Banjo Paterson, holidaying in outback Queensland, heard Christina Macpherson play a tune she had memorised from a Warrnambool race-meeting band; he fashioned the bush-ballad lyrics about a swagman, a jumbuck and a fatal confrontation at a billabong. Within months the song was being sung in station homesteads, but its popular melody and familiar chorus were fixed only after tea merchant James Inglis bought the rights in 1903 and had Marie Cowan shorten, polish and harmonise it for an advertising jingle for Billy Tea. Subsequent copyright claims, international royalty disputes and countless recordings turned the once-local bush song into the world’s most-recorded piece of Australian music.  \n\n**Keywords:** Waltzing Matilda, Banjo Paterson, Christina Macpherson, Marie Cowan, Australian folk song",
