    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The model correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information relevant to the question. However, the model fails to provide the correct answer, 'WikiLeaks,' which is not dependent on the retrieved context but could have been generated from internal knowledge. The retrieved context does not support the answer, so faithfulness is rated high, but correctness and evidence coverage are rated low."
