    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about the British actress described in the question. However, the Model Answer does not address the question directly or provide the correct answer, 'Tamzin Outhwaite,' which is not found in the context. Therefore, the answer is incorrect, but it is faithful to the context as it does not make unsupported claims. Evidence coverage is 0.0 because the Model Answer does not include the key fact from the Gold Answer."
