  "question": "Between the frontman of an American extreme metal band active since the 2000s and the co-founder of a seminal British psychedelic rock group who suffered a mental health breakdown, which artist is credited with a broader range of roles and activities?",
  "gold_answer": "Gregory John \"Greg\" Puciato",
  "llm_answer": "The context only provides detailed information about Syd Barrett, co-founder of Pink Floyd, noting he was a singer, guitarist, songwriter, and later a painter and gardener. It does not give comparable detail about the American extreme-metal frontman, so we cannot determine from the given text which artist had the broader range of roles and activities.",
