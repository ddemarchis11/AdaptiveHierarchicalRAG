  "question": "Between two Canadian gold mines — one located in the Northwest Territories and the other in northern Ontario — which began operations earlier?",
  "gold_answer": "Kanichee Mine",
  "llm_answer": "The Salmita Mine in the Northwest Territories began operations in 1983. The context does not provide any information about the start date of a gold mine in northern Ontario, so we cannot determine which began earlier.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies the Salmita Mine as the answer, while the Gold Answer specifies Kanichee Mine. The context does not provide information about Kanichee Mine, but the Model Answer fails to address the correct mine or compare the two mines as required by the question. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context regarding Salmita Mine's operational start date, it does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
