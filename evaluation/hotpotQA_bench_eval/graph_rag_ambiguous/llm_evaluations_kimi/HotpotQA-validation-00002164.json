    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about John Eric Holmes's academic position, which is faithful to the context. However, it fails to answer the question correctly, as the Gold Answer specifies the University of Southern California, which is not mentioned in the retrieved context. The Model Answer does not include the key fact from the Gold Answer, resulting in low evidence coverage and incorrectness."
