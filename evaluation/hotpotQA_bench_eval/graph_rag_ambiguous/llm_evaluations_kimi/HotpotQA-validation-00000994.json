    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the familial relation as 'great-grandfather,' matching the Gold Answer. However, the Retrieved Context does not provide any information about Fred Gehrke or his connection to Christian Yelich, making the answer ungrounded and unsupported by the context. Additionally, the Model Answer introduces Fred Gehrke, which is not mentioned in the context, resulting in no evidence coverage."
