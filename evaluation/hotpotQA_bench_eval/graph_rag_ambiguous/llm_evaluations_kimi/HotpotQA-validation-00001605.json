  "question": "An American fringe inventor working in the early twentieth century reportedly built upon nuclear battery research published in 1912 by which English physicist, who died young during the First World War?",
  "gold_answer": "Henry Moseley",
  "llm_answer": "The provided context does not mention any English physicist who published nuclear battery research in 1912 and died young in WWI, so I cannot identify the person from these sources.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about the English physicist in question. However, it fails to answer the user's query, which is explicitly about Henry Moseley, as stated in the Gold Answer. The retrieved context is irrelevant to the question, so the model's inability to answer is grounded in the context but does not meet the requirements of the question."
