    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct episode number (278th) as stated in the Gold Answer. It also does not utilize any relevant information from the retrieved context to address the question, and instead states that the context does not specify the episode number, which is incorrect. The response neither answers the question nor aligns with the Gold Answer or the context."
