    "explanation": "The model answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about the English entertainer with the specified birth name or production title. However, it fails to answer the question directly, which is asking for the full birth name of Michael Patrick Smith. The retrieved context does not contain relevant information to support the Gold Answer, so the model's response is faithful to the context but does not address the question or include the required facts."
