  "question": "What was the nationality of the heavyset comedic actor who portrayed an Eastern European captor in a 1994 made-for-TV comedy about a kidnapping gone wrong?",
  "gold_answer": "Canadian",
  "llm_answer": "The context does not identify any heavyset comedic actor who played an Eastern European captor in a 1994 made-for-TV comedy about a kidnapping gone wrong, so the nationality cannot be determined from the provided information.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the context does not provide information about the actor or their nationality, making it faithful to the context. However, it fails to answer the question correctly, as the Gold Answer specifies the nationality as Canadian, which is not addressed in the Model Answer. Additionally, the Model Answer does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
