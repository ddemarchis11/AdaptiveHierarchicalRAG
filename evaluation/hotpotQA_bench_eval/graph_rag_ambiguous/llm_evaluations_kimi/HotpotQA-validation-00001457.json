  "question": "In the sequence of Viennese reform operas by the same eighteenth-century composer, which work immediately preceded the one that received its premiere before the Habsburg empress?",
  "gold_answer": "Alceste",
  "llm_answer": "The context does not specify any earlier Viennese reform opera by Gluck that directly precedes *Orfeo ed Euridice*, so the work that immediately preceded it in this sequence cannot be identified from the given information.",
  "scores": {

    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct response ('Alceste') and does not utilize the retrieved context effectively to address the question. It incorrectly states that the context does not specify the preceding opera, despite the Gold Answer being clear and concise. The retrieved context does not directly support the Model Answer's claim, leading to a lack of faithfulness and evidence coverage."
