  "question": "How many members made up the blues rock band that the British guitarist fronted immediately before releasing his 1975 live concert album?",
  "gold_answer": "four",
  "llm_answer": "The context does not specify which British guitarist or which 1975 live concert album is being referred to, so the number of band members cannot be determined from the provided information.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The model answer fails to address the question directly and does not provide the correct number of band members (four). It also incorrectly states that the context does not specify relevant information, despite the retrieved context containing details about bands and their members. The model answer neither aligns with the gold answer nor utilizes the context effectively."
