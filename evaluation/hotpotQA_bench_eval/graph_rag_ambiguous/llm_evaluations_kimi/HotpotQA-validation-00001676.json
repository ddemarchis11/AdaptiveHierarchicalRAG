  "question": "Between a genus of flowering shrubs and small trees distributed across tropical and subtropical regions worldwide and a genus of trees and shrubs known for their fragrant resinous bark, which encompasses the greater number of species?",
  "gold_answer": "Myrsine",
  "llm_answer": "The context does not mention any genus of trees and shrubs known for fragrant resinous bark, so we cannot compare it.  \nThe only genus described as having worldwide tropical/subtropical distribution is Myrsine, which contains over 280 species.  \nTherefore, based solely on the provided information, Myrsine is the genus with the greater number of species.",
