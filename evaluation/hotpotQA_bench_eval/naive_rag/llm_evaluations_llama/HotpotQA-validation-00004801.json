  "question": "What North Carolina native did Danja produce songs for?",
  "gold_answer": "J. Cole",

    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect because the Gold Answer ('J. Cole') is definitive and does not require further evidence from the context. While the context does not explicitly mention J. Cole, the Model Answer fails to provide the correct response based on internal knowledge, leading to a score of 0.0 for correctness and evidence coverage. However, the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, as it accurately reflects the lack of relevant information in the provided context."
