  "question": "Are Staten Island Catapult and This Is Elvis both documentaries?",
  "gold_answer": "yes",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, I can answer the question as follows:\n\n- Staten Island Catapult: There is no information in the provided evidence about a documentary called \"Staten Island Catapult.\" It is possible that this is a different topic or a different title, but based on the provided evidence, I cannot confirm whether it is a documentary or not.\n\n- This Is Elvis: This Is Elvis is mentioned in the provided evidence as a film, but it does not explicitly state that it is a documentary. However, it is listed on IMDb and the TCM Movie Database, which are typically used for films, and it is also listed on Rotten Tomatoes, which is a review aggregation website for films. Based on this information, it is likely that This Is Elvis is a documentary, but the provided evidence does not explicitly confirm this.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question correctly. It does not confirm that both 'Staten Island Catapult' and 'This Is Elvis' are documentaries, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide any relevant information about either title, making the Model Answer ungrounded and unsupported. The Gold Answer is concise and correct, but the Model Answer does not align with it or provide evidence-based reasoning."
