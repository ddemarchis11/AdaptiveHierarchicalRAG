  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not explicitly mention the three core subjects of the education tradition at St. John's College, Belize. However, it fails to answer the user's question directly, which is about grammar, logic, and rhetoric being the core subjects. The Gold Answer provides this information, but the Model Answer does not address it, leading to a score of 0.0 for correctness and evidence coverage. Faithfulness is rated 1.0 as the Model Answer is accurate in stating the lack of explicit evidence in the context."
