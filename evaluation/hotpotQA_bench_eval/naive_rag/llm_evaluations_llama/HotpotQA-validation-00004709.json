  "question": "Which band did this American businessman, music publisher, writers' representative, filmmaker and record label executive manage while simultaneously managing this group of the album \"More Hot Rocks?\"",
  "gold_answer": "the Beatles",
  "llm_answer": "Insufficient evidence to answer the question.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect because the context explicitly mentions that Allen Klein managed both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones simultaneously. The Gold Answer correctly identifies the Beatles, but the Model Answer fails to provide any relevant information or address the question. While the Model Answer does not contradict the context, it does not utilize the available evidence to form a correct response."
