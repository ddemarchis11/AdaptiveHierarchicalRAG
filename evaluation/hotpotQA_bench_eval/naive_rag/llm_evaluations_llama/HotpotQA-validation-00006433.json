    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the single was recorded in 1983, which is consistent with the context. However, the Gold Answer specifies that the recording occurred before the band settled on their current name in 1982, which is a more nuanced detail. The Model Answer misses this nuance, leading to partial correctness and evidence coverage."
