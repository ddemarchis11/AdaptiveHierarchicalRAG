    "answer_correctness": 1.0,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the Van cat's eyes exhibit complete heterochromia, which is consistent with the context. However, it does not explicitly mention 'odd-eyed,' which is the specific term used in the Gold Answer and the context. While the answer is correct and faithful, it misses the key term 'odd-eyed,' reducing evidence coverage."
