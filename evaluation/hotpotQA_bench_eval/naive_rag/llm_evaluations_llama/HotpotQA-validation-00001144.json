    "answer_correctness": 0.5,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Peter Guber as the co-producer of the 1989 Batman film alongside Jon Peters, which is supported by the context. However, it does not address the specific part of the question regarding Peter Guber's role as CEO of Mandalay Entertainment, which is the core of the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it misses the key factual point about Mandalay Entertainment."
