  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that both Edgar Selwyn and Chantal Akerman work in the film industry, which is supported by the context. However, it misses the fact that Edgar Selwyn also worked in theater, as indicated in the Gold Answer. The retrieved context provides evidence for both individuals' involvement in film but does not explicitly mention Selwyn's theater work, which affects evidence coverage. Faithfulness is high as all claims are grounded in the context."
