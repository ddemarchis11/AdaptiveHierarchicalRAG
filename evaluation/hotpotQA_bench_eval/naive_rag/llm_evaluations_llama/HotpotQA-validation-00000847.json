    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect as the Gold Answer clearly identifies 'cocktails' as the category for Polar Bear and Daiquiri. The Retrieved Context does not provide relevant information about cocktails, but the Model Answer fails to use internal knowledge to provide the correct answer. Thus, the answer is incorrect, but it remains faithful to the context provided."
