    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies David Fincher as the director of 'Girl 6,' which is not supported by the context or the question. The correct director is Spike Lee, and the Model Answer fails to provide any relevant information about Spike Lee's filmography since 1983. Additionally, the retrieved context does not contain information about Spike Lee or his films, making the answer unfaithful and lacking evidence coverage."
