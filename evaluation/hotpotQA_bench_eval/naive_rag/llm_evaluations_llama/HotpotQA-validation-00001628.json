    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Tim Cluess as the head coach who led his team for a longer period of time, consistent with the Gold Answer. It provides evidence from the context, noting Cluess's tenure as fifth and sixth-year head coach at Iona, while Prohm's tenure is less clear but includes his first year at Iowa State. All claims are grounded in the retrieved context, and the key fact (Cluess led longer) is covered."
