    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states 'The Boys' as the comic book written by the writer of Crossed, while the Gold Answer specifies 'Preacher.' The retrieved context does not support the claim about 'The Boys' being the correct answer, nor does it mention 'Preacher,' making the Model Answer both incorrect and unfaithful to the context."
