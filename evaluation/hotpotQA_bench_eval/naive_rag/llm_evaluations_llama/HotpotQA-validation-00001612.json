    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that KSCW-DT is part of a duopoly with virtual channel 12 in Wichita, but it does not explicitly name KWCH-DT, which is the specific station mentioned in the Gold Answer. The Retrieved Context supports the relationship between KSCW-DT and KWCH-DT, making the answer faithful to the context. However, the lack of explicit mention of KWCH-DT reduces evidence coverage and correctness."
