  "gold_answer": "Donald J. Trump's private jet",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, I can answer the question as follows:\n\nThe private jet called Trump Force One is a Boeing 757, not a Boeing Commercial Airplanes aircraft built from 1981 to 2004. The Boeing 757 was produced from 1982 to 2004.\n\nThe Trump Organization's Boeing 757, nicknamed Trump Force One, is an aircraft owned and operated by Donald Trump. The 757 was built in 1991 and was originally delivered to Denmark's Sterling Airlines. It was later operated by Mexico's TAESA and then became a corporate jet for Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's enterprises in 1995. Trump's DJT Operations I LLC bought the plane in 2011.\n\nThe Boeing 757 is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft, but it was not built from 1981 to 2004. The production of the 757 peaked at an annual rate of 100 aircraft in the early 1990s, and it ended in October 2004.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that the Trump Force One is a Boeing 757, but it was not built from 1981 to 2004.",
