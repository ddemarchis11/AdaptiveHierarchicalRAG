  "question": "Which one of the Long Island Herald newspaper chain serves a village in Nassau County, New York with a population of 6,483?",
  "gold_answer": "The Nassau Herald",
  "llm_answer": "Insufficient evidence to determine which Long Island Herald newspaper chain serves a village in Nassau County, New York with a population of 6,483.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct response, which is 'The Nassau Herald,' as stated in the Gold Answer. The retrieved context clearly supports this answer by describing The Nassau Herald as serving the Five Towns communities, including Lawrence, a village in Nassau County with a population close to the one mentioned in the question. The Model Answer incorrectly claims insufficient evidence, despite the context providing sufficient information."
