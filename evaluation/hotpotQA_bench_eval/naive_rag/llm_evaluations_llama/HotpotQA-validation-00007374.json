    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed description of the diet advocated by Joel Fuhrman, including its vegetarian, vegan, low-salt, low-fat, and gluten-free aspects, as well as its restrictive nature. However, it does not explicitly emphasize the 'micronutrient-rich' aspect, which is the core of the Gold Answer. While the details are faithful to the context, the omission of the key term 'micronutrient-rich' reduces evidence coverage and correctness."
