    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the nickname 'King of Cool' is not explicitly mentioned in the retrieved context, which is faithful to the evidence provided. However, it fails to answer the question correctly using external knowledge, as Dean Martin is widely known by the nickname 'King of Cool.' The Gold Answer is not addressed, and the key fact is missed."
