    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct birth year (1895) of Walter Dornberger, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context contains relevant information about Operation Lighthouse and Walter Dornberger, but the Model Answer does not utilize this context to address the question. Therefore, it is incorrect, ungrounded, and lacks evidence coverage."
