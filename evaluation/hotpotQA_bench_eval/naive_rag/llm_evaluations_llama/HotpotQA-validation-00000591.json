    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies 'pro-Confederate' as the group, while the Model Answer identifies 'Quantrill's Raiders.' Although Quantrill's Raiders were indeed pro-Confederate, the Model Answer does not directly align with the Gold Answer's phrasing. The context supports the mention of Quantrill's Raiders, making the Model Answer faithful to the context, but it fails to match the Gold Answer's core fact and misses the specific terminology 'pro-Confederate.'"
