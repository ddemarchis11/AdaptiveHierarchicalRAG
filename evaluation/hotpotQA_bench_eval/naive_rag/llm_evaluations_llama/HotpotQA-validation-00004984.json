    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies 'radionuclides' as one of the categories, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces additional categories like 'radioactive isotopes,' 'fission products,' and 'primordial isotopes,' which are not explicitly supported by the retrieved context for caesium-137, radium, and uranium-234. While 'radioactive isotopes' and 'radionuclides' are closely related, the inclusion of 'fission products' and 'primordial isotopes' is partially correct but not fully grounded in the context provided. The evidence coverage is partial as the core fact 'radionuclides' is mentioned but diluted by other unsupported claims."
