    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states 'The University of Chicago' as the university where Thomas Szasz served most of his career as a professor of psychiatry. The Gold Answer and the Retrieved Context clearly indicate that it was the State University of New York Upstate Medical University. The Model Answer is neither correct nor faithful to the context, and it fails to cover the key fact provided in the Gold Answer."
