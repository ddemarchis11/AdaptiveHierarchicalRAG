  "gold_answer": "128 pages",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct number of pages (128) as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the Retrieved Context does not contain information directly addressing the question, but the Model Answer does not utilize internal knowledge to answer correctly either. Therefore, it is incorrect, ungrounded, and lacks evidence coverage."
