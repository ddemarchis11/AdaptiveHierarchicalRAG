    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide a definitive answer to the question, which is clearly stated in the Gold Answer as Sheridan County being farther west. The retrieved context provides sufficient geographical information to determine that Sheridan County, Montana (located at 104°30′W) is farther west than Chandra Taal (located in Himachal Pradesh, India, at approximately 77°E). The Model Answer neither utilizes the context nor aligns with the Gold Answer, resulting in a complete failure in correctness, faithfulness, and evidence coverage."
