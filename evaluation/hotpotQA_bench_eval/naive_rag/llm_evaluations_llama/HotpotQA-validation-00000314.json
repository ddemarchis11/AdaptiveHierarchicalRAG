    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information about the number of days it took to sell 2 million copies of an album in the UK and break a record. It does not address the question directly, nor does it utilize the retrieved context to provide an answer. The Gold Answer specifies '29 days,' which is entirely missing from the Model Answer."
