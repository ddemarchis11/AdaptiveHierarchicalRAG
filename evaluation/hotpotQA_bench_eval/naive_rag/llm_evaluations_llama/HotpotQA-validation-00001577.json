    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct population of Didsbury, Manchester, as per the 2011 census, which is 26,788. Instead, it discusses irrelevant information about Metro Vihar, which is unrelated to the question or the context. The answer is neither correct nor grounded in the retrieved context, and it does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
