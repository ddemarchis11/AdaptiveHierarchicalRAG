    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the profession as 'rapper,' which is supported by the context. However, the Gold Answer specifies additional professions—'professional wrestler' and 'actor'—which are not mentioned in the Model Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not fully cover all key facts from the Gold Answer."
