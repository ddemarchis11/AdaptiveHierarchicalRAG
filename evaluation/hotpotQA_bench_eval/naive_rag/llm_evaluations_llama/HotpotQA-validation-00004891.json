  "question": "Which publisher produced the comic books featuring both Spider-Man and the Daredevils?",
  "gold_answer": "Marvel",
  "llm_answer": "There is insufficient evidence to determine which publisher produced the comic books featuring both Spider-Man and the Daredevils.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Gold Answer clearly states 'Marvel' as the publisher, and the Retrieved Context supports this by mentioning Marvel UK and Marvel Comics in relation to Spider-Man and The Daredevils. The Model Answer incorrectly claims there is insufficient evidence, which contradicts the context and fails to provide the correct answer."
