  "question": "Which mathematician worked with algebraic geometry instead of probability theory, Askold Khovanskii or Andrey Kolmogorov?",
  "gold_answer": "Askold Georgievich Khovanskii",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the mathematician who worked with algebraic geometry instead of probability theory is Askold Khovanskii.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 1.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Askold Khovanskii as the mathematician who worked with algebraic geometry instead of probability theory. This is consistent with the retrieved context, which details Khovanskii's contributions to algebraic geometry and related fields, while Kolmogorov is noted for his work in probability theory. The Model Answer is concise and fully supported by the context."
