    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that Unwritten Law was formed earlier than Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, the formation year of Unwritten Law (1990) is not explicitly supported by the retrieved context, making the faithfulness score lower. Additionally, the Model Answer does not provide specific evidence from the context to confirm the formation year of Unwritten Law, which impacts evidence coverage."
