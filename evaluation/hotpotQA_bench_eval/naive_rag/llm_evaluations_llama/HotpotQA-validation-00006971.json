    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is correct given the retrieved context does not provide any information about the Canadian movie 'Anno 2053' or its cast. While the Gold Answer is correct, the context does not support it, so the model cannot provide the correct answer. The model's response is faithful to the context but does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
