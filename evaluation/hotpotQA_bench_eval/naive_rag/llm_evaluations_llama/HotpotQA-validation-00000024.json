    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies Antoni 'Tolek' Schmeichel as the person voted by the IFFHS in 1992, which is factually wrong. The correct answer is Peter Schmeichel, who was voted 'World's Best Goalkeeper' in 1992. The retrieved context clearly supports this, but the model fails to utilize it correctly."
