    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that Benjamin Britten and Béla Bartók are not from the same country, aligning with the Gold Answer. It provides evidence that Bartók is Hungarian, which is supported by the context. However, the retrieved context does not mention Benjamin Britten, and the Model Answer acknowledges this gap. While the conclusion is correct, the lack of grounding for Britten's nationality reduces faithfulness and evidence coverage."
