    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies 'Al Ansar' as the terrorist group responsible for the battle, whereas the Gold Answer correctly states 'al-Qaeda.' The context clearly supports the Gold Answer, as it mentions that the Taliban was harboring al-Qaeda operatives, and the prisoners were interrogated for al-Qaeda connections. The Model Answer is neither correct nor faithful to the retrieved context, and it fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
