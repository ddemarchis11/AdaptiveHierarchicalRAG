    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect. The Gold Answer provides the title of the autobiography, and the retrieved context identifies Annie Duke as the runner-up of The Celebrity Apprentice 2, which aligns with the Gold Answer. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and does not utilize the context effectively."
