The collection included a selection from all Cohen's books, based on his 1993 books of selected works, Stranger Music , and as well from Book of Longing , with addition of six new song lyrics. Nevertheless, three of those songs, \"A Street\", recited in 2006, \"Feels So Good\", performed live in 2009 and 2010, and \"Born in Chains\", performed live in 2010, were not released on Cohen's 2012 album Old Ideas , with him being unhappy with the versions of the songs in the last moment; the song \"Lullaby\", as presented in the book and performed live in 2009, was completely re-recorded for the album, presenting new lyrics on the same melody.  A biography, I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen , written by Sylvie Simmons , was published in October 2012. The book is the second major biography of Cohen (Ira Nadel's 1997 biography Various Positions was the first). Old Ideas Leonard Cohen's 12th studio album, Old Ideas , was released worldwide on January 31, 2012, and it soon became the highest-charting album of his entire career, reaching No. 1",

Beginning with this record, Cohen began to co-produce his albums. Produced by Cohen and Henry Lewy ( Joni Mitchell 's sound engineer), Recent Songs included performances by Passenger, an Austin-based jazz–fusion band that met Cohen through Mitchell. The band helped Cohen create a new sound by featuring instruments like the oud , the Gypsy violin, and the mandolin . The album was supported by Cohen's major tour with the new band, and Jennifer Warnes and Sharon Robinson on the backing vocals, in Europe in late 1979, and again in Australia, Israel, and Europe in 1980. In 2000, Columbia released an album of live recordings of songs from the 1979 tour, titled Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979 . During the 1970s, Cohen toured twice with Jennifer Warnes as a backup singer (1972 and 1979). Warnes would become a fixture on Cohen's future albums, receiving full co-vocals credit on Cohen's 1984 album Various Positions (although the record was released under Cohen's name, the inside credits say \"Vocals by Leonard Cohen and Jennifer Warnes\").

In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional Recent Songs , which blended his acoustic style with jazz , East Asian, and Mediterranean influences. Cohen's most famous song, \" Hallelujah \", was released on his seventh album, Various Positions (1984). I'm Your Man in 1988 marked Cohen's turn to synthesized productions. In 1992, Cohen released its follow-up, The Future , which had dark lyrics and references to political and social unrest. Cohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of Ten New Songs , a major hit in Canada and Europe. His eleventh album, Dear Heather , followed in 2004. In 2005, Cohen discovered that his manager had stolen most of his money and sold his publishing rights, prompting a return to touring to recoup his losses. Following a successful string of tours between 2008 and 2013, he released three albums in the final years of his life: Old Ideas (2012), Popular Problems (2014), and You Want It Darker (2016), the last of which was released three weeks before his death. His fifteenth studio album, Thanks for the Dance , was released in November 2019.

Cohen supported the record with a series of television interviews and an extensive tour of Europe, Canada, and the US. Many shows were broadcast on European and American television and radio stations, while Cohen performed for the first time in his career on PBS's Austin City Limits show. \"Hallelujah\" \"Hallelujah\" was first released on Cohen's studio album Various Positions in 1984, and he sang it during his Europe tour in 1985. The song had limited initial success but found greater popularity through a 1991 cover by John Cale , which formed the basis for a later cover by Jeff Buckley . \"Hallelujah\" has been performed by almost 200 artists in various languages. New York Times movie reviewer A. O. Scott wrote that \"Hallelujah is one of those rare songs that survives its banalization with at least some of its sublimity intact\". The song is the subject of the 2012 book The Holy or the Broken by Alan Light and the 2022 documentary film Hallelujah: Leonard Cohen, A Journey, A Song by Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine. Janet Maslin 's New York Times book review said that Cohen spent years struggling with the song, which eventually became \"one of the most haunting, mutable and oft-performed songs in American musical history\".",

Various Positions won the 2002 Prix de Montréal at the Montreal World Film Festival . Although the film takes its title from an album by (and Ira Nadel 's biography of) Leonard Cohen , the subject of the film is not Cohen, nor does he have any affiliation with the work. Synopsis In this briskly-paced romantic drama, college student Josh is on track for law school and a place at his father's firm. As his Orthodox Jewish family prepares for their traditional Passover celebrations, Josh hits a brick wall in the form of the alluring and troubled - and not quite Jewish - Cheryth. As things heat up at the dorm and at home, Josh is suddenly questioning his faith, his father and his future. Even worse, Josh is caught in the middle as his father moves to cover up a scandal involving the Jewish cemetery, forcing Josh to take a stand for what he believes is right. Passion and new love collide with family values and the demands of tradition as Josh, Cheryth, and Josh's family find themselves questioning their lives. Love and loyalty look a lot different when examined from various positions. In the end, Josh follows a road of his own choosing and it leads to a future of his own making.
