      "text": "Whakahuihui \"Hui\" Vercoe PCNZM MBE (4 June 1928 – 13 September 2007) was an Anglican bishop in New Zealand. He was the Archbishop of New Zealand from 2004 to 2006, the first person from the Māori church to hold that office. He was also Bishop of Aotearoa from 1981, the first person to be elected to that position by the congregation rather than being appointed by the church hierarchy. He held both offices until his retirement in 2006. He was also the first person to become a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit after the rank was introduced in 2000. Early life Vercoe was born in Tōrere , a coastal Māori village ( kāinga ) near Ōpōtiki in the Eastern Bay of Plenty , in the North Island , to Joseph Vercoe and Wyness Williams. He was named Whakahuihui (\"to gather together\") to record the crowds that gathered to pay their respects to his grandmother, who died on the day he was born. His paternal grandfather, Henry Vercoe, was a Cornish farmer and settler in New Zealand. His father left the family soon after he was born, and he was raised by his mother and maternal grandfather, a Māori farmer, in a small earthen-floored shack ( kauta ). He was educated at",

      "text": "knowledge has been something separate from ethics. In modern times, Foucault argues, anyone can reach \"knowledge\", as long as they are rational beings, educated, willing to participate in the scientific community and use a scientific method. Foucault is critical of this \"modern\" view of knowledge. Foucault describes two types of \"knowledge\": \"savoir\" and \"connaissance\", two French terms that both can be translated as \"knowledge\" but with separate meanings for Foucault. By \"savoir\" Foucault is referring to a process where subjects are created, while at the same time these subjects also become objects for knowledge. An example of this can be seen in criminology and psychiatry. In these sciences, subjects such as \"the rational person\", \"the mentally ill person\", \"the law abiding person\", \"the criminal\", etc. are created, and these sciences center their attention and knowledge on these subjects. The knowledge about these subjects is \"connaissance\", while the process in which subjects and knowledge are created is \"savoir\". A similar term in Foucault's corpus is \"pouvoir/savoir\" (power/knowledge). With this term Foucault is referring to a type of knowledge that is considered \"common sense\", but that is created and withheld in that position (as \"common sense\") by power. The term power/knowledge comes from Jeremy Bentham 's idea that panopticons wouldn't only be",

      "text": "Grand Theft Auto III 's shift to third-person from Grand Theft Auto 's bird's-eye view. GameSpot found that playing in first-person heightened the impact of Grand Theft Auto V 's violence, which made him reflect on morality and character motivation more than before. VideoGamer.com opined that players feel like inhabitants of the world, rather than \"guns attached to a floating camera\". The first-person view, in IGN ' s opinion, aided immersion and created a \"surprisingly different experience\". VideoGamer.com praised the \"finer details\" in first-person animations like camera lean when players take corners on motorcycles, or the navigational instruments in plane cockpits. Reviewers found playing the game more difficult in first-person, but Game Informer preferred the challenge. GameSpot thought the improved graphics and spatial anti-aliasing made the open world \"even more spectacular\". They said that in first-person \"everything looks bigger and more imposing\". IGN favoured the PlayStation 4 version's graphics over the Xbox One but thought both consoles rendered the game well and maintained mostly consistent frame rates. They praised the increased frame rate and graphics options offered in the PC version. VideoGamer.com called the console version's frame rate so consistent it was \"scarcely believable\", although GameSpot cited occasional frame rate dips. They opined that the PC version let players \"witness the full extent of Rockstar's admirable handiwork\", but noted that it \"retains evidence of its",

      "text": "A first-person narrative (also known as a first-person perspective , voice , point of view , etc.) is a mode of storytelling in which a storyteller recounts events from that storyteller's own personal point of view , using first-person grammar such as \"I\", \"me\", \"my\", and \"myself\" (also, in plural form, \"we\", \"us\", etc.). It must be narrated by a first-person character, such as a protagonist (or other focal character ), re-teller, witness, or peripheral character. Alternatively, in a visual storytelling medium (such as video, television, or film), the first-person perspective is a graphical perspective rendered through a character's visual field, so the camera is \"seeing\" out of a character's eyes. Charlotte Brontë , the author of Jane Eyre , which is known as \"the classic example of first-person narrative\" A classic example of a first-person protagonist narrator is Charlotte Brontë 's Jane Eyre (1847), in which the title character is telling the story in which she herself is also the protagonist: \"I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me\". Srikanta by Bengali writer Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay is another first-person perspective novel which is often called a \" masterpiece \". Srikanta , the title character and protagonist of the novel, tells his own story: \"What memories and thoughts crowd into my",

As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a frame story presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell their own story, as in Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein . First-person narrators are often unreliable narrators since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury ), lie (as in The Quiet American by Graham Greene , or The Book of the New Sun series by Gene Wolfe ), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro , or in Ken Kesey 's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ). Henry James discusses his concerns about \"the romantic privilege of the 'first person ' \" in his preface to The Ambassadors , calling it \"the darkest abyss of romance .\" One example of a multi-level narrative structure is Joseph Conrad 's novella Heart of Darkness , which has a double framework: an unidentified \"I\" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses the first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story , it",
