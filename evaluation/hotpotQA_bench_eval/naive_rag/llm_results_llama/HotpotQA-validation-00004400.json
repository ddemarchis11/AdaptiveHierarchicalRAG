Moe Szyslak Mona Simpson Mona Penelope Simpson ( née Olsen , voiced most prominently by Glenn Close , but also Maggie Roswell , Tress MacNeille and Pamela Hayden ) was the estranged wife of Abe Simpson , the mother of Homer Simpson , and the mother-in-law of Marge Simpson . The character is purportedly named after the novelist of the same name , as her ex-husband, Richard Appel , was one of the show's writers. The character appeared briefly in flashbacks in the early seasons of the show and was absent from Homer's life but no reason was given. The season seven episode \" Mother Simpson \" was the first to focus on the character. It was established that Homer believed that his mother was dead, a lie his father, Abe, told him when in reality she was on the run from the law after she sabotaged Mr. Burns's biological warfare laboratory, living under the name \"Anita Bonghit\".

He is the son of Mona and Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson . Over the first 400 episodes of The Simpsons , Homer held over 188 different jobs. His primary role is as a nuclear safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7-G. This position, which he is unqualified for, often sees him neglecting his duties or falling asleep on the job. His boss, Mr. Burns , frequently ignores or forgets his existence. Creator Matt Groening chose the nuclear plant as Homer's workplace to provide opportunities for comedic chaos. Although Homer's numerous other jobs each last only one episode, earlier seasons often explained how he was fired from the plant and rehired. In later episodes, these transitions became more impulsive, with his side ventures occurring without reference to his regular employment. The Simpsons employs a floating timeline , where characters either do not age or age minimally. Therefore, the show is always assumed to be set in the current year . Despite the show's flexible timeline, several episodes link events in Homer's life to specific time periods. In \" Mother Simpson \" ( season seven , 1995), Homer's mother, Mona, is portrayed as a radical who went into hiding in 1969 after a run-in with the law. \" The Way We Was \"",

The Simpsons Castellaneta is most famous for his roles on the longest-running American animated television show, The Simpsons , most notably as Homer Simpson . The Tracey Ullman Show included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family . Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers asked Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge Simpson respectively, rather than hire more actors. Homer's voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau , but Castellaneta could not \"get enough power behind that voice\" and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour recording sessions. He tried to find something easier, so he \"dropped the voice down\", and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest, and is said to \"let his IQ go.\" Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it. Despite Homer's fame, Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, \"except, maybe, by a die-hard fan.\" Castellaneta with fellow Simpsons voice actors Nancy Cartwright , Yeardley Smith and Julie Kavner in 2009",

Krusty's voice is based on Chicago television's Bob Bell , who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV 's Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984. During early recording sessions, he recorded a new version of Barney's loud trademark belch for every episode but discovered that it was not easy for him to belch each time a script called for it. Castellaneta chose a recording of what he believed was his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard. Groundskeeper Willie's first appearance was in the season two episode \" Principal Charming \". The character was written as an angry janitor, and Castellaneta was assigned to perform the voice. He did not know what voice to use and Sam Simon , who was directing at the time, suggested he use an accent. Castellaneta first tried using Hispanic voicing, which Simon felt was too clichéd . He then tried a \"big dumb Swede \", which was also rejected.",
