It took place on November 3, 2007 at the site of the now-closed George Air Force Base (currently used as Southern California Logistics Airport ), in Victorville, California ( Google map ), in the West of the United States. Discovery's Science channel followed a few of the teams and covered the Urban Challenge in its Robocars Archived 2008-07-30 at the Wayback Machine series. Overview The $2 million winner was Tartan Racing, a collaborative effort by Carnegie Mellon University and General Motors Corporation, with their vehicle \"Boss\", a heavily modified Chevrolet Tahoe . The second-place finisher earning the $1 million prize was the Stanford Racing Team with their entry \"Junior\", a 2006 Volkswagen Passat . Coming in third place was team Victor Tango from Virginia Tech winning the $500,000 prize with their 2005 Ford Escape hybrid, \"Odin\". The course involved a 96 kilometres (60 mi) urban area course, to be completed in less than 6 hours . Rules included obeying all traffic regulations while negotiating with other traffic and obstacles and merging into traffic. While the 2004 and 2005 events were more physically challenging for the vehicles , the robots operated in isolation and did not encounter other vehicles on the course, the Urban Challenge required designers to build vehicles",
