Rohlsen Airport ( IATA : STX , ICAO : TISX , FAA LID : STX ) is a public airport six miles (10 km) southwest of Christiansted on the island of St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands . The airport is named after Henry E. Rohlsen, a St. Croix native who was one of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II . The airport, which was a hub for Aero Virgin Islands in the 1970s and 1980s, can receive jets up to the size of the Boeing 747s .

During the time the military operated the airport, it was called Benedict Airfield. When the airport was transferred to civilian control, it was renamed to honor former St. Croix resident Alexander Hamilton. Several airlines have operated scheduled passenger jet service to St. Croix in the past, including Air Florida with Douglas DC-9-10s , Caribair with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s , Continental Airlines with Boeing",

      "text": "Southwest Florida International Airport ( IATA : RSW , ICAO : KRSW , FAA LID : RSW ) is a major county-owned airport in the South Fort Myers area of unincorporated Lee County , Florida , United States . The airport serves the Southwest Florida region, including the Cape Coral-Fort Myers , Naples-Marco Island , and Punta Gorda metropolitan areas, and is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection port of entry. It currently is the second-busiest single-runway airport in the United States, after San Diego International Airport , California . In 2025, the airport served 11,154,458 passengers, the most in its history. The airport sits on 13,555 acres (5,486 ha, 21.2 sq.mi.) of land just southeast of Fort Myers, about 6,000 acres of which have been conserved as swamp lands and set aside for environmental mitigation . History Planning and construction Prior to the opening of the airport, the Southwest Florida region was served by Page Field in Fort Myers. By the 1970s, however, Page Field clearly had become too small to handle increasing future demand for commercial flights into the region. Expanding Page Field was determined to be impractical because its airfield was constrained by U.S. 41 to the west and expanding the airfield to the east would require bridging the Ten Mile Canal and relocating a railroad track.

Owned and operated by the City of Tallahassee, it serves as the primary airport for Florida's capital city and the surrounding Big Bend region. Despite its designation as an \" international airport \", TLH currently does not offer scheduled international passenger flights. The international status was granted in 2015 following the installation of a federal customs and border protection facility, enabling it to handle international cargo and charter flights. As of 2024, the airport provides commercial passenger service through several major airlines, including American Airlines , Delta Air Lines , and Silver Airways , offering nonstop flights to key hubs such as Atlanta , Charlotte , Dallas/Fort Worth , and Miami . With annual passenger traffic averaging between 850,000 and 900,000, Tallahassee International Airport ranks as one of the smaller commercial airports in Florida, yet remains a crucial transportation hub for the northern part of the state.
