Cast Lee Bowman as Jeff Thompson Rocky Graziano as Rocky Episodes Production United Artists' (UA) Aubrey Schenck-Howard W. Koch Productions filmed 38 episodes of Miami Undercover in Florida in the fall of 1959.

By then UA had acquired Ziv Productions, whose sales people helped to gain 141 markets for the show. An additional factor was that the UA-Ziv combination had no other new programs to meet its commitments for January 1961. References External links Miami Undercover at IMDb v t e",
