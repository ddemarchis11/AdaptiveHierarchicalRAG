      "text": "Professor D S Mills Daniel Simon Mills , FRCVS (born 21 August 1966) is an English veterinarian and biologist and the UK's first Professor of Veterinary Behavioural Medicine based at the University of Lincoln , United Kingdom. He attended St Edmund's College, Ware before studying at the University of Bristol where he received his BVSc degree and completed his PhD degree in animal behaviour from De Montfort University . Biography After some time spent in general practice, he became a Lecturer, Senior Lecturer and Principal Lecturer in animal behaviour at De Montfort University, and subsequently the University of Lincoln , where he has been Head of the Department of Biological Sciences, and now heads up the clinical animal behaviour team. He has an active teaching and research portfolio. His research has focused on the assessment of emotion in companion animals and the use of semiochemicals to manage their problem behaviour (pheromonatherapy ). He has led the development of what has become known as the psychobiological approach to animal behaviour assessment, and has published more than 200 full scientific papers, books and chapters. Among his achievements are becoming the first person within the UK to be recognised as a specialist in veterinary behavioural medicine by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons . and being awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in 2016 in recognition of his contribution to the field. In 2020 he was also listed in the top 2% of scientists in the world and in 2021 was in",

He has been a professor and department head in the Department of Biological Sciences at Southeastern Louisiana University since 2004, and held the Kenneth Dyson Endowed Professorship in Biological Sciences from 2012 to 2015. He is well known for over 30 years of research on the secondary sexual characteristics of salamanders and more generally on comparative histoanatomy of the urogenital systems of vertebrates. and was recognized as the 2013 Distinguished Herpetologist of the Year by the Herpetologists' League . Early life A native of Canton, Ohio , Sever was interested in dinosaurs at an early age, but, \"You couldn't find dinosaurs, but you could find lizards and turtles, things that looked like dinosaurs.\" His early exposure to herpetology came from the Boy Scouts , and he is an Eagle Scout . Academic career Sever earned his Ph.D. from Tulane University in 1974 where he studied the secondary sexual characters of plethodontid salamanders under Harold A. Dundee. He worked at his first academic post at Saint Mary's College (Indiana) from 1974 to 2004, serving as chair from 1980 to 1989.

Trauth , in his capacity as president of the Herpetologist's League, stated that Sever's research contributions were why he was chosen. \"Early in his studies, Dave's histological research focused primarily on salamander cloacal anatomy and, specifically, the spermatheca or sperm storage structure in these animals,\" said Trauth. \"His numerous papers on these structures have dominated the international literature on this subject for decades,\" and \"I consider Dave to be today's world leading authority on vertebrate reproductive histology\". \"He is without question the foremost histo-herpetologist that has ever lived.\" Sever discovered and described the plethodontid Junaluska salamander ( Eurycea junaluska ), which lives in the southern Appalachian Mountains .

The society's founding charter states the objective of promoting the cause of biological sciences in Pakistan, by publishing an academic journal (to be called Pakistan Journal of Biology ), holding meetings, seminars and conferences to discuss biological problems, and creating facilities for original research in biological sciences. The society was registered on 10 April 1955 under the Societies Act XXI of 1860 of the Punjab, with an initial membership of 142 scientists from across Pakistan. Mian Afzal Hussain was elected as the first president, with Nazir Ahmad as secretary and Sher Ahmad Lodhi as its treasurer.",
