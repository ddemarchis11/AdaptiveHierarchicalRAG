Inspired by Whoopie Goldberg 's Academy Award-winning performance in Ghost (1990), Ephron felt hiring a comedian in a funny supporting role would similarly benefit Sleepless in Seattle . O'Donnell based her performance on singer and actress Bette Midler , specifically emulating the way she walks and talks in order to convey \"the funny, caustic best friend with a heart of gold\" role she had wanted to play since deciding to become an actor. Eventually reduced from two-pages, the speech was the longest of O'Donnell's career at that point. She noted her experience was particularly different from A League of Their Own , which had been largely improvisational compared to Ephron's organized directorial style. O'Donnell and Ephron lived in the same apartment building while filming Sleepless in Seattle , which Ephron had obtained for her. Hanks' wife Rita Wilson originally auditioned for the role of Becky, but Ephron preferred her for the role of Sam's sister Suzy, which the director found particularly convenient because Wilson was already in Seattle with her husband. Ephron cast Rob Reiner , who directed When Harry Met Sally ..., as Sam's friend in the film, with Reiner contributing to many of the film's laughs. According to some of the main cast, Ephron typically insisted that the actors recite their lines almost exactly as-written, although Ephron herself said she",

Olga Massov of The Washington Post said some tiramisu began to suffer in quality due to their popularity, reporting that several restaurants began taking shortcuts in order to keep up with the demand. In a 2014 interview with RogerEbert.com , Reiner dismissed tiramisu as overrated, insisting that he would never order it for himself.

Despite being her second directorial effort, Sleepless in Seattle 's success eclipsed that of her directorial debut, and ultimately established Ephron \"as a major directorial force in the rom-com genre\". In 2018, The A.V. Club 's Caroline Siede said the film remains her finest work as a director. On its 20-year anniversary, HuffPost wrote that the film continues to resonate due to \"Ephron's sharp dialogue and the inherent goodness and charm projected by both Hanks and Ryan\". According to Ariel Levy of The New Yorker , Sleepless in Seattle established Ephron as a famous director. In 2013, co-executive producer Lynda Obst released a book named after the film, Sleepless in Hollywood: Tales from the New Abnormal in the Movie Business , which explores the decline of romantic comedies during the 2010s. Obst remarked that Sleepless in Seattle 's nearly $300 million gross is hardly considered a \"smash\" as of 2014, explaining, \"Studios aren't happy unless it makes close to a billion dollars\". Sleepless in Seattle is credited with introducing most Americans to tiramisu , which had been a relatively obscure dessert before 1993. Rob Reiner's character Jay mentions \"tiramisu\" during a conversation with Sam about dating, which Sam mistakes a euphemism for a sexual act. Jay does",
