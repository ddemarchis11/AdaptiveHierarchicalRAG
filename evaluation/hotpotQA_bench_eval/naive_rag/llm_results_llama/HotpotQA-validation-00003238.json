After being out of print for years, Hollywood Records released the album for digital download on April 2, 2013. The title of the album is not a reference to \"Tricky\" Dick Nixon (former POTUS Richard M. Nixon ), but rather a person by the name of Richard J. \"Dick\" Latch, who preferred to be addressed as \"Not Richard, but Dick.\" Production The album was produced by Jon Lupfer and the band. Critical reception Trouser Press wrote that \"the simplified Not Richard, but Dick favors down-the-hatch indie-rock, which suits the Milkmen fine but doesn’t make for as entertaining an experience.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that \"the band expresses the discontent of today's teens and twentysomethings with a vividness rarely summoned by even conscientiously 'righteous' rockers.\" The Tampa Bay Times thought that \"the Milkmen have always had problems making their punkish songs live up to the great titles ... on Not Richard, But Dick they again weigh in with some classic bits of satire and fall short on a few other occasions.\" The Scripps Howard News Service deemed the album \"a goofy palate of cultural references sure to prompt laughter and groans.\" Track listing \"Leggo My Ego\" - 2:21 \"I Dream",

A furious Geils filed a lawsuit against the other group members over using the band's name for a tour without him. He named band members Richard Salwitz, Danny Klein, Peter Wolf and Seth Justman in the lawsuit filed in Boston Superior Court, claiming that they \"planned and conspired\" to continue touring without him and were unlawfully using the group's trademarked name. Geils' lawsuit was unsuccessful. Angry at his bandmates for what they did, he permanently left the band, although he admitted in an interview several years later he did not bear his bandmates any ill will, saying, \"I wish them well. There is no bitterness on my part...\" Geils died in 2017. The J. Geils band performing in 2013 Despite losing their eponymous leader, the J. Geils Band remained active.

The first one was a cover version of The Valentinos ' \" Lookin' for a Love \", which appeared on their second album The Morning After and was their Top 40 debut in 1972 (at No. 39 on the Billboard chart). The album was released in October 1971.  In April 1972, Atlantic staff producer Michael Cuscuna enlisted the J. Geils Band to record two tracks behind Buddy Guy , \"This Old Fool\" and \"Honeydripper\"; these songs were included on the album Buddy Guy & Junior Wells Play the Blues, issued in August 1972.

Initial influences included James Cotton and Little Walter – in a 2008 interview, harmonica star Magic Dick said they were all \"harp freaks\". They became The J. Geils Blues Band, later dropping the word \"Blues\" from the band name. Fan Seth Justman joined on keyboards and the band started to earn a sizable following in the Boston area. The band took its time carefully considering various offers of contracts. Unofficial live recordings circulated: as noted in Creem , \"WBCN had the infamous J. Geils 'bathroom tapes' (that were almost exactly what the name implies) and a tape of their performance at Alternate Media Conference at Goddard College, but these hardly sufficed\" to fans who wanted a proper album.
