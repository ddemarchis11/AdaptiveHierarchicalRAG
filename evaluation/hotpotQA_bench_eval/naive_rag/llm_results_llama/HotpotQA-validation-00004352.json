Set within the real-life Walt Disney World , the game centers on racing around tracks that are inspired and based on attractions at the resort's theme parks to acquire missing parts for the park's fireworks machine, which was accidentally destroyed by Chip 'n' Dale while they were gathering acorns.

Completing the story will also unlock a track inspired by Splash Mountain . However, on tracks inspired by Test Track , Typhoon Lagoon , and Hollywood Studios , players must collect thirty coins around the driving areas of these tracks within four minutes in order to complete their events. The game features 13 playable racers. With the exception of Chip, Dale (both of whom appear in their Rescue Rangers outfits) and Jiminy Cricket , the game's cast are original characters created especially for the game.

The dark ride , which opened on January 15, 1975, is the original version of the iconic attraction that has since been replicated at other Disney theme park locations worldwide, with the exception of Shanghai Disneyland Resort. Space Mountain is one of the first computer operated roller coasters and is also the oldest operating roller coaster in the state of Florida . Walt Disney originally conceived the idea of a space-themed roller coaster for Disneyland following the success of Matterhorn Bobsleds in 1959. However, due to technological and spatial limitations, the concept was further developed and eventually became a part of Walt Disney World. RCA helped fund construction and sponsored the ride from 1975 to 1993. FedEx assumed sponsorship from 1994 to 2004. Space Mountain has undergone a number of changes since its opening, including new ride trains in 1989 and 2009, as well as incremental upgrades to incorporate modern roller coaster technology. It has also seen a number of cosmetic renovations to its entry, queue, and post-show elements, many of which were necessitated by changes in its corporate sponsorship over the years. Original concept and design WED Enterprises engineers examining a Space Mountain model in 1973 The Space Mountain concept was a descendant of the first Disney \"mountain\" attraction, the Matterhorn",

Manufactured by Vekoma , the roller coaster opened to the public on July 29, 1999. It uses linear motor electromagnetic technology for acceleration, which propels riders from 0 to 57 mph (92 km/h) in 2.8 seconds. Riders experience up to 5 Gs and travel through three inversions, which include a sea serpent and a corkscrew . The attraction also features recorded music and appearances from American rock band Aerosmith . A second installation with an identical track layout opened within Disneyland Paris as Rock 'n' Roller Coaster avec Aerosmith in time for the opening of Walt Disney Studios Park on March 16, 2002. The attraction was later re-themed to Avengers Assemble: Flight Force as part of the new Avengers Campus at the park. The original attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios will close on March 2, 2026. The coaster will be rethemed to The Muppets and reopen later in the year. History In April 1998, Disney-MGM Studios (later named Disney's Hollywood Studios) announced that they would be adding Rock 'n' Roller Coaster. The ride was set to open in 1999 for the park's tenth anniversary. The park hired Vekoma to build the launched indoor roller coaster , and construction began two months prior to the",

      "text": "Reception Reception The Dreamcast version received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic . Reviewers of IGN and Eurogamer praised the presentation of the PlayStation ( IGN ) and Dreamcast versions ( Eurogamer ), and how the developers were able to recreate popular attractions in-game, and the \"Disney-esque\" charm it has. Both also berated the difficulty (with the CPU racers being so hard to beat), some of the graphics, and the fact that the developers only used a small sound sample from each attraction and looped it, which got annoying quickly. A reviewer of GameSpot called the Dreamcast version a good entry to the kart racing genre, while also bringing attention to its many similarities to Mario Kart . The amount of detail put into the tracks and the sound were also praised, but the reviewer was disappointed by the game's short play length. Greg Orlando of NextGen said of the same console version: \"Video game behemoth Eidos has fallen prey to the notion that wacky characters plus karts plus odd power-ups automatically equals good racing fun. It doesn't\". Nintendo Power gave the Game Boy Color version a mixed review, nearly three months before its U.S. release date.

      "text": "engineers examining a Space Mountain model in 1973 The Space Mountain concept was a descendant of the first Disney \"mountain\" attraction, the Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland , which opened in 1959. The Matterhorn's success had convinced Walt Disney that thrilling rides did have a place in his park. In 1964, Walt first approached designer John Hench with his idea for a new attraction that would be the focal point of a renovated Tomorrowland planned for 1967. His \"Space Port\" would include a roller-coaster-style ride in the dark, with lighting and other special effects. Originally called \"Space Voyage\" with concept artwork by John Hench , Clem Hall, George McGinnis, and Herb Ryman . The attraction concept continued to be refined over the coming years by WED Enterprises , and in June 1966, the \"Space Port\" attraction was called \"Space Mountain\" for the first time. WED partnered with Arrow Development Company , the same company that had helped design the Matterhorn's roller coaster systems years before. The initial concept was to have four separate tracks, but the technology available at the time, combined with the amount of space required versus that which was available within Disneyland, made such a design impossible. It is commonly believed that WED had put aside the design of Space Mountain indefinitely after Walt Disney's death and revived the project after the Magic Kingdom's early success. However press releases, concept models, and preview brochures",
