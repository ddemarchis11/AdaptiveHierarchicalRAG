The 165,000-acre (670 km 2 ) plot of land was purchased by Jeff Bezos in 2004. The company uses the spaceport for testing and launch services for its New Shepard rocket. The launch site has a sub-orbital launch pad and also has a number of rocket engine test stands . The engine test cells are at the site to support the hydrolox , methalox and storable propellant engines that are used. There are three test cells for testing the methalox BE-4 engine, two of which support full-thrust and full-duration burns, and one that supports short-duration, high-pressure preburner tests. The spaceport also includes a vehicle processing facility and an astronaut training facility. The company's first human spaceflight launched from Launch Site One (LS1) on July 20, 2021. The flight, dubbed NS-16 , carried its founder Jeff Bezos , his brother Mark Bezos , test pilot and Mercury 13 member Wally Funk , and Dutchman Oliver Daemen on a suborbital flight aboard New Shepard 4.

The Dream Chaser successfully completed the free-flight and passed the drop test on November 11 over the Mojave Desert . The uncrewed vehicle made a landing at Edwards Air Force Base . Crewed capsule testing Drop tests of prototype crewed space capsules may be done to test the survivability of landing, primarily by testing the capsule's descent characteristics and its post- reentry landing systems. These tests are typically carried out uncrewed prior to any human spaceflight testing. Apollo command module In 1963, North American Aviation built BP-19A, an uncrewed boilerplate Apollo command module for use in drop testing. NASA conducted a series of tests in 1964 which involved dropping BP-19A from a C-133 Cargomaster in order to test the capsule's parachute systems prior to the start of crewed testing of the Apollo spacecraft. Orion capsule Orion test article after release from C-130 and separation from pallet In 2011 and 2012, NASA conducted a series of short drop tests on the survivability of water landings in its Orion crewed capsule by repeatedly dropping an Orion test vehicle into a large water basin. The tests simulated water landings at speeds varying from 7 to 50 mph (11 to 80 km/h) by changing the height of the drop gantry above the basin. The range of landing",

Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damage, while the additional accounting for the \"low-probability, high-damage events\" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the \"moderate\" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures. Sea level rise is being exacerbated by subsidence , which is occurring at up to 87 millimetres (3.4 in) per year.

Most commercial and financial businesses are carried out in the central business district situated on the island. This is also where most of the country's commercial banks, financial institutions, and major corporations are headquartered.

As of 2016, Charon is on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington. Goddard The next test vehicle, named Goddard (also known as PM1), first flew on November 13, 2006. The flight was successful. A test flight for December 2 never launched. According to Federal Aviation Administration records, two further flights were performed by Goddard. Blue Engine 1, or BE-1, was the first rocket engine developed by the company and was used in the company's Goddard development vehicle. PM2 Another early suborbital test vehicle, PM2, had two flight tests in 2011 in west Texas. The vehicle designation may be short for \"Propulsion Module\". The first flight was a short hop (low altitude, VTVL takeoff and landing mission) flown on May 6, 2011. The second flight, August 24, 2011, failed when ground personnel lost contact and control of the vehicle. The company released its analysis of the failure nine days later.
