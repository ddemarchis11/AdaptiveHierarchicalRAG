      "text": "Basie Meets Bond is a 1966 album by Count Basie and his orchestra . The album is a collection of musical pieces originating from the first four James Bond films; Dr No , From Russia with Love , Goldfinger and Thunderball . The album was Basie's first for United Records , and was produced by Teddy Reig . Reception Ken Dryden, writing on AllMusic said of the album that \"While it seems doubtful that Basie added any of this music to his regular band repertoire, his band does its best to do justice to the arrangements.\" Dryden praised Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis's solo on \"Goldfinger\" and Marshall Royal and Count Basie's solos on \"Thunderball\". Dryden conceded that the album could be \"safely bypassed by most jazz fans\" but said that Basie's fans might \"find this surprising LP worth the investment\".
