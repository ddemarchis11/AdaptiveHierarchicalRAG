Aimed for a more sophisticated audience than typical light superhero adventures, The Daredevils featured Captain Britain stories by Alan Moore and Alan Davis paired with reprints of Frank Miller 's Daredevil stories. It has been speculated this was in response to Dez Skinn 's new anthology Warrior . Publishing history Editor Bernie Jaye gave writer Alan Moore and artist Alan Davis , rising stars in the comics industry at the time, considerable freedom in terms of the material they produced. Aside from the occasional pull-out posters, all contents were printed in black-and-white, not colour. The magazine had a circulation of around 25,000 copies, and lasted eleven issues before merging with The Mighty World of Marvel . Content Comic strips Captain Britain Always the first story in any issue, Captain Britain continued the \" Jaspers' Warp \" storyline from Marvel Super-Heroes , which Alan Moore had recently taken over writing with Alan Davis as artist. The strip would be continued in The Mighty World of Marvel after The Daredevils was cancelled. Daredevil Issues from Frank Miller 's Daredevil run were reprinted in black and white, giving the series its title. The stories were originally printed in Daredevil (Vol. 1) #159-170.

      "text": "Avenging Spider-Man is the title of an American comic book series that was published monthly by Marvel Comics from 2012 to 2013, featuring the adventures of the fictional superhero Spider-Man . The events in the story take place in the primary continuity of the mainstream Marvel Universe along with the events of The Amazing Spider-Man and later The Superior Spider-Man . This was the first ongoing series to feature Spider-Man as the main character besides The Amazing Spider-Man since the cancellation of Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man and the second volume of Sensational Spider-Man in December 2008 following the conclusion of the \" One More Day \" storyline. Avenging Spider-Man has also been instrumental in Marvel's shift towards including codes to receive free digital copies of the comic with purchased print comic books. Format The format of the series was very similar to the Marvel Team-Up comic book where Spider-Man teams up with another character in every issue. The first and second volumes of Marvel Team-Up primarily (but not exclusively) featured Spider-Man whereas Avenging Spider-Man exclusively features Spider-Man. Publication history Marvel announced the publication in June 2011 . The first issue was released 9 November 2011, with Zeb Wells as the writer, Joe Madureira as the penciller, and Ferran Daniel as the colorist. The first issue outsold both issues of The Amazing Spider-Man released in November and was the sixth best selling comic book of the month. The first three issues of the series contained a code for",

He sews a spider-web patterned spandex costume that fully covers his body and builds wrist-mounted \" web-shooter \" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses for both fighting and \"web swinging\" across the city. Peter initially used his powers for personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a burglar that he could have stopped but did not, he learned that \" with great power comes great responsibility \", and began to use his powers to fight crime as Spider-Man. Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series , the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man . Since his introduction, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a high school student to attending college to currently being somewhere in his late 20s. Peter has been a member of numerous superhero teams, most notably the Avengers and Fantastic Four . Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014 following the \" Dying Wish \" storyline, where Peter appears to die after Doctor Octopus orchestrates a body swap with him and becomes the Superior Spider-Man . Marvel has also published comic books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man , including Spider-Man 2099 , which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara , the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man , which features the adventures of a teenage Peter Parker in the alternate",
