Balasubramaniam school, and they received their training in classical vocal music from the noted vocalist and teacher himself. Career Jayalakshmi has rendered songs in her trained, cultured and 'ringing' sweet voice in Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada movies from the late 1940s to the early 60s. She also has a few playback singing credits from the 1970s. In Deivam, Kunnakkudi Vaidyanathan had both Radha and Jayalakshmi render Thiruchendooril Por Purindhu , a devotional song set in Thiruthani. This is perhaps the only film song sung by Radha of the duo. But both have given stage performances throughout India. The singers had no longer been giving performances towards the time of Jayalakshmi's death, but instead had shifted their efforts to teaching Carnatic music and were regarded as great teachers. Shanmukhapriya and Haripriya, popularly known as the Priya Sisters , were their students. Music composers Jayalakshmi sang for Jayalakshmi's most memorable songs date from the 50s films. S.
