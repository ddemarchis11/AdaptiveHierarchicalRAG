Equipment was never modernized, and the railroad used antique stub switches and link-and-pin couplers to the end of operations in 1943. The line was the last commercial carrier in the United States to use such couplers or to run above ground on a 2 ft ( 610 mm ) gauge. (The 2 ft ( 610 mm ) gauge Chicago Tunnel Company continued underground operation as a common carrier freight subway until 1959.)

The Monson and Athens Railroad Company was chartered",
