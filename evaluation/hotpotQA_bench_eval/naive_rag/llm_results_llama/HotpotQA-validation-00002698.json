      "text": "A Guarani speaker Paraguayan Guarani , or simply Guarani ( avañe'ẽ ), is a language of South America that belongs to the Tupi–Guarani branch of the Tupian language family . It is one of the two official languages of Paraguay (along with Spanish ), where it is spoken by the majority of the population, and where half of the rural population are monolingual speakers of the language. Variants of the language are spoken by communities in neighboring countries including parts of northeastern Argentina , southeastern Bolivia and southwestern Brazil . It is a second official language of the Argentine province of Corrientes since 2004 and the Brazilian city of Tacuru since 2010. Guarani is also one of the three official languages of Mercosur , alongside Spanish and Portuguese . Guarani is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages and remains commonly used among the Paraguayan people and neighboring communities. This is unique among American languages; language shift towards European colonial languages (in this case, the other official language of Spanish ) has otherwise been a nearly universal phenomenon in the Western Hemisphere , but Paraguayans have maintained their traditional language while also adopting Spanish. The name \"Guarani\" is generally used for the official language of Paraguay. However, this is part of a dialect chain , most of whose components are also often called Guarani.  History While Guarani, in its Classical form , was the only language spoken in the expansive missionary",

      "text": "The Cabécar language is an indigenous American language of the Chibchan language family spoken by the Cabécar people in the inland Turrialba Region , Cartago Province , Costa Rica . As of 2007, 2,000 speakers were monolingual. It is the only indigenous language in Costa Rica with monolingual adults. The language is also known by its dialect names Chirripó, Estrella, Telire, and Ujarrás. History Cabécar is considered to be one of a few \"Chibcha-speaking tribes\", categorized by similarities in the languages that they speak. Other Chibcha speaking tribes include the Bribri and the Boruca , also of Costa Rica. It is believed that the languages of the Chibcha speaking tribes shared a common ancestor around 8,000 years ago. However, differences in the languages are thought to have come about from the influence of outside people, including influences from Mesoamerica . Geographic distribution Cabécar is an endangered language spoken in Costa Rica. It is spoken by the Cabécar people , an indigenous group located near the Talamancan mountains of Costa Rica. Dialects and varieties There are two different dialects of Cabécar, each of which has more narrow dialects within it. One of these is spoken in the north, while the other is spoken in southern parts of Costa Rica. Phonology Cabécar uses a Latin alphabet with umlauts",

      "text": "of whose components are also often called Guarani.  History While Guarani, in its Classical form , was the only language spoken in the expansive missionary territories, Paraguayan Guarani has its roots outside of the Jesuit Reductions .  Modern scholarship has shown that Guarani was always the primary language of colonial Paraguay, both inside and outside the reductions. Following the expulsion of the Jesuits in the 18th century, the residents of the reductions gradually migrated north and west towards Asunción , a demographic shift that brought about a decidedly one-sided shift away from the Jesuit dialect that the missionaries had curated in the southern and eastern territories of the colony. By and large, the Guarani of the Jesuits shied away from direct phonological loans from Spanish. Instead, the missionaries relied on the agglutinative nature of the language to formulate new precise translations or calque terms from Guarani morphemes. This process often led the Jesuits to employ complicated, highly synthetic terms to convey European concepts. By contrast, the Guarani spoken outside of the missions was characterized by a free, unregulated flow of Hispanicisms; frequently, Spanish words and phrases were simply incorporated into Guarani with minimal phonological adaptation.  A good example of that phenomenon is found in the word \"communion\". The Jesuits, using their agglutinative strategy, rendered this word \" Tupârahava \", a calque based on the word \" Tupâ \", meaning God.",
