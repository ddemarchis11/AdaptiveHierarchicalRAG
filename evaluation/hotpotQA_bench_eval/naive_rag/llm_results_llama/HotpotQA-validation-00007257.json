The original festival is the White Nights Festival held in Saint Petersburg , Russia . The white nights is the name given in areas of high latitude to the weeks around the summer solstice in June during which sunsets are late, sunrises are early and darkness is never complete. In Saint Petersburg, the Sun does not set until after 10 p.m., and the twilight lasts almost all night. The White Nights Festival in Saint Petersburg is famous for fireworks and Scarlet Sails , a show celebrating the end of school year. Other festivals following this lead have arisen using names such as White Night, Light Nights or Nuit Blanche which may be held in the winter as opposed to the summer. Nomenclature Some cities use the French phrase Nuit blanche (or Nuits blanches , if the event is spread over more than one night). Some use the same words in their language: White Nights, Noite Branca ( Portuguese ), La Notte Bianca ( Italian ), La Noche en Blanco ( Spanish ), Noaptea alba ( Romanian ), Nata e Bardhe ( Albanian ), Baltā Nakts in Latvian . Others invent their own names, such as Lejl Imdawwal (\"Lit Night\") in",

E.g. in 2019: Helsinki, Turku and Oulu 15 August; Tampere and Vaasa 8 August. It is one of many White Night festivals held worldwide. The Night of the arts is an art festival , where art-related events happen in various places all around the city. The events typically begin at around 6 to 8 PM and last at least until midnight, sometimes even to early morning. Events are held in museums , bookstores , public parks and other places. A performing artist spreads confetti in the audience during the main event of Night of the Arts in 2025. The event has received criticism because of increased use of alcoholic beverages in public late at night. Because of this, a derogatory nickname for the event is the \"Night of the bottles\" ( Pullojen yö ). Katutaiteiden yö In recent years there has been a sort of a counter-event called Katutaiteiden yö (\"Street arts night\") that concentrated around graffiti in its different forms. To date, the events have only taken place in Helsinki , whilst in other cities, graffiti happenings are a regular part of the official event.

Iceland The summer solstice in Iceland is celebrated on the 24th of June, on the day of St. John the Baptist , when only three hours of modest darkness are experienced in the region of Reykjavík . It is called Jónsmessa , and it is celebrated in small groups of family or friends around bonfires. It is however not as popular as it was before, and most people don't take any part of it, although some people hold on to it.

Worldwide Europe Britain The British festivals are called Light night and began in Leeds , England in 2005 as part of the launch of the region-wide Illuminate Cultural Festival. In Leeds in October 2005, these 'unusual cultural events' included a string quartet playing at the top of the Town Hall clock tower, a tour round a pitch black church with only a torch and a sinister audio-guide that could not be trusted, and a 'Treasure Hunt' from the Institute for Crazy Dancing. The Treasure Hunt involved 200 audience members being led across the city and becoming a show in their own right, collecting white boiler suits and umbrellas en route, and dancing up and down Briggate , the main shopping street, with three shire horses, an ice cream van and the bagpipes of Leeds Pipe Band.

Sgt. Pepper topped the UK charts for 23 consecutive weeks, with a further four weeks at number one in the period through to February 1968. With 2.5 million copies sold within three months of its release, Sgt. Pepper ' s initial commercial success exceeded that of all previous Beatles albums. It was the first rock album to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year . It sustained its immense popularity into the 21st century while breaking numerous sales records. Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine Two Beatles film projects were conceived within weeks of completing Sgt. Pepper : Magical Mystery Tour , a one-hour television film, and Yellow Submarine , an animated feature-length film produced by United Artists . The group began recording music for the former in late April 1967, but the project then lay dormant as they focused on recording songs for the latter. On 25 June, the Beatles performed their forthcoming single \" All You Need Is Love \" to an estimated 350 million viewers on Our World , the first live global television link.
