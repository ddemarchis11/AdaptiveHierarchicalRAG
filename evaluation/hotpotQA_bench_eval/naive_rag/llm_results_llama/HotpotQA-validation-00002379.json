      "text": "learned that Cammarano had completed Manrico's third-act aria, \"Di quella pira\" just eight days before his death, but now he turned to De Sanctis to find him another librettist. Leone Emanuele Bardare was a young poet from Naples who was beginning his career; eventually he wrote more than 15 librettos before 1880. Composer and librettist met in Rome around 20 December 1852 and Verdi began work on both Trovatore and La traviata . His main aim, having changed his mind about the distribution of characters in the opera, was to enhance the role of Leonora, thus making it \"a two-women opera\" and he communicated many of these ideas ahead of time via letters to De Sanctis over several months. Leonora now was to have a cantabile for the Miserere as well as retaining \"Tacea la Notte\" in act 1 with its cabaletta. Changes were also made to Azucena's \"Stride la vampa\" and to the Count's lines. Taking into account the last-minute requirements of the censor and the consequent changes, overall, the revisions and changes enhanced the opera, and the result was that it was a critical and a popular success.

Regarding Leonora, Budden describes her music as \"mov[ing] in long phrases most characterized by a soaring 'aspiring' quality\" whereas \"Azucena's melodies evolve in short, often commonplace phrases based on the repetition of short rhythmic patterns\". Cultural references Enrico Caruso once said that all it takes for a successful performance of Il trovatore is the four greatest singers in the world. On many occasions, this opera and its music have been featured in various forms of popular culture and entertainment. Scenes of comic chaos play out over a performance of Il trovatore in the Marx Brothers film A Night at the Opera (including a quotation, in the middle of the act 1 overture, of Take Me Out to the Ball Game ). Luchino Visconti used a performance of Il trovatore at La Fenice opera house for the opening sequence of his 1954 film Senso . As Manrico sings his battle cry in \"Di quella pira\", the performance is interrupted by the answering cries of",

Other than full-length opera performance recordings, Domingo has also made many music albums, recording opera arias , live opera performances and concerts, and crossover songs in solo and duet. His albums have simultaneously appeared on Billboard charts of best-selling classical and crossover recordings; contributing to many gold and platinum records and nine Grammy Awards . Below are the lists of his recordings in full-length opera performances, music albums and compilation albums (including concerts) with other singers. However, the lists cannot be used to reflect his total number of performances",
