      "text": "Anne Perry (born Juliet Marion Hulme ; 28 October 1938 – 10 April 2023) was a British writer and convicted murderer. She was the author of the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt and William Monk series of historical detective fiction . In 1994, it became public knowledge that Perry had been convicted of murder in Christchurch , New Zealand in 1954 when she was fifteen. She and her sixteen-year-old friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker's mother, Honorah . After serving a five-year sentence for the murder, Perry changed her name from Juliet Hulme and returned to the United Kingdom. She was identified by the media following the release of the film Heavenly Creatures , directed by Peter Jackson , which is based on the case. Early life Juliet Marion Hulme was born on 28 October 1938 in London, the second child and first daughter of physicist Henry Rainsford Hulme . Hulme was diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child and sent to the Caribbean , South Africa, and New Zealand in hopes that a warmer climate would improve her health. She rejoined her family after her father took a position as rector of Canterbury University College in New Zealand. She attended Christchurch Girls' High School , located in what became the Cranmer Centre . A 1948 Auckland Star photograph of Hulme arriving in New Zealand was discovered by Auckland Libraries staff in 2012 and written about in the Heritage et AL blog. Murder and trial In",

      "text": "years later. At the time of Perry's death in 2023, Parker and Perry were not believed to have had any contact since the trial. The events formed the basis for the 1994 film Heavenly Creatures , in which Melanie Lynskey portrayed a teenaged Pauline Parker and Kate Winslet played the teenaged Juliet Hulme. At the time of the film's release, it was not generally known that Anne Perry was Juliet Hulme; her identity was made public after journalists tracked her down some months after the film's release. Although some presumed Hulme and Parker's relationship to be sexual, Perry stated in 2006 that, while the relationship was obsessive, the two \"were never lesbians\". Later life After being released from prison in November 1959, Perry returned to England and became a flight attendant . For a period she lived in the United States, where she joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1968. She later settled in the Scottish village of Portmahomack , where she lived with her mother. Her father had a distinguished scientific career, heading the British hydrogen bomb programme . Hulme took the name Anne Perry, using her stepfather's surname. Her first novel, The Cater Street Hangman , was published under this name in 1979. Her works generally fall into one of several categories of genre fiction , including historical murder mysteries and detective fiction . Many feature recurring characters, most importantly Thomas and Charlotte Pitt ,",

      "text": "girls were both so absorbed by their roles that they kept on acting as Pauline and Juliet after the filming was done, as is described on Jackson's website.  Principal photography The entire film was shot on location in Christchurch in 1993. Jackson has been quoted as saying \" Heavenly Creatures is based on a true story, and as such I felt it important to shoot the movie on locations where the actual events took place.\" Post-production The visual effects in the film were handled by the then newly created Weta Digital . The girls' fantasy life, and the ‘Borovnian’ extras (the characters the girls made up) were supervised by Richard Taylor while the digital effects were supervised by George Port. Taylor and his team constructed more than 70 full-sized latex costumes to represent the Borovnian crowds—plasticine figures that inhabit Pauline and Juliet's magical fantasy world. Heavenly Creatures contains more than thirty shots that were digitally manipulated, ranging from the morphing garden of the ‘Fourth World’ to castles in fields and the sequences with \" Orson Welles \" (played by Jean Guérin).
