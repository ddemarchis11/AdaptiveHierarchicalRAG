New York Times critic Edward Rothstein described it as a \"museum about museums\", \"where the persistent question is: what kind of place is this?\" Smithsonian magazine called it \"a witty, self-conscious homage to private museums of yore . . . when natural history was only barely charted by science, and museums were closer to Renaissance cabinets of curiosity.\" In a similar vein, The Economist said the museum \"captures a time chronicled in Richard Holmes 's recent book The Age of Wonder , when science mingled with poetry in its pursuit of answers to life's mysterious questions.\" Lawrence Weschler 's 1995 book, Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, And Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology , attempts to explain the mystery of the Museum of Jurassic Technology. Weschler deeply explores the museum through conversations with its founder, David Wilson , and through outside research on several exhibitions. His investigations into the history of certain exhibits led to varying results of authenticity; some exhibits seem to have been created by Wilson's imagination while other exhibits might be suitable for display in a natural history museum. The Museum of Jurassic Technology at its heart, according to Wilson, is \"a museum interested in presenting phenomena that other natural history museums are unwilling to present.\" The museum's introductory slideshow recounts that \"In its original sense, the",

While it calls itself \"an educational institution dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and the public appreciation of the Lower Jurassic\", the relevance of the term \" Lower Jurassic \" to the museum's collections is left unexplained, and \"Jurassic Technology\" is likewise undefined (the dawn of technology generally being understood as occurring millions of years after the Jurassic).

The factual claims of many of the museum's exhibits strain credibility, provoking an array of interpretations. David Hildebrand Wilson received a MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 2001. On July 8, 2025, a fire broke out in the museum, causing significant smoke damage to several exhibits. The museum reopened in early August 2025.
