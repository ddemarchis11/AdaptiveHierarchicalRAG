      "text": "\" At Long Last Leave \" is the fourteenth episode of the twenty-third season of the American animated television series The Simpsons , and the 500th episode overall of the series. In this episode, the Simpsons discover that the inhabitants of Springfield have grown tired of them and have secretly decided to throw them out of the city. After being evicted from Springfield, the family members end up in a rugged place without rules and regulations called the Outlands. There, they briefly come across their neighbor Julian Assange , who created WikiLeaks . Assange guest-starred in the episode as himself and recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in Britain, while waiting for the results of Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority . Michael Price wrote the episode without the intention of it becoming the 500th episode and felt honored when it was selected for the milestone. Television critics have given the episode generally positive reviews, particularly praising it for a montage of the series' couch gags that was included in the opening sequence . The storyline of \"At Long Last Leave\" has, however, received criticism for being similar to the main story structure previously done in The Simpsons Movie . During its original airing on the Fox network in the United States on February 19, 2012, the episode was watched by about 5.77 million people and received a 2.6 Nielsen rating in the demographic for adults aged 18–49 . Before this broadcast, Fox promoted the 500th episode milestone by arranging an attempt to break",

Production Julian Assange , the founder of website WikiLeaks , appeared in the episode. \"At Long Last Leave\", which is the 500th episode of The Simpsons , was written by Michael Price . The Simpsons ' showrunner Al Jean has described it as \"a tribute to people who love the show.\" Being a fan of musical theater, Price titled the episode in reference to the Cole Porter song \" At Long Last Love \". Price did not write \"At Long Last Leave\" with the intention of it becoming the 500th episode; that decision was made afterwards when the staff members realized the story offered an opportunity for a look-back at the history of the Simpson family. He said in an interview with the magazine Channel Guide that he was \"deeply honored\" when his episode was selected for the milestone. As acknowledged by Price in that interview, the plot of the episode features similarities to the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie , in which the Simpsons are forced to flee to Alaska after Homer angers the townspeople in Springfield by polluting a lake. However, Price commented that \"I think it's different from the movie in that it sort of does reference back the entire history of the show, the collective experience of Springfield vis-a-vis the Simpsons, whereas the movie they were forced to run away due to that very specific thing\". He further noted that despite the similarities \"we",
