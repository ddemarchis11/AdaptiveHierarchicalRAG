      "text": "Vinylmation is a brand of 1.5\", 3\", and 9\" vinyl collectible toys sold at Disney theme parks , select Disney Stores , and the online Disney Store. The name Vinylmation is a combination of the word Animation and Vinyl . Most figures are all shaped with the body of Mickey Mouse but have different themed markings, colors, and patterns. This means that all figures have round mouse ears, whether or not the painted character has them. This is accommodated by painting the ears with backgrounds - stars, stripes, rainbows - to match the painted character. The series exception is the Park Starz series which does not resemble Mickey at all, and more closely resembles iconic figures from the parks. Vinylmation was first introduced in July 2008, and the first figures were introduced in November 2008. After a surge of releases between 2010 and 2014, the toy line began to decline around 2015, and ceased production until a 2022 revival. Trading Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resorts have recently [ when? ] stopped official trading because vinylmations are considered \"collectibles\" not \"traders\".

The last regular installment of the Mickey Mouse film series came in 1953 with The Simple Things in which Mickey and Pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls . Television and later films Mickey Mouse as he appears in the modern era In the 1950s, Mickey became more known for his appearances on television, particularly with The Mickey Mouse Club . Many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series such as Ink & Paint Club , various forms of the Walt Disney anthology television series , and on home video. Mickey returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with Mickey's Christmas Carol , an adaptation of Charles Dickens ' A Christmas Carol in which Mickey played Bob Cratchit . This was followed up in 1990 with The Prince and the Pauper . Throughout the decades, Mickey Mouse competed with Warner Bros.' Bugs Bunny for animated popularity. But in 1988, the two rivals finally shared screen time in the Robert Zemeckis Touchstone Pictures / Amblin Entertainment film Who Framed Roger Rabbit . Disney and Warner signed an agreement stating that each character had the same amount of screen time in the scene. Similar to his animated inclusion into a live-action film in Roger Rabbit , Mickey made a featured cameo appearance in the 1990 television special The Muppets at Walt Disney World where he met Kermit the Frog .

Parodies and criticism The 1969 underground protest cartoon Mickey Mouse in Vietnam Mickey Mouse's global fame has made him both a symbol of the Walt Disney Company and of the United States itself. For this reason, Mickey has been used frequently in anti-establishment or anti-American satire, such as the infamous underground cartoon Mickey Mouse in Vietnam (1969) and the Palestinian children's propaganda series Tomorrow's Pioneers where a Mickey Mouse-esque character named Farfour is used to promote Islamic extremism. There have been numerous parodies of Mickey Mouse, such as the two-page parody \"Mickey Rodent\" by Will Elder (published in Mad #19, 1955) in which the mouse walks around unshaven and jails Donald Duck out of jealousy over the duck's larger popularity. In The Simpsons Movie , Bart Simpson puts a black bra on his head to mimic Mickey Mouse and says: \"I'm the mascot of an evil corporation !\" The Simpsons would later become Disney property as its distributor Fox was acquired by Disney. In the Comedy Central series South Park , Mickey (voiced by Trey Parker ) serves as a recurring antagonist, depicted as the sadistic, greedy, and foul-mouthed boss of the Walt Disney Company. He also appears briefly with Donald Duck in the comic Squeak the Mouse by Italian cartoonist Massimo Mattioli . Mickey Mouse has also been particularly commented upon in the context of fascism and antisemitism in Germany . A pro- Nazi newspaper in the",

      "text": "Mickey Mouse is a cartoon character co-created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks . The longtime icon and mascot of the Walt Disney Company , Mickey is an anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large shoes, and white gloves. He is often depicted with a cast of characters including his girlfriend Minnie Mouse , his pet dog Pluto , his best friends Donald Duck and Goofy , and his nemesis Pete . Regarded as a global icon of animation, Time has named Mickey one of the most famous cultural symbols of the 20th and 21st centuries. Mickey was created as a replacement for a prior Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit . The character was originally to be named \"Mortimer Mouse\", until Disney's wife, Lillian , suggested \"Mickey\". Mickey first appeared in two 1928 shorts Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho (which were not picked up for distribution) before his public debut in Steamboat Willie (1928). The character went on to appear in over 130 films, mostly shorts as well as features such as Fantasia (1940). Since 1930, Mickey has been featured extensively in comic strips (including the Mickey Mouse comic strip , which ran for 45 years) and comic books (such as Mickey Mouse ). The character has also been featured in television series such as The Mickey Mouse Club (1955–1996). Inspired by such silent film personalities as Charlie Chaplin and",

      "text": ". Mickey Mouse has also been particularly commented upon in the context of fascism and antisemitism in Germany . A pro- Nazi newspaper in the mid-1930s denounced Disney's use of \"the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom\" as evidence of the \"Jewish brutalization of the people\". Artist Horst Rosenthal created a comic book, Mickey au Camp de Gurs ( Mickey Mouse in the Gurs Internment Camp ) while detained in the Gurs internment camp , subtitled \"Publié Sans Autorisation de Walt Disney\" (\"Published without Walt Disney's Permission\"); Rosenthal's Mickey names Walt Disney as his father, but is sorted into the camps as a Jew after being unable to name a mother, a seeming parody of both Disney's rumoured antisemitism and of the American public's ignorance around racial divisions in Europe. Cartoonist Art Spiegelman adapted Nazi descriptions of Jews as rodents and vermin for his graphic novel Maus ; The original three-page strip uses a young Mickey Mouse as a stand-in for Spiegelman, listening to tales of \" Mauschwitz \" and the Holocaust told by his father Vladek. The full 1991 adaptation of the strip uses a comparatively direct anthropomorphization of Spiegelman, but otherwise continues to use Mickey Mouse imagery to connect contemporary America to the genocide. In the 1969 parody novel Bored of the Rings , Mickey Mouse is satirized as Dickey Dragon. Legal issues",

      "text": "1930. The storyline was completed on September 20, 1930, and later reprinted in comic book form as Mickey Mouse in Death Valley . This early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included Mickey and Minnie. Among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, and Black Pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer Sylvester Shyster and Minnie's uncle Mortimer Mouse . The Death Valley narrative was followed by Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers , first printed between September 22 and December 26, 1930, which introduced Marcus Mouse and his wife as Minnie's parents. Starting with these two early comic strip stories, Mickey's versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other. While Disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy, the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure. This adventurous version of Mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the 20th and into the 21st century. Floyd Gottfredson left his mark with stories such as Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion (1936) and The Gleam (1942). He also created the Phantom Blot , Eega Beeva , Morty and Ferdie, Captain Churchmouse, and Butch. Besides Gottfredson artists for the strip over the years included Roman Arambula, Rick",
