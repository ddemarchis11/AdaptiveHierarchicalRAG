Kiwi (voiced by C. H. Greenblatt) is a photorealistic pink creature who sometimes gives usually useless advice to Chowder and other characters and occasionally provides interstitial narrations, especially at times where particularly corny humor is displayed. Production Development The puppet versions of the characters Chowder (a Hand-Rod puppet) and Mung Daal During his time working on Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants , Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept. Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as The Sword in the Stone . The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy. Some of the inspiration comes from Dr. Seuss , with other inspiration from Saturday morning cartoons . Greenblatt pitched the",

Although his exact age has not been stated, he has mentioned that he has cooked for at least 386 years, and he celebrated 450 years of marriage to Truffles. He likes to impress ladies to the point where as a child apprentice, he prepared a dish incorrectly due to becoming distracted. He is a light blue-colored humanoid with an oversized nose, ears, and a white mustache. He is named after the Indian dish mung daal . Greenblatt had originally planned to give Mung an Indian accent, but later decided against it. Truffles (voiced by Tara Strong ): A mushroom pixie / fairy and Mung Daal's wife who handles the business side of Mung's catering business. She is an extreme choleric . Greenblatt said that he based Truffles on his mother. Greenblatt said that he initially found difficulty in working on any story with Truffles since the character could be \"so abrasive\" that the Chowder staff had to be \"a little more sensitive about finding her softer side.\" Greenblatt said that the staff eventually decided that \"a little Truffles goes a long way.
