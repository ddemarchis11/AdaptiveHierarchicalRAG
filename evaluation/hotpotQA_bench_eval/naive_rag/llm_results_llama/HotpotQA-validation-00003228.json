Several of these are monophagous , meaning their caterpillars only feed on this genus, sometimes just on a single taxon of Eriogonum . Wild buckwheat flowers are also an important source of food for these and other Lepidoptera. In some cases, the relationship is so close that Eriogonum and dependent Lepidoptera are in danger of coextinction . Monophagous Lepidoptera on wild buckwheat include: Apodemia mormo (Mormon metalmark) – feeds exclusively on Eriogonum Apodemia mormo langei (Lange's metalmark) – only known from Eriogonum nudum ssp. auriculatum Chionodes dammersi – feeds exclusively on Eriogonum Chionodes luteogeminatus – only known from Eriogonum niveum Euphilotes enoptes smithi ( Smith's blue butterfly ) – only known from Eriogonum latifolium and Eriogonum parvifolium Euphilotes battoides allyni ( El Segundo blue butterfly ) - only known from Eriogonum parvifolium Additionally, bees",

The 22-spot ladybird is also commonly found eating mildew on these plants. Uses Many members of this family are cultivated for various purposes. Parsnip ( Pastinaca sativa ), carrot ( Daucus carota ) and Hamburg parsley ( Petroselinum crispum ) produce tap roots that are large enough to be useful as food. Many species produce essential oils in their leaves or fruits and as a result are flavourful aromatic herbs. Examples are parsley ( Petroselinum crispum ), coriander ( Coriandrum sativum ), culantro , and dill ( Anethum graveolens ).

It is native to the Klamath Mountains of northern California and southern Oregon , where it is an uncommon member of plant communities on serpentine soils . This is a small dioecious shrub forming low, thick mats rarely exceeding 20 centimeters in height. The curving, oval-shaped leaves are woolly and greenish gray in color, growing up to two centimeters long. The plant flowers in yellow to reddish rounded inflorescences , male plants producing clusters of staminate flowers, and female plants producing larger clusters of pistillate flowers.

      "text": "Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae . The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat . This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing. It includes some common wildflowers , such as the California buckwheat ( Eriogonum fasciculatum ). The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux , explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus ( E. tomentosum ) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ( \"planta lanata, geniculata\" ). Despite sharing the common name \"buckwheat\", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat . In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened. One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat ( Eriogonum truncatum , believed to be extinct) was rediscovered. Ecology Eriogonum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). An example of a butterfly that uses this plant for food is the",
