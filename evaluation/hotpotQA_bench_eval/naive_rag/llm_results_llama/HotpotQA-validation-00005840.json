Avatar has published the bulk of Ennis's creator-owned material, which includes the post-9/11 war story 303 , a western entitled Streets of Glory , the extreme horror comic Crossed , Back to Brooklyn , a crime limited series co-written with Jimmy Palmiotti for Image Comics , Caliban , a science fiction horror series inspired by the movie Prometheus , and Chronicles of Wormwood , which dealt with the friendship between an African-American Jesus Christ and a benign Antichrist . In 2011, Avatar commissioned Ennis to write and direct an original short film, Stitched , produced to drum up support for a possible feature. Ennis was also the initial writer for the Stitched comic book tie-in, also published by Avatar. Ennis has also done both creator-owned and commissioned work for Dynamite Entertainment , most notably The Boys .

Mr. Glass's wig was modeled after Afro-American statesman Frederick Douglass . Shyamalan said that he wanted to market Unbreakable as a comic book movie , but Disney—which had not yet bought Marvel Comics —preferred to advertise it as a supernatural thriller like The Sixth Sense . More than 15 minutes of footage was deleted during post-production of Unbreakable . These scenes are available on the DVD release. Soundtrack James Newton Howard was approached by Shyamalan to work on Unbreakable immediately after scoring The Sixth Sense . It was recorded at AIR Studios Lyndhurst Hall , a converted church in London. Comic book references Filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith felt Unbreakable was briefly similar to a comic book titled Mage: The Hero Discovered , written and illustrated by Matt Wagner . As in comic books, the main characters have their identified color schemes and aliases. David's are green and \"Security\" or \"Hero\", while Elijah's are purple and \"Mr. Glass\".
