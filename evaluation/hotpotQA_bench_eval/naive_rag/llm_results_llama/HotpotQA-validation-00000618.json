      "text": "The Pennacook , also known by the names Penacook and Pennacock , were Algonquian Indigenous people who lived in what is now Massachusetts , New Hampshire , and southern Maine . They were not a united tribe but a network of politically and culturally allied communities. Penacook was also the name of a specific Native village in what is now Concord, New Hampshire . The Pennacook were related to but not a part of the original Wabanaki Confederacy , which includes the Miꞌkmaq , Maliseet , Passamaquoddy , and Penobscot peoples. Name Pennacook is also written as Penacook and Pennacock. The name Pennacook roughly translates (based on Abenaki cognates) as \"at the bottom of the hill.\" Territory Historian David Stewart-Smith suggests that the Penacook were Central Abenaki people. Their southern neighbors were the Massachusett and Wampanoag . Pennacook territory bordered the Connecticut River in the West, Lake Winnipesauke in the north, the Piscataqua to the east, and the villages of the closely allied Pawtucket confederation along the southern Merrimack River to the south. The Pennacook homeland was built around the upper Merrimack and the major towns at Amoskeag Falls (now Manchester) and Pennacook (now Concord ), which served as major population hubs and later fallback centers for people across",

      "text": "The Lochmere Archeological District is a large archeological area on the banks of the Winnipesaukee River in Belknap County, New Hampshire , near the village of Lochmere . The area, part of which is now preserved by the state as the Brennick Lochmere Archaeological Site , is a multi-component site with evidence of human occupation from the Middle Archaic through the Late Woodland periods. The site was occupied in historic times by the Winnipesaukee sub-tribe of the Pennacook people, and is near Aquadoctan (aka The Weirs), one of the largest native towns of prehistoric New Hampshire. The district also encompasses a number of archaeologically sensitive historic sites that were developed by white settlers and later residents to take advantage of the river's water power for industrial purposes. These uses began as early as the 1770s and continued into the 19th century, when the proprietors of the area's mills contested with the wealthier owners of downstream mills in Manchester, New Hampshire , Lowell, Massachusetts , and other sites on the Merrimack River for control over the river's flow. These well-funded interests eventually purchased all of the major water rights in the area, and shut the smaller area mills down, and by 1882 most of them lay in ruins. About 90 acres (36 ha) of the area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, an area that includes 13 prehistoric",

The bridge was built about 1896-7 by the Boston and Maine Railroad , replacing a standard trestle bridge built in 1892 by the Franklin and Tilton Railroad . The bridge acquired its name for the large amount of sulfite carried by the rail line to paper mills in Franklin. The mills, which were the principal users of the line, closed in the 1920s, and another covered bridge on the line, crossing the Merrimack River , was washed away by flooding in 1936. The railroad line was shut down entirely in 1973. The bridge is believed to be the only surviving \"upside down\" covered railroad bridge, in which the rail bed is laid on top of the bridge roof, whose purpose is to shelter the trusses below.

This group inhabited fortified villages in what is today the northeastern portion of the U.S. state of Arkansas . The tribe takes its name from the chieftain Pacaha (born in the early 16th century), who ruled the tribe from its primary village on the Mississippi River , which was thought to be located in present-day Crittenden County, Arkansas near Turrell . The site, part of the Nodena phase , is known to archaeologists as \"The Bradley Site\". Information about Chief Pacaha and his people comes from journals made during the expedition of Hernando De Soto in 1541. The de Soto expedition stayed at Pacaha's village for approximately 40 days. De Soto expedition The initial encounter between the Pacaha and the de Soto expedition was violent. Chief Pacaha's tribe had been at war for some time with a neighboring chieftain named Casqui .
