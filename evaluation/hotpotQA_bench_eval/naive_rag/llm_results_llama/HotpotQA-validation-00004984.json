      "text": "of argon-40 is due mostly to the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the time since the formation of the Earth. Little of the atmospheric argon is primordial. Helium-4 is produced by alpha decay, and the helium trapped in Earth's crust is also mostly non-primordial . In other types of radioactive decay, such as cluster decay , larger species of nuclei are ejected (for example, neon-20 ), and these eventually become newly-formed stable atoms. Radioactive decay may lead to spontaneous fission . This is not cluster decay , as the fission products may be split among nearly any type of atom. Thorium-232 , uranium-235 , and uranium-238 are primordial isotopes that undergo spontaneous fission. Natural technetium and promethium are produced in this manner. Nuclear reactions : Naturally-occurring nuclear reactions powered by radioactive decay give rise to so-called nucleogenic nuclides. This process happens when an energetic particle from radioactive decay, often an alpha particle , reacts with a nucleus of another atom to change the nucleus into another nuclide. This process may also cause the production of further subatomic particles, such as neutrons. Neutrons can also be produced in spontaneous fission and by neutron emission . These neutrons can then go on to produce other nuclides via neutron-induced fission, or by neutron capture . For example, some stable isotopes such as neon-21 and neon-22 are produced by several",

      "text": "Caesium-137 ( 137 55 Cs ), cesium-137 (US), or radiocaesium , is a radioactive isotope of caesium that is formed as one of the more common fission products by the nuclear fission of uranium-235 and other fissionable isotopes in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons . Trace quantities also originate from spontaneous fission of uranium-238 . It is among the most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products. Caesium has a relatively low boiling point of 671 °C (1,240 °F) and easily becomes volatile when released suddenly at high temperature, as in the case of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and with nuclear explosions , and can travel very long distances in the air. After being deposited onto the soil as radioactive fallout , it moves and spreads easily in the environment because of the high water solubility of caesium 's most common chemical compounds , which are salts . Caesium-137 was discovered by Glenn T. Seaborg and Margaret Melhase . Decay 137 Cs decay scheme showing half-lives , daughter nuclides , and types and proportion of radiation emitted. 137 Cs gamma spectrum. The characteristic 662 keV peak does not originate directly from 137 Cs , but from the decay of 137m Ba to its stable state. Caesium-137 has a half-life of about 30.04 years, decaying by beta emission to stable barium-137 .",
