      "text": "Orfeo ed Euridice ( Italian: [orˈfɛːo ed euriˈdiːtʃe] ; French : Orphée et Eurydice ; English: Orpheus and Eurydice ) is an opera composed by Christoph Willibald Gluck , based on the myth of Orpheus and set to a libretto by Ranieri de' Calzabigi . It belongs to the genre of the azione teatrale , meaning an opera on a mythological subject with choruses and dancing. The piece was first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 5 October 1762, in the presence of Empress Maria Theresa . Orfeo ed Euridice is the first of Gluck's \"reform\" operas, in which he attempted to replace the abstruse plots and overly complex music of opera seria with a \"noble simplicity\" in both the music and the drama. The opera is the most popular of Gluck's works, and was one of the most influential on subsequent German operas . Variations on its plot—the underground rescue mission in which the hero must control, or conceal, his emotions—can be found in Mozart 's The Magic Flute , Beethoven 's Fidelio , and Wagner 's Das Rheingold . Though originally set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to the genre of",

It is the third of Gluck's so-called reform operas for Vienna, following Orfeo ed Euridice and Alceste , and the least often performed of the three. Like its predecessors, the libretto was written by Ranieri de' Calzabigi . The opera tells the story of the events between the Judgment of Paris and the flight of Paris and Helen to Troy . It was premiered at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 3 November 1770. Roles Synopsis The hero Paris is in Sparta , having chosen Aphrodite above Hera and Athena , sacrificing to Aphrodite and seeking, with the encouragement of Erasto, the love of Helen . Paris and Helen meet at her royal palace and each is struck by the other's beauty. She calls on him to judge an athletic contest and when asked to sing he does so in praise of her beauty, admitting the purpose of his visit is to win her love. She dismisses him. In despair Paris pleads with her, and she begins to give way. Eventually, through the intervention of Erasto, who reveals himself as Cupid , she gives way, but Pallas Athene (Athena) warns them of sorrow to come. In the final scene Paris and Helen make ready to",

      "text": "Romolo ed Ersilia is a three-act opera composed by Johann Adolph Hasse to an Italian-language libretto by Pietro Metastasio . The opera was commissioned by Empress Maria Theresa to celebrate the marriage of her son Leopold to Maria Luisa of Spain . The opera was first performed on 6 August 1765, the day after their wedding, in the court theatre of the Imperial Palace in Innsbruck . The opera received its first performance in modern times in 2011 during the Innsbruck Festival of Early Music . The opera is loosely based on The Rape of the Sabine Women , an episode in the legendary history of Rome , traditionally dated to 750 BC. The opera's main protagonists are Romolo ( Romulus , the founder and ruler of Rome) and Ersilia ( Hersilia , who became the wife of Romulus). The same libretto was set eight years later by Josef Mysliveček and again titled Romolo ed Ersilia . The libretto also formed the basis for a 1780 ballet d'action choreographed by Charles Le Picq to music by Martín y Soler and entitled Il ratto delle Sabine . An opera entitled Romolo ed Ersilia is the opera seria which is parodied as the \"opera within an opera\" in Donizetti 's Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali .

Gluck's reforms, which began with Orfeo ed Euridice , have had significant influence throughout operatic history. Gluck's ideals heavily influenced the popular works of Mozart , Wagner , and Weber , with Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk vision especially influenced by that of Gluck. Old-style opera seria and the domination of embellishment -orientated singers came to be increasingly unpopular after the success of Gluck's operas as a whole and Orfeo in particular. In Orfeo ed Euridice the orchestra is far more predominant than in earlier opera, most notably in Orfeo's arioso \"Che puro ciel\". Here the voice is reduced to the comparatively minor role of recitative-style declamation, while the oboe carries the main melody, supported by solos from the flute, cello, bassoon, and horn. There is also accompaniment from the strings (playing in triplets) and the continuo in the most complex orchestration that Gluck ever wrote. Orchestration Gluck made a number of changes to the orchestration of Orfeo when adapting it from the original Italian version to the French version",
