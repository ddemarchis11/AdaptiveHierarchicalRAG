  "gold_answer": "New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the Falkland Islands, and Peru.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, it appears that the Forests of Mara and Mondrem shared a common deer species with other areas in Cheshire, England. The evidence mentions that the Forests of Mara and Mondrem included red, fallow, and roe deer. \n\nHowever, the evidence does not specifically mention other areas that share a common deer species with the Forests of Mara and Mondrem.",

      "text": "The Forests of Mara and Mondrem were adjacent medieval forests in Cheshire , England, which in the 11th century extended to over 60 square miles (160 km 2 ), stretching from the Mersey in the north almost to Nantwich in the south, and from the Gowy in the west to the Weaver in the east. Mara and Mondrem were a hunting forest of the Norman Earls of Chester , established soon after 1071 by the first earl, Hugh d'Avranches . They might earlier have been an Anglo-Saxon hunting forest. Game included wild boar , and red , fallow and roe deer. After the earldom lapsed in 1237, the forest rights passed to the Crown, with the monarch's heir being given the title of Earl of Chester. Edward I and James I both hunted in the forests. Clearance for agricultural use began to be permitted after 1215, and by the mid-14th century, large areas of the Forest of Mondrem had been cleared. Deer hunting still continued within the remaining forest in the 17th century, and the forest was not formally disafforested, or removed from forest law , until 1812. The modern Delamere Forest is the remnant of the medieval forests, but little ancient woodland survives.

The total extent was over 60 square miles (160 km 2 ). An undated document quoted by Ormerod lists 62 townships and villages within the two forests (although several of these places were exempt from forest law); as the document mentions Vale Royal Abbey , this must refer to some time between the abbey's foundation in 1277 and its dissolution in 1536. The precise boundary between the two adjacent forests is uncertain, but the Forest of Mara probably extended from the Mersey to the south of the area now known as Delamere Forest , while the Forest of Mondrem occupied the area between Delamere and Nantwich. The boundary might have coincided with a road known as \"Peytevinisti\" or \"Peytefynsty\", which also defined the limit of the grazing rights of Vale Royal Abbey; this is believed to have run from Weaverham in the north through Cuddington to Tarporley in the south.

      "text": "The Forests of Mara and Mondrem together formed one of the three hunting forests of the Earls of Chester , the others being the Forests of Macclesfield and Wirral . It was created by Hugh d'Avranches , a keen huntsman, soon after he became Earl of Chester in 1071, although the area might have been an Anglo-Saxon hunting forest before the Norman Conquest . \"Forest\", in this context, means an area outside the common law and subject to forest law ; it does not imply that the area was entirely wooded, and the land remained largely in private ownership. The forest boundary was marked with \"irremovable marks, meres and boundaries\", and the entire area also appears to have been enclosed. Game was hunted with dogs and included wild boar , and red , fallow and roe deer. The original woodland was mixed, predominantly oak , but also including elm , lime , yew , chestnut , fir , larch , beech , ash , silver birch , hazel , willow and alder . The forest area also encompassed heath and wetland , as well as pasture, arable land and even small settlements. Agriculture was, however, allowed within the forest boundaries only under severe restrictions; assarting , or enclosing and clearing new land for agriculture, was completely prohibited until 1215–16. During the early Norman period, the penalties for killing game were blinding, mutilation or",

      "text": ". After the Earls After the lapse of the Chester earldom in 1237, the forest rights passed to the Crown and the monarch's heir was given the title of Earl of Chester. Although Edward I hunted in the forest, the sport became less important, and the forests were used for timber production and as a source of revenue from taxes, fees and fines. In 1300, Edward I confirmed Ranulf de Blondeville's charter of 1215–16, but in the mid-14th century, Edward of Woodstock , the Black Prince, introduced various restrictive measures, which led to a large number of complaints recorded in the Black Prince's Register of 1351. Agricultural exploitation of the eastern edge of the forest was hampered by outbreaks of Black Death at Over , Little Budworth and Vale Royal Abbey in 1349, 1361 and 1369. The Old Pale and Eddisbury Hill were enclosed in the 14th century, to retain deer. Sir John Done, Master-Forester, was knighted by James I after he hunted at the forest in 1617. The northerly Forest of Mara remained wooded in the 14th century, and still retained a population of wild boar, lynx and wolves . By that date, however, large areas of the southerly Forest of Mondrem had been cleared. The remaining Mondrem woodland in the mid-14th century appears to have been concentrated in the",

The position was symbolised by a black horn, which was given to the Kingsleys in the 12th century; now known as the \"Delamere Horn\", it is in the collection of the Grosvenor Museum . The master-foresters answered to the Chester justiciar , who was responsible for the administration of forest law across all three Cheshire forests. The privileges claimed by the Mara and Mondrem master-forester were set out in detail by Richard Done in the 14th century. They included the right shoulder of all deer killed in hunting; windfallen and felled timber within the demesne wood; swarms of bees, sparrowhawks, merlins and hobbies found throughout the forest; and the right of pannage , or feeding pigs in the forest. He also claimed halfpence per head of cattle and goats found straying within the forest between Michaelmas and Martinmas , the payments made for the agistment of hogs between Martinmas and Christmas, as well as the pick of the property forfeited by poachers.
