      "text": "Hostage for a Day is a 1994 Canadian television comedy film directed by John Candy , in his only directorial effort. Though the film is also billed as \"starring\" Candy, he in fact plays only a minor role, as a Russian hostage taker. Produced with a mostly Canadian cast, the film was released one month after Candy's death. Plot Forty one year old copy shop worker Warren Kooey begins having a mid-life crisis . His plans are to take a trip to the state of Alaska , but his plans are derailed after his wife drains his entire bank account (approximately $40,000) to pay for a remodelling job by famous home builder and blond, long haired Italian heartthrob \"Hondo.\" In order to recuperate his money Kooey decides to pose as being held hostage by an imaginary Russian terrorist, and calls the SWAT Team on himself in an effort to extort $50,000 (to Kooey's disappointment, the incompetent SWAT team has suffered major budget cuts). Things take a turn for the worse, when Russian terrorist Yuri Petrovich takes Kooey hostage. Cast George Wendt as Warren Kooey John Vernon as V.D. Regan Robin Duke as Elizabeth Kooey Peter Torokvei as Ronny Kathleen Laskey as Jackie Don Lake as Lt.

In May 2006, Candy became one of the first four entertainers ever honoured by Canada Post by being featured on a postage stamp. On October 31, 2020, Toronto Mayor John Tory proclaimed \"John Candy Day\" in honor of what would have been Candy's 70th birthday. Blues Brothers 2000 is dedicated to three people, including Candy, who played a supporting role in the original Blues Brothers . A tribute to Candy was hosted by Dan Aykroyd at the 2007 Grey Cup festivities in Toronto in November 2007. Experimental rock band Ween 's album Chocolate and Cheese , released in 1994, is \"dedicated in loving memory to John Candy (1950–1994)\". At the time, lead singer Gene Ween remarked, \"There was so much going on about Kurt Cobain , and nobody mentioned John Candy at all. I have a special little spot in my heart for him.\" After his death, the John Candy Visual Arts Studio at Neil McNeil Catholic High School in Toronto was dedicated in his honour. Candy, one of the school's most famous alumni, said during one of his annual visits to the school: \"My success is simply rooted in the values and discipline and respect for others that I was taught at Neil McNeil.\" It has been suggested that the Canadian Screen Awards be given the official nickname \"The Candys\", both",

Eliyahu had been at odds with Daniel and Dorit for many years, and hated Dorit for not having an abortion and, in his opinion, ruining Daniel's life and burying his career. Eliyahu's wife Roda ( Rina Schenfeld ) is in a coma in their elderly home, with no chance of recovery. She was the daughter of a British lord and inherited his estate in Israel, while her brother Michael Simpson ( Patrick Stewart ), broke because he chose to be a theater actor to the chagrin of their father, seeks to take Roda off life support and get the estate. The estate had in fact already been sold by Eliyahu to pay for Roda's lengthy hospitalization and a home for himself and Nick. To solve their financial problems, Jonathan, Michael, Eliyahu and Nick plan to rob the bank where Daniel worked, being intimately familiar with the bank's defense systems. They stage a number of diversions which causes the bank to turn off one of the main alarm systems, allowing them to enter the safe. The first plan goes awry when Nick, who was supposed to be a hostage himself, takes a guard's gun and his own hostages, but he is not sent to prison because of his dementia . Eliyahu then robs the bank himself, and Jonathan, pretending to be a victim, burns some of the money in front of the police, allowing him to get away with most",
