Employing about 1,400 workers, it was managed by Hornsby Sr's two other sons – James and William. Throughout the First World War, Hornsbys were seconded to producing munitions and engines for the Admiralty . This left them little room for marketing or manufacturing other products – often needing years of development. The management realised their future was in doubt, so looked for a suitable company to combine with: the management chose Ruston. On 11 September 1918, employing about 3,000 people at the time, the company was bought out by Ruston & Proctor of Lincoln . Surviving machines Hornsby Tractor acquired 1909 by the British Army (preserved in running order at The Tank Museum , Bovington) Very few of the early machines built by Richard Hornsby & Co. survive, but examples of the major types are still to be found. A working example of a Hornsby Oil tractor can be seen at some vintage vehicle shows in the UK, and another example is under restoration in Australia.

St Vincents Hall is a Gothic Revival mansion in Grantham , Lincolnshire , England. It is a Grade II listed building . History The house was designed in the Gothic Revival style and built for the industrialist Richard Hornsby , who founded Richard Hornsby & Sons , an engine and machinery manufacturer, in 1868. The Hornsby family sold the property to the Paravicini family before the building was sold to the Air Ministry . The 1920s witnessed many visitors including Tsar Nicholas of Russia's brother fleeing the Bolsheviks. St Vincents Hall is best known for being the Second World War HQ of 5 Group Bomber Command between October 1937 and November 1943 and was where Operation Chastise of May 1943 – immortalized in The Dam Busters film – was planned. On the night of 16/17 May 1943 Air Marshall Arthur Harris , Barnes Wallis and other RAF high command were in St Vincents Hall when coded radio messages were received confirming that the raid had breached the Möhne and Eder dams. Air Marshall Harris is reputed to have said to Barnes Wallis: \"Wallis, I didn't believe a word you said about this damn bomb, but you could sell me a pink elephant now\".

      "text": "War broke out, Britain had to purchase caterpillar tractors from Holt to tow the Army's heavy guns, and the designers of the tank had to start from scratch, basing their ideas on imported American machines. Hornsby's chain-track played no direct part in the development of the tank, although Lt-Col. R. E. B. Crompton , who later had an important role in its creation, had been present at some of the early trials and was influenced to some extent by the Hornsby. In the event, the first British tanks had no sprung suspension, and the track plates were an improved version of those of another American vehicle, the Bullock tractor. Central to British tank development was William Foster & Co., agricultural machinery manufacturers, based at Lincoln, only about 25 miles from Hornsby's.  First commercial film Trials featuring the Hornsby Tractor and the Rochet-Schneider were the subject of a film that was used in an attempt to promote sales and also shown in cinemas. There was also a screening in the presence of senior British officers and foreign military attachés. World War II On 30 September 1940 seven factory staff were killed in a daylight attack, with 4 high explosive bombs. It was the fifth raid of the war on the town. Ownership After Hornsby's death in 1864, the firm was owned by his son, also Richard. Hornsby Jr died at the age of 50,",
