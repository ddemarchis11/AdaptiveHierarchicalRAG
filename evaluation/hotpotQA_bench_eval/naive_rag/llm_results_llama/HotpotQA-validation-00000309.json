It is located at 10 Richmond Terrace, next to the Richmond County Courthouse and opposite the St. George Terminal of the Staten Island Ferry . Borough Hall houses the Borough President 's office, offices of the Departments of Buildings and Transportation, and other civic offices. The 1906 French Renaissance style brick and limestone building was designed by Carrere and Hastings , following the consolidation of New York City in 1898. John Carrere was a resident of Staten Island and he helped select the dramatic hilltop site of Borough Hall. The interior of the building contains a series of thirteen WPA murals illustrating events in Staten Island history, painted by local artist Frederick Charles Stahr . The building is a New York City Landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Thirty years later, Stahr applied for funding through the Works Progress Administration, and the project was approved in 1936. Working out of a third-floor studio, Stahr created storybook style oil paintings on canvas over the next two years, which were cemented to Borough Hall's walls as he went along. The thirteen murals depict Verrazzano 's discovery of Staten Island in 1524; Henry Hudson 's 1609 visit aboard the Dutch ship Halve Maen ; two panels showing stoic Lenape natives trading furs for trinkets; French Huguenot farmers; British Admiral Howe taking charge of the island in 1776 and creating Fort Hill; the 1776 peace conference among Howe, Benjamin Franklin , John Adams and Edward Rutledge at the Conference House in Tottenville; the so-called Battle of St. Andrew's; British ships departing during Evacuation Day in 1783; the erection of Fort Richmond and Fort Tompkins in anticipation of the War of 1812 ; a stagecoach stopping at the Black Horse Tavern, which had been destroyed to accommodate road widening in 1934, three years prior to the 1937 painting; the Hotel Castleton , run by freed black men in the 19th century and destroyed by fire in 1907; the first Clifton to Tottenville railroad in 1860;",

Newark Bay is connected to Upper New York Bay by the Kill Van Kull and to Raritan Bay by the Arthur Kill . The names of the channels reflect the period of Dutch colonialization . The area around the bay was called Achter Kol , which translates as behind or beyond the ridge and refers to Bergen Hill . The emergence of the Hudson Palisades begins on Bergen Neck , the peninsula between the bay and the Hudson River . Kill in Dutch means stream or channel. During the British colonial era the bay was known as Cull bay . Kill van Kull literally translates as channel from the ridge . Arthur Kill is an anglicization of achter kill meaning back channel , which would speak to its location behind Staten Island.
