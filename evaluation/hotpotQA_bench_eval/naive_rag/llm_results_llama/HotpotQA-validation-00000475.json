Ridley quickly dropped out as main co-host but continued as a regular guest, while Willie Geist was tapped as co-host. The program permanently took over the slot in July 2007, though the decision was not officially announced until October that year. During the first quarter of 2009, Morning Joe earned higher ratings in the age 25-54 demo category than CNN 's competing program, American Morning , but had fewer viewers overall. Both programs finished behind Fox News 's Fox & Friends during the same time period. By March 2010, the show's ratings remained behind those of Fox & Friends , but surpassed its other cable competitors American Morning , Morning Express with Robin Meade , and Squawk Box . Morning Joe continued to regularly place second in total viewers and younger demographic to Fox & Friends , ahead of other cable news competitors including CNN 's New Day . However, Morning Joe ranked behind CNN's counterpart programming during short stints in 2013. Over the years, the program's focus has shifted partly toward enterprise journalism : Scarborough and Brzezinski provide exclusives from the United States Congress , the US State Department , and the White House .

On April 26, 2010, the radio show was placed on \"hiatus\", which Scarborough said was to redevelop its format into a new three-hour show. The show never returned.

History Morning Joe began as a fill-in program after Don Imus ' Imus in the Morning was canceled in April 2007. Former Florida Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough, then host of the primetime MSNBC program Scarborough Country , suggested the idea of doing a morning show instead. He put together what would become Morning Joe with Scarborough Country executive producer Chris Licht and screenwriter John Ridley . The pun in the show's title is echoed by a coffee ring in its logo. On April 16, 2007 (Imus' show aired until April 11, 2007 on MSNBC), the show debuted as one of a series of rotating programs auditioning for Imus's former slot, with Scarborough joined by co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Ridley.

Feud with Donald Trump In an op-ed for The Washington Post in August 2016, Scarborough argued that the Republican Party must \"dump Donald Trump \" as their presidential candidate . Drawing attention to Trump's remarks about Hillary Clinton and the Second Amendment , Scarborough wrote: \"A bloody line has been crossed that cannot be ignored. At long last, Donald Trump has left the Republican Party few options but to act decisively and get this political train wreck off the tracks before something terrible happens.\" In June 2017, Scarborough and Brzezinski were the targets of",
