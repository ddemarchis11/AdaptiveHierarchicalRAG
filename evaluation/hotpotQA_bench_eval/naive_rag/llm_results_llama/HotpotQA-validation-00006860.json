I knew it was Taylor, and I've always loved her, but this is a totally other side – like, 'I want to know who brought that out in her.' I was unaware that I knew who Max Martin was. I Googled him, and I was like, 'He's literally written every massive soundtrack of my life.' So I got my management to reach out. They came to London, and I took my guitar along and was like, 'I've got this riff,' and then 'Send My Love' happened really quickly.\" Musical style Adele's music is primarily pop and soul , with elements of blues , \" classic R&B \", country , gospel , jazz , and Motown . Her early success came while several other British soul singers were present on the music scene, with the British press dubbing her a new Amy Winehouse. However, Adele called the comparisons between her and other female soul singers lazy, noting \"we're a gender, not a genre\". AllMusic wrote that \"Adele is simply too magical to compare her to anyone.\" Her song topics often address heartbreak and relationship. Adele's second album, 21 , shares the folk and soul influences of her debut album, but was further inspired by American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed",

Between 1985 and 1995, they recorded three major label albums as the Highwaymen: two on Columbia Records and one for Liberty Records . Their Columbia works produced three chart singles, including the number one \" Highwayman \" in 1985. One other vocal artist appeared on a Highwaymen recording: Johnny Rodriguez , who provided Spanish vocal on \" Deportee \", a Woody Guthrie composition, from the album Highwayman . The four starred together in the 1986 film Stagecoach . In 1990, the original members of the 1950s-'60s folk group of the same name sued the Highwaymen over their use of the name, which was inspired by a Jimmy Webb ballad the country stars had recorded. The suit was dropped when all parties agreed that the folk group owned the name but that the earlier group would grant a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to the supergroup to use the name. The two groups shared the stage at a 1990 concert in Hollywood. Albums Highwayman Formed in 1985, the group did not have an official name when they released their first two albums on Columbia Records . The first album, Highwayman , was credited to \"Nelson, Jennings, Cash, Kristofferson\". The single \" Highwayman \", a Jimmy Webb composition, became a #1 country hit.",

The album features a pair of duets with Waylon Jennings , one of which was the \"There Ain't No Good Chain Gang\" single; it was one of Cash's first collaborations with Jennings, and the two recorded songs together throughout the 1980s, including a separate album entitled Heroes . Cash and Jennings would also work together as the Highwaymen with Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson . Critical reception Rolling Stone noted that, \"in current country terminology, this outsider has become an Outlaw, and Cash, in keeping with the new secular faith, strips his sound to a lean roar, writes a few hard-boiled stories ripe with romantic agonies and enjoins Waylon Jennings, country music's Incredible Hulk, to glower along on a couple of songs.\" Track listing Personnel Johnny Cash - vocals, guitar Waylon Jennings - vocals and electric guitar on \"I Wish I Was Crazy Again\" and \"There Ain't No Good Chain Gang\" Bob Wootton , Jerry Hensley, Jack Routh, Jimmy Capps, Jerry Shook, Pete Wade - guitar Marshall Grant , Gordon Payne - bass WS Holland - drums Ralph Mooney - steel guitar Larry",
