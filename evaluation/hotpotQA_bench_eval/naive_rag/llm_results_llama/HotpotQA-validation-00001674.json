      "text": "Karel Jan Bossart (February 9, 1904 – August 3, 1975) was an innovative rocket designer and creator of the Atlas ICBM . His achievements rank alongside those of Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolev . But as most of his work was for the United States Air Force and was therefore classified, his achievements are not widely known. Biography Karel Bossart was born on February 9, 1904, in Antwerp , Belgium . He graduated in Mining Engineering at the Université libre de Bruxelles in 1924. After winning a scholarship to Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the Belgian American Educational Foundation to study aeronautical engineering, he remained in the United States, working for various aircraft companies. In 1945 he was chief of structures at Convair and proposed to the United States Air Force that a missile could be developed with a range of 8000 km. The Air Force was skeptical of Bossart's proposal, partly wishing to preserve the priority of strategic bombers, but granted him a limited contract to develop a prototype. Bossart's major innovation was the use of a monocoque design in which structural support was maintained by pressure within the inelastic fuel tanks. After a series of tests in 1947 the Air Force lost interest and Bossart was instructed to abandon the research, but by 1951 the escalation of the Cold War enabled Bossart to revive the project that became known as 'Atlas'.

The next year, the Air Force awarded him the Exceptional Civilian Award for his work in developing America's first ICBM. His co-workers called Bossart one of the finest technical men in the country. They credit him with having spearheaded a major phase in the art of rocketry. In 1965, Bossart was inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame for his pioneering contributions to the Atlas rocket system. He is featured in the Hall of Fame's exhibit within the San Diego Air and Space Museum . Bossart was later inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1990. Bossart died on August 3, 1975, in San Diego , California. References External links \"Karel Jan Bossart\" . Florida International University . Archived from the original on February 16, 2006 .

      "text": "the Soviet's first liquid-fueled rocket GIRD-X . Growing military interest in this new technology caused GIRD to be merged with the Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL) at Leningrad in 1933 to create the Reactive Scientific Research Institute (RNII), which brought together the best of the Soviet rocket talent, including Korolev, Georgy Langemak , and former GDL engine designer Valentin Glushko . Korolev was appointed deputy head under Ivan Kleymyonov , however in 1934, following a disagreement over the direction of RNII, Korolev was demoted to section chief of winged missiles and was replaced by Georgy Langemak . Korolev supervised development of cruise missiles and a crewed rocket-powered glider . \"Rocket Flight in Stratosphere\" was published by Korolev in 1934. On 10 April 1935, Korolev's wife gave birth to their daughter, Natalya; and they moved out of Sergei's parents' home and into their own apartment in 1936. Both Korolev and his wife had careers, and Sergei always spent long hours at his design office. Imprisonment Joseph Stalin 's Great Purge severely damaged RNII, with Director Kleymyonov and Chief Engineer Langemak arrested in November 1937, tortured, made to sign false confessions and executed in January 1938. Glushko was arrested in March",

      "text": "212 was Soviet experimental cruise missile developed in 1936 by Sergei Korolev . It was tested twice before being cancelled in 1939. The design was completed on August 2, 1936, and consisted of a rocket with wings which launched from a catapult . The catapult was tested twice in November, 1936, using a mock-up of the missile; both tests failed. It was then decided to use a Tupolev TB-3 aircraft as launch platform. The first test was done on May 27, 1938. Korolev was arrested one month later, but the project continued without him. On January 10, 1938, it was decided to no longer use Valentin Glushko 's ORM-65 [ ru ] rocket engine due to problems with the control system and some explosions. At that time the name of the missile was changed to 803 . During 1939 there were two more tests, failing again due to the control system. The project was finally abandoned.

He continued courses at Kiev until he was accepted into the Bauman Moscow State Technical University (MVTU, BMSTU) in July 1926, having the famous aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev as his mentor, who was a professor there. Korolev studied specialized aviation topics until 1929, while living with his family in the typically crowded conditions of Moscow. Korolev enjoyed opportunities to fly gliders and powered aircraft during this part of his education. He designed a glider in 1928, and flew it in a competition the next year. The Communist Party accelerated the education of engineers in 1929 to meet the country's urgent need for their skills. Korolev obtained a diploma by producing a practical aircraft design by the end of the year. Early career Korolev sitting in the cockpit of glider \"Koktebel.\" After graduation, Korolev worked with some of the best Soviet designers at the 4th Experimental Section aircraft design bureau OPO-4 headed by Paul Aimé Richard [ fr ] who emigrated to the USSR from France in the 1920s. He did not stand out in this group, but while so employed he also worked independently to design a glider capable of performing aerobatics. In 1930 he became interested in the possibilities of liquid-fueled rocket engines to propel airplanes, while working at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) as a lead engineer on",
