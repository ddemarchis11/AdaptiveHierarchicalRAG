Disagreements over money led several members to leave Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. Whitlock, recalling other difficulties with Delaney and Bonnie, noted the couple's frequent fights and described Delaney as a demanding band leader in the manner of James Brown . Gordon, Radle and other Friends personnel, including drummer Jim Keltner , immediately joined Joe Cocker 's Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour with Leon Russell , but Whitlock remained with Delaney and Bonnie for a short time. In April 1970, at the suggestion of his friend and mentor Steve Cropper , Whitlock travelled to England to visit Clapton. Whitlock subsequently lived in Hurtwood Edge, Clapton's house in Surrey , where the two musicians jammed and began to write the bulk of the Dominos' catalogue on acoustic guitars. Many of the new songs reflected Clapton's growing infatuation with Pattie Boyd , the wife of his best friend George Harrison , who had joined Clapton as a guitarist on Delaney & Bonnie's European tour in December 1969. I was in absolute awe of these people ... All we did was jam and jam and jam and night would become day and day would become night, and it just felt good to me to stay that way. I had never felt so musically free before. – Eric",

For three weeks from 1 August, the group performed in clubs and other small venues in Britain, where Clapton chose to play anonymously, still weary from the fame that he felt had plagued Cream and Blind Faith. Admission for the shows was set at £1, and clauses in the contract with each venue stipulated that Clapton's name was not to be used as a crowd-puller. Shapiro writes that the band had \"made great strides\" since the Lyceum concert; their set list included \"Tell the Truth\", covers of Billy Myles ' \" Have You Ever Loved a Woman \" and Jimi Hendrix 's \" Little Wing \", and songs such as \"Bottle of Red Wine\" and \"Don't Know Why\", both from the Eric Clapton album. Clapton has said of this UK tour, \"no one knew who we were, and I loved it. I loved the fact that we were this little quartet, playing in obscure places, sometimes to audiences of no more than fifty or sixty people.\" Layla sessions The band flew to Miami, Florida , on 23 August 1970 to begin recording with Atlantic Records producer Tom Dowd .

Based on material Pink Floyd composed while performing in Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded over numerous sessions throughout 1975 at EMI Studios in London. The lyrics express longing, alienation, and sardonic criticism of the music industry. The bulk of the album is taken up by \" Shine On You Crazy Diamond \", a nine-part tribute to Syd Barrett , a Pink Floyd co-founder who had left seven years earlier due to his deteriorating mental health; Barrett coincidentally visited the studio during recording. As with their previous release, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd employed studio effects and synthesisers . Guest singers included Roy Harper , who sang lead on \" Have a Cigar \", and Venetta Fields , who sang backing vocals on \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". To promote the album, Pink Floyd released the double A-side single \"Have a Cigar\" / \" Welcome to the Machine \". Wish You Were Here topped charts in several countries, including the UK Albums Chart and US Billboard 200 . It was certified gold in the UK and US in its year of release, and by 2004, it had sold an estimated 13 million copies worldwide. Upon release, it received mixed reviews",

All four members had previously played together in Delaney & Bonnie and Friends , during and after Clapton's brief tenure with Blind Faith . Dave Mason supplied additional lead guitar on early studio sessions and played at their first live gig. Another participant at their first session as a band was George Harrison , the recording for whose album All Things Must Pass marked the formation of Derek and the Dominos. Following the deaths of Radle in 1980, Gordon in 2023, and Whitlock in 2025, Clapton is the last surviving member of the band's official line-up. The band's only album release, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs , was produced by Tom Dowd , and also featured extensive contributions on lead and slide guitar from Duane Allman . A double album , Layla did not immediately enjoy strong sales or receive widespread radio airplay, but went on to earn critical acclaim. Although released in 1970 it was not until March 1972 that the album's single \" Layla \" (a tale of unrequited love inspired by Clapton's infatuation with his friend George Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd ) made the top ten in both the United States and the United",
