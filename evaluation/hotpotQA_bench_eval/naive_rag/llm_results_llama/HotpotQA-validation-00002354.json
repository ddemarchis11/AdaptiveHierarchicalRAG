      "text": "OU812 (pronounced \"Oh You Ate One Too\") is the eighth studio album by American rock band Van Halen . Released on May 24, 1988, it is the band's second album to feature vocalist Sammy Hagar . Van Halen began work on the album in September 1987 and completed it in April 1988, one month before its release. Like its predecessor 5150 , OU812 hit number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, the second of four consecutive #1 studio albums for the band. Spurred by four Billboard Hot 100 top-40 singles (\" Black and Blue \", #34; \" Finish What Ya Started \", #13; \" When It's Love \", #5; and \"Feels So Good\", #35), the album eventually sold over 4 million copies. The album was remastered by Donn Landee and released on October 6, 2023, as part of The Collection II ; the four studio albums with Hagar, plus an extra disc of eight rarities from this era. Production Once the 5150 tour concluded, Eddie Van Halen had some riffs he had been working on and Hagar \"had a bunch of lyrics in notebooks that I had been thinking about and writing\", so they decided to work on another album soon. While the album acknowledges Van Halen for writing and performing and Landee for recording, there was no production credit because according to Hagar, \"the band pretty",

      "text": "\" Finish What Ya Started \" is a song by Van Halen taken from their 1988 album OU812 . Background Despite the album being seemingly complete, Eddie Van Halen came up with the riff at 2 in the morning and went down to his then-neighbor Sammy Hagar to show it. Hagar let Eddie in, and the two played guitars in his balcony until they had a completed song. Once Eddie left, Hagar decided to write the lyrics despite being late at night. The theme wound up being sex without orgasm, summed up by Hagar as \" blue balls \". [ page needed ] In the song, Eddie recorded his guitar part on a Fender Stratocaster plugged direct into the studio mixing console. The song is one of only two Van Halen tracks featuring Hagar playing a rhythm guitar part, which he played on a Gibson acoustic.  The version of the song on their 2004 compilation The Best of Both Worlds has no fade out unlike the album version. Music video The official music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan . It features the band playing against a plain white background with quick cuts to women dancing. Charts Reception Cash Box called it \"a remarkable single...that owes more to T-Rex and Creedence than to a Whitesnake .\" In 1988, the song peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #2 on the Billboard rock chart. In popular culture The song was later used as theme music for the",

But \"Mine All Mine\" is a good teaser for the future, the slow stuff is classy radio fare, and at its best, OU812 is a veritable feast of great white rock & roll wow.\" Xavier Russell of Kerrang! was more enthusiastic and called OU812 \"loud, rude, dirty and very much a Van Halen album\". A retrospective review from AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was fairly positive. Erlewine stated that \"when David Lee Roth fronted the band, almost everything that Van Halen did seemed easy – as big, boisterous, and raucous as an actual party – but Van Hagar makes good times seem like tough work here.\" Still, he stated that \"the riffs are complicated, not catchy, the rhythms plod, they don't rock, and Sammy strains to inject some good times by singing too hard.\" However, he concluded that \"if it isn't as good as Fair Warning (even if it's nearly not as much fun), it's nevertheless the best showcase of the instrumental abilities of Van Hagar.\" Canadian journalist Martin",

      "text": "album acknowledges Van Halen for writing and performing and Landee for recording, there was no production credit because according to Hagar, \"the band pretty much produced the album ourselves. And we weren't producers, in the sense that we went in with an idea and told everybody what to do and took control. There just wasn't a producer.\" The only cover song on the album, Little Feat 's \"A Apolitical Blues\", was coincidentally also done by former Van Halen producer Ted Templeman and Landee, to the point the engineer used the same setup to record Van Halen's version. When Hagar was brought to the studio, Eddie showed a piano and drums demo he recorded with Alex Van Halen , which the band soon developed into the song \" When It's Love \". Given the musical parts were finished quicker than the lyrics, Hagar took some weeks off and travelled to his Mexican house at Cabo San Lucas to work on more songs. There he found the inspiration for the song \"Cabo Wabo\", which borrowed the melody of \"Make It Last\", a song Hagar composed for his previous band Montrose , and whose title later named Hagar's nightclub in the city . The last song to be developed was \" Finish What Ya Started \", which Eddie and Hagar composed one night late into the production. However, the last track to which Hagar recorded his vocals was the eventual album opener \"Mine All Mine\", as he felt unsure about the",

      "text": "The OU812 Tour was a concert tour by the American hard rock band Van Halen in support of their studio album OU812 . Background Van Halen began their tour with a United States leg known as the \"Monsters of Rock\" tour through 23 cities alongside Metallica, Scorpions, Dokken and Kingdom Come which would feature a specially constructed stage with lights and state-of-the-art sound equipment. The tour originated when promoter Louis Messina had approached the band and suggested a five-band summer long tour, up to which the band didn't hesitate to sign. In the end, the leg itself was a financial failure, though it would be their most expensive tour. Some of the cities the band performed in during the \"Monsters of Rock\" tour had however shown some success while there was confusion from the promoters where the tour didn't do well, bringing up speculation that the album wasn't familiar with the audience yet, while others stated that the shows were on a weekday while school was going on. During the show in East Troy, Hagar fell during the opening song on the set, receiving a minor tailbone fracture. Despite his injury, he did finish the performance. Following the Monsters of Rock tour, the band did go on a brief hiatus before continuing the tour. On the second North American leg, Van Halen performed in smaller venues, wrapping up the tour with shows in Japan and Hawaii.

But Sammy . . . like wow. If I can't claim the new boy owns them [...], you can't deny he defines them.\" Rolling Stone ' s David Fricke rated the album three-and-a-half out of five stars. He said of \"Source of Infection\": \"While Eddie Van Halen sprays you with a machine-gun succession of speed-metal-guitar arpeggios, Sammy Hagar sends out the party invitations with his usual savoir-faire — \"Hey! All right! Whoo!\" Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony, of course, take him at his word, shooting into hyper-beat space before you can say, 'Jump'.\" He noted that \"Van Halen, contrary to purist grumbling, did not wimp out when Diamond Dave hit the bricks. Nor did the band go — ugh! — pop: the 5150 ladies' choice \" Why Can't This Be Love \" wasn't really a ballad; it was more like Big Rock Melancholia. In fact, all the 5150 -model Van Halen did was replace one mighty mouth with another and trot out some hip, new songwriting tricks.\" Still, he stated that \"the curve balls [...] don't always hit the strike zone.",
