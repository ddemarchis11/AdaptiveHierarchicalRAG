      "text": "Management consulting is the practice of providing consulting services to organizations to improve their performance or in any way to assist in achieving organizational objectives . Organizations may draw upon the services of management consultants for a number of reasons, including gaining external (and presumably objective) advice and accessing consultants' specialized expertise regarding concerns that call for additional oversight. As a result of their exposure to and relationships with numerous organizations, consulting firms are typically aware of industry \" best practices \". However, the specific nature of situations under consideration may limit the ability or appropriateness of transferring such practices from one organization to another. Management consulting is an additional service to internal management functions and, for various legal and practical reasons, may not be seen as a replacement for internal management. Unlike interim management , management consultants do not become part of the organization to which they provide services. Consultancies provide services such as: organizational change management assistance, development of coaching skills, process analysis , technology implementation, strategy development, or operational improvement services. Management consultants often bring their own proprietary methodologies or frameworks to guide the identification of problems and to serve as the basis for recommendations with a view to more effective or efficient ways of performing work tasks. The economic function of management consulting firms is in general to help and facilitate the development , rationalization and optimization of the various markets pertaining to the geographic areas and jurisdictions in which they operate . However, the exact nature of the value of such a service model may vary greatly across markets and its description is therefore contingent . History Management consulting grew with",

In more recent times, traditional management consulting firms have had to face increasing challenges from disruptive online marketplaces that are aiming to cater to the increasing number of freelance management consulting professionals. Function The functions of consulting services are commonly broken down into eight task categories. Consultants can function as bridges for information and knowledge, and external consultants can provide these bridging services more economically than client firms themselves. Consultants can be engaged proactively, without significant external enforcement, and reactively, with external pressure. Proactive consultant engagement is engaged mainly with aim to find hidden weak spots and improve performance, while the reactive consultant engagement is mostly aimed at solving problems identified by external stakeholders. Marvin Bower , McKinsey's long-term director, has mentioned the benefits of a consultant's externality, that they have varied experience outside the client company. Management consulting could be classified into two categories:  General management consulting, which concerns strategy , corporate finance , organization , environmental social and corporate governance , risk and compliance , and so forth. It entails questions that are relevant to the entirety of the client organization as a whole, on a management level.  Specialized management consulting, which concerns questions that are specific to a certain function or subset of the client organization, such as legal management consulting, financial management consulting , digital management consulting , technology management consulting, operations management consulting, and Executive search .  Management consulting often involves a mix of both of these categories.",

      "text": "Adizes and coauthors also criticize the timing of consultant services. Client organizations, which are usually lacking the knowledge they want to obtain from the consultant, cannot correctly estimate the right timing for an engagement of consultants. Consultants are usually engaged too late when problems become visible to the top of the client's organizational pyramid. A proactive checkup, like a regular medical checkup, is recommended. On the other side, this opens additional danger for abuse from disreputable practitioners. International standards ISO published the international standard ISO 20700 Guidelines for Management Consultancy Services on June 1, 2017, replacing EN 16114 . This document represents the first international standard for the management consultancy industry.
