      "text": "The Legend of the Titanic ( Spanish : La leyenda del Titanic , Italian : La leggenda del Titanic ) is a 1999 internationally co-produced animated fantasy film directed by Orlando Corradi and Kim J. Ok. The film is based on the sinking of the RMS Titanic , incorporating fantasy elements such as anthropomorphic animals and magical spells. In an attempt to advertise the story as more child-friendly, the film's writers decided to change the historical account so that no character (including the captain, crew, and passengers) would die, a decision that was met with controversy. The Legend of the Titanic was followed by a 2004 sequel titled Tentacolino and a 2011 television series, Fantasy Island (not to be confused with the popular 1977–1984 fantasy drama of the same name ). Plot In New York City, an old mouse named Connors tells his grandchildren the supposedly \"true\" story of the RMS Titanic , after discouraging one of his grandchildren from playing with a shark whistle, telling him it will attract Mr. Ice . In April 1912, Connors was a young sailor mouse on the Titanic ' s maiden voyage from Southampton to New York . He also befriends a young Brazilian mouse named Ronny, who enjoys playing soccer, and falls in love with his sister Stella. Meanwhile, a rich aristocratic woman named Elizabeth, her family, and a young Romani-Spanish man named Don Juan board the Titanic, which immediately sets off.",

The film starred Helen Hayes , who won an Academy Award for her performance. Additionally, Selwyn wrote two screenplays and many more films were adapted from his original plays. He died in Los Angeles, California . Titanic sailing In April 1912 Selwyn and his wife, playwright Margaret Mayo , held tickets to New York on the RMS Titanic but did not make the trip as he had a prior engagement to hear the reading of a new play in Paris . They had had plans to accompany Broadway producer Henry B. Harris and his wife Renee with whom they had been touring Europe and Algiers . Selwyn's commitment to hearing the play, while others tried to goad him to board the ship, more than likely saved his life. His second wife was actress Ruth Selwyn , a sister of director Fred M. Wilcox and sister-in-law of Nicholas Schenck .

As some alien ecosystems are likely to be a lot harsher than a typical terrestrial ecosystem, these exotic vents provide an insight into some of the forms that alien life might take. The documentary shows Cameron's passion for exploring the oceans, as well as his interest in extraterrestrial life. It also showcases the technology employed to reach such depths. The film is similar to Cameron's earlier documentary, Ghosts of the Abyss (2003), which involves him journeying to the wreck of the RMS Titanic . It too was filmed in the 3-D IMAX format.
