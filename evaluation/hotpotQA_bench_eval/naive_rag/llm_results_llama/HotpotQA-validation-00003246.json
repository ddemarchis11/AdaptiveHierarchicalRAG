      "text": "Imperial War Museum North (sometimes referred to as IWM North ) is a museum in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester , England. One of five branches of the Imperial War Museum , it explores the impact of modern conflicts on people and society. It is the first branch of the Imperial War Museum to be located in the north of England. The museum occupies a site overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal on Trafford Wharf Road, Trafford Park , an area which during World War II was a key industrial centre and consequently heavily bombed during the Manchester Blitz in 1940. The area is now home to the Lowry cultural centre and the MediaCityUK development, which stand opposite the museum at Salford Quays . The museum building was designed by architect Daniel Libeskind and opened in July 2002, receiving 470,000 visitors in its first year of opening. It was recognised with awards or prize nominations for its architecture and is a prime example of Deconstructivist architecture. The museum features a permanent exhibition of chronological and thematic displays, supported by hourly audiovisual presentations which are projected throughout the gallery space. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions in a separate gallery. Since opening, the museum has operated a successful volunteer programme, which since January 2007 has been run in partnership with Manchester Museum . As part of a national museum, Imperial War Museum North is financed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and by self-generated income. Admission is free. Planning and construction",

At the same time the Greater Manchester Integrated Transport Authority (GMITA) was abolished, with responsibility for oversight of the executive transferred to the combined authority. The combined authority and the ten Greater Manchester districts have delegated or referred most of their transport governance functions to a joint committee, the Bee Network Committee. Each local authority appoints one of its executive members with responsibility for transport matters to sit alongside the mayor, a member of the GMCA, and up to four other councillors appointed by the mayor. These additional mayoral appointees allow the committee's political make-up to reflect the political make-up of Greater Manchester's councils as a whole. The Bee Network Committee has four key responsibilities: Decision-making over significant operational matters across the transport network (including the ability to draw down funding for investment), monitoring the performance and financial stability of the network, developing policy to support the local transport plan, and facilitating coordination between the ten local authorities around highways maintenance and infrastructure delivery.

It operates as a deep-level subway in Downtown Pittsburgh , but runs mostly at-grade in the suburbs south of the city. The system is largely linear in a north–south direction, with one terminus near Pittsburgh's central business district and two termini in the South Hills . The system is owned and operated by Pittsburgh Regional Transit . The T is one of the surviving first-generation streetcar systems in North America , with the oldest portions of the network dating back to 1903 and the Pittsburgh Railways . It is also one of only three light rail systems in the United States that continues to use the broad 5 ft 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1,588 mm ) Pennsylvania trolley gauge on its lines instead of the 4 ft 8 + 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard gauge . In 2024, the system had a ridership of 3,236,100.
