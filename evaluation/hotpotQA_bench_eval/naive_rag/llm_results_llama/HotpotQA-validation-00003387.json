      "text": "247 Cherry is a 79-story residential building under development on the Lower East Side of Manhattan , New York City . The building was designed by SHoP Architects , and is being developed by JDS Development Group . Renderings for the building were first released in April 2016. The building will be adjacent to One Manhattan Square . 247 Cherry will be developed in conjunction with two other nearby skyscrapers: 269 South Street and 259 Clinton Street. Development of the building was halted in July 2016 due to a lawsuit pertaining to a site adjacent the structure. In July 2018, the developers released a new plan that would also contain several improvements to the surrounding area, including a new entrance to the New York City Subway 's East Broadway station, connections between Clinton Street and the East River , renovations of nearby playgrounds, and flood-resistance upgrades. The city's Planning Commission also scheduled a vote on the project. Although politicians and grassroots organizations opposed the project, the City Planning Commission approved it in December 2018. The developments were temporarily blocked by a New York Supreme Court judge in late February 2020, but then unblocked by a full New York Supreme Court panel of judges in August 2020, and their decision in favor of the development was then upheld by the New York Court of Appeals in April 2021.

The loan allowed GM, which then had a low supply of cash, to increase its current assets while also deferring payment of the city's capital gains tax . The mortgages were significantly below market rates. Even so, some tenants signed leases of over $50 per square foot ($540/m 2 ) during this time. Among the new office tenants in the 1980s were Sanford C. Bernstein and Company . After GM's relocation, the 13th floor was renamed floor 12A at the request of Estee Lauder, a change that confused many building visitors. By the late 1980s, the General Motors Building, along with the Solow Building and the Seagram Building , charged some of the city's highest rents. In spite of the fact that architects considered neither the General Motors Building nor the Solow Building to be architecturally distinguished, their proximity to Central Park allowed their respective owners to charge high rents. In 1986, FAO Schwarz moved its flagship toy store to the General Motors Building's ground-floor retail space. CPI started a three-year, $7.5 million renovation in 1990, re- caulking the windows and replacing about 400 of the 43,000 exterior marble slabs. The following year, CPI exercised its option to buy the building from General Motors for $500 million. By 1995, GM was close to shuttering its New York City outpost and moving to",

By the 1950s, almost all of the 19th-century structures on Grand Army Plaza had been either destroyed or renovated. Architecture The General Motors Building was designed by Edward Durell Stone and the firm Emery Roth & Sons . It is 50 stories tall with a roof of 705 feet (215 m). The building also has two basement levels. The stories are connected by 35 elevators. Facade The facade is made of vertical piers of white Georgia marble, alternating with strips of glass. According to Stone, he used white marble because many of the surrounding buildings had similar cladding on their lower stories. Stone believed that \"those black buildings that have been modish in the past look perfectly horrible\". The load-bearing marble piers are rhomboid in shape and contain a 7 ⁄ 8 -inch (22 mm) thick cladding, behind which are hollow concrete columns with service ducts. At the ground and second stories, the General Motors Building was originally clad with thirty large windows, measuring 30 feet (9.1 m) tall and 0.875 inches (22.2 mm) thick. Ten of these panels, weighing 3,080 pounds (1,400 kg) and measuring 9 feet (2.7 m) wide, were the largest single windows ever made for a building at the time of their",

By January 1967, all of the space in the building had been leased. Morgan Guaranty took ground-story space on the Madison Avenue side for a bank branch. Other initial office tenants included Bowater Paper Company , advertising firm Leo Burnett Company , advertising firm Leber Katz Paccione, shipping line Moore-McCormack , and stock brokerage Reynolds & Co. In addition, cosmetics manufacturers Estee Lauder, Revlon, and Helena Rubinstein Inc., as well as advertising firm Wells, Rich, Greene , took space in the building. Unlike at other structures, Savoy Fifth Avenue Corp did not offer to assume prospective occupants' leases. Because of the large concentration of perfume and cosmetics firms, the building was also initially nicknamed the \"General Odors Building\".
