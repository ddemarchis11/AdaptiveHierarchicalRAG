Founded as the Imperial War Museum in 1917, it was intended to record the civil and military war effort and sacrifice of the United Kingdom and its Empire during the First World War . The museum's remit has since expanded to include all conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914. As of 2012, the museum aims \"to provide for, and to encourage, the study and understanding of the history of modern war and 'wartime experience'.\" Originally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill , the museum opened to the public in 1920. In 1924, it moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington and in 1936 it acquired a permanent home at the former Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark , which serves as its headquarters. The outbreak of the Second World War saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference, but in the post-war period it entered a period of decline. In 1976 the museum opened IWM Duxford at Duxford airfield in Cambridgeshire , and in 1978 the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Belfast , which is permanently berthed on the River Thames in central London, became a branch of the museum.

Title sequence In the series title sequence a rostrum camera created a montage of three images. The first shows a British soldier, in silhouette, standing over the grave of a comrade, the camera initially focusing on the grave's cross, where the words IN MEMORY are glimpsed. The second image shows a uniformed, skeletal corpse by the entrance to a dugout. The final image shows a lone Irish soldier, looking directly into the camera, apparently surrounded by corpses; this is a montage of several images combined for dramatic effect. The original image of the staring soldier, showing him surrounded by fellow soldiers rather than corpses, was taken from photograph Q 1 in the Imperial War Museum photograph archive but has been described as having quickly become symbolic of the First World War. This title sequence was set against the series theme music, composed by Wilfred Josephs and performed by the BBC Northern Orchestra .
