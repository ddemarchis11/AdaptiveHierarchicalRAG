The show originally ran from 7 September 1977 to 20 November 1995 and was hosted by Gordon Burns . Contestants across the United Kingdom and Ireland competed in rounds that tested their physical stamina and mental attributes. The show's title refers to Superman 's home planet, Krypton , the title perceiving that the contestants had strong superhuman \"powers\" for participating in the challenges they were set. From 1986 onwards, the contestants all had their corresponding colours: red , green , yellow , or blue . The points contestants earned through the game were referred to as their \"Krypton Factor\", e.g. \"The winner, with a Krypton Factor of 46, is the technical specialist from Birmingham , Caroline White\". The 1987 series won the prestigious Premios Ondas – Spanish Television Award for Entertainment. The show was revived for two series aired in 2009 and 2010, presented by Ben Shephard .

The two did not get along and had an acrimonious relationship on and off the air. The agreement gave Carson's production company ownership of the timeslot following Tonight , which Carson Productions and NBC used to create Late Night with David Letterman on February 1, 1982. When NBC offered Snyder the time slot after Letterman, he refused it, having always been resentful of the forced change in format, and NBC News Overnight , a newscast, took the slot instead, some months after Tomorrow's final broadcast in 1982. During his tenure as host of The Tonight Show , Carson became known as The King of Late Night . While numerous hosts ( Merv Griffin and Dick Cavett being the best-known) attempted to compete with Carson, none was ever successful in drawing more viewers than Carson did on Tonight , not even ABC's short-lived revival of Paar's show in 1973 using the name Jack Paar Tonite (though Paar blamed erratic scheduling and his own unwillingness to succeed at the expense of Cavett, his friend and former writer). Much like Paar, Carson became tired of fulfilling the workload of 525 minutes a week, so The Tonight Show was shortened to 90 minutes and again to 60 minutes in 1980 with 15 weeks of vacation a year.

Kate Scott became the announcer for Seahawks TV preseason games in 2023, replacing Curt Menefee (the host of Fox NFL Sunday ) who had been the Seahawks TV voice since the 2009 preseason. KCPQ-TV , which airs most of the Seahawks' regular-season games (as the Seattle-Tacoma area's Fox affiliate), became the television partner for the team in 2012 and replaced KING-TV as broadcaster for preseason games, but KING-TV regained the partnership in 2022; simulcasts of any Seahawks games on ESPN 's Monday Night Football air (as of the 2018 season) on CBS affiliate KIRO-TV .
