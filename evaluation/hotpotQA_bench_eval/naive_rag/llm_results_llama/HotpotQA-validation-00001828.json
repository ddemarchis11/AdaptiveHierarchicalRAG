By April of that year, he took charge of British intelligence operations in North America . In 1780, André briefly took part in Clinton's invasion of the American South , which began with the successful siege of Charleston .  Around this time, André took over control of British communication with Continental Army officer Benedict Arnold . Arnold was a popular general officer who had been wounded twice in battle, and was considered an American hero for his actions at the Battles of Saratoga . However, he had become bitter about the decline in his financial fortunes caused by the war, and the reluctance of the Continental Congress to grant him the promotions Arnold believed he deserved. Arnold's Loyalist wife, Peggy Shippen , was one of the go-betweens in his correspondence with André. Arnold steadily provided the British with vital intelligence on American military movements and General George Washington 's strategies. His ultimate goal was to be the key player in helping the British achieve a decisive blow against American forces for which he would be handsomely rewarded. In pursuit of this plan, Arnold carefully maneuvered his way into the command of critical Continental Army fortifications at West Point, New York , secretly promising to surrender them to the British for £20,000 (approximately £3.62 million in",

      "text": "The Siege of Yorktown , also known as the Battle of Yorktown and the surrender at Yorktown , was the final major land engagement of the American Revolutionary War . It was won decisively by the Continental Army , led by George Washington , with support from the Marquis de Lafayette and French Army troops , led by the Comte de Rochambeau , and a French Navy force commanded by the Comte de Grasse , defeating the British Army commanded by British Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis . The French and American armies united north of New York City during the summer of 1781. Following the arrival of dispatches from France that included the possibility of support from the French West Indies fleet of the Comte de Grasse , disagreements arose between Washington and Rochambeau on whether to ask de Grasse for assistance in besieging New York or in military operations against a British army in Virginia. On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay , where Cornwallis had taken command of the British army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer, Henry Clinton , was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep-water port, which he began to do at Yorktown. Cornwallis's movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette . When word of de Grasse's decision to engage the British navy at the Chesapeake Bay arrived in New",

However, Washington firmly refused to grant the British the honors that they had denied the defeated American army the year before at the siege of Charleston . Consequently, the British and Hessian troops marched with flags furled and muskets shouldered, while the band was forced to play \"a British or German march.\" American history books recount the legend that the British band played \" The World Turn'd Upside Down \", but the story may be apocryphal.

At Yorktown, VA, Oct. 1781, a painting by Nathaniel Currier , now housed at the D'Amour Museum of Fine Arts Cornwallis refused to attend the surrender ceremony, claiming that he had an illness. Instead, Brigadier General Charles O'Hara led the British army onto the field. O'Hara first attempted to surrender to Rochambeau, who shook his head and pointed to Washington. O'Hara then offered his sword to Washington, who also refused and motioned to Major General Benjamin Lincoln , his second-in-command. The surrender finally took place when Lincoln accepted the sword of Cornwallis's deputy. The British soldiers marched out and laid down their arms in between the French and American armies, while many civilians watched. At this time, the troops on the other side of the river in Gloucester also surrendered. The British soldiers had been issued new uniforms hours before the surrender and until prevented by General O'Hara some",

AD 1781, when the British, under the command of the Traitor Benedict Arnold , burnt the towns of New London and Groton and spread desolation and woe throughout the region. Benedict Arnold (January 14, 1741 [ O.S. January 3, 1740] – June 14, 1801) was an American-born British military officer who served during the American Revolutionary War . He fought with distinction for the American Continental Army and rose to the rank of major general before defecting to the British in 1780. General George Washington had given him his fullest trust and had placed him in command of West Point in New York . Arnold was planning to surrender the fort to British forces, but the plot was discovered in September 1780, whereupon he fled to the British lines. In the later part of the war, Arnold was commissioned as a brigadier general in the British Army and placed in command of the American Legion . He led British forces in battle against the army which he had once commanded, and his name became synonymous with treason and",

      "text": "Major John André (May 2, 1750 – October 2, 1780) was a British Army officer who served as the head of Britain's intelligence operations during the American War for Independence . In September 1780, André negotiated with Continental Army general Benedict Arnold , who secretly offered to turn over control of the American fort at West Point, New York to the British. Due to a series of mishaps and unforeseen events, André was forced to try to return to British lines from a meeting with Arnold through American-controlled territory while wearing civilian clothes. André was captured by three American militiamen and was quickly identified and imprisoned. He was subsequently convicted of espionage by the Continental Army and executed by hanging on George Washington 's orders. His execution led to an outburst of anti-American sentiment in Great Britain, and American painter John Trumbull was imprisoned as a result. André is typically remembered positively by historians, and several prominent leaders of the Patriot cause , including Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette , disagreed with the decision to execute him. Early life André was born on May 2, 1750, in London , England, to wealthy Huguenot parents who had immigrated there from Continental Europe . His parents were Antoine André, a merchant from Geneva , and Marie Louise Girardot, who had been born in Paris .
