It served as the headquarters of the Shanghai branch of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation from 1923 to 1955, and currently houses the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD Bank). The building is situated at number 12, the Bund. Designed by the British architecture firm Palmer & Turner architects and surveyors, construction of the building lasted from 5 May 1921 to 23 June 1923. Layout The HSBC Building has been called \"the most luxurious building from the Suez Canal to the Bering Strait\". The building has a floor area of 23,415 square metres (252,040 sq ft), and was, at the time, the largest bank building in the Far East , and second largest in the world, after the Bank of Scotland building in Edinburgh . The building exterior adopted a strict neo-classicist design, with a tripartite vertical and horizontal division. In the centre is a dome, the base decorated with a triangular structure in imitation of Greek temples. Below that are six Ionic columns penetrating from the second to the fourth storey.

These lions were the inspiration for a second and much larger pair to a completely new design by Shanghai-based British sculptor W W Wagstaff that were commissioned for the bank's new Headquarters in Hong Kong , opened in 1935. This second pair of lions was cast in Shanghai. [ page needed ] During the wartime occupation of Shanghai, the lions were removed by the Japanese to be melted down for their valuable bronze, but they escaped this fate and were restored after the end of the war. They were removed once again in 1966, during the Cultural Revolution . The Shanghai Artefact Administration Board stored the lions in the warehouse of the Shanghai Comedy Troupe. In 1980, they were handed over to the Shanghai Museum where they are on display today. In 1997, when the SPD Bank moved into the building, replicas were made and placed in front of the building. The Bund Financial Square features a bull statue (installed 2010) by sculptor Arturo Di Modica who also did the Wall Street Charging Bull in New York (from 1989).

It is located on the southern side of Statue Square near the location of the old City Hall , Hong Kong (built in 1869, demolished in 1933). The previous HSBC building was built in 1935 and pulled down to make way for the current building. The address remains as 1 Queen's Road Central (the north facing side of the building was served by Des Voeux Road Central , which was the seashore, making Queen's Road the main entrance, in contrast to the current primary access coming from Des Voeux Road). History First building The first HSBC (then known as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Company Limited) building was Wardley House, used as an HSBC office between 1865 and 1882 on the present site. In 1864 the lease cost HKD 500 a month. After raising a capital of HKD 5 million, the bank opened its doors in 1865. Second building Wardley House was subsequently demolished and replaced by a second HSBC building that was completed in 1886. The main feature of the second building design was the division of the structure into two almost separate buildings. The building on Queen's Road Central was in Victorian style with a verandah, colonnades and an octagonal dome , whereas an arcade which",

Other HSBC branches often feature guardian lions to different designs, such as Chinese guardian lions . Lighting scheme The HSBC Main Building at night In 2003, the Hong Kong Tourism Board developed a harbour lighting plan called \" A Symphony of Lights \", a large-scale multimedia show featuring lighting, laser, music, and occasionally special pyrotechnics effects during festivals, to promote tourism in Hong Kong. The show was based on the illumination of key buildings on the Hong Kong Island side, and was best viewed from the Kowloon side across the Victoria Harbour . The HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building was one of the participating buildings in the show.

Specimens are known from the Agra and Masterman's Bank and the Asiatic Banking Corporation that existed between 1862–66 and from The National Bank of China in the 1890s. There was a continuous issue till the Second World War in different colours and dimensions, and this issue was resumed after the war in 1946, by the HSBC, Mercantile and Standard Chartered Banks. This was somewhat standardised in 1970 when the Chartered Bank changed the issue from brown to red, red was the colour of the other two issues. The Mercantile bank stopped issuing banknotes after 1974 and the Bank of China issued their version in 1994. The colour was made uniform when red for all banknotes was adopted.

      "text": "The HSBC building has a wide open area (the Statue Square) in front of it, with no other buildings blocking its view of Victoria Harbour ; thus, it is considered to have \"good feng shui\". In the CBC Television series Doc Zone episode \"Superstitious Minds\", Writer, Researcher & Associate Producer Tom Puchniak asserts that the design of the nearby Bank of China Tower ignored feng shui principles, and created instant controversy by evoking two knife edges, one pointing towards the British Government House , another towards the HSBC building. After the Bank of China building opened, a series of mishaps occurred, including the death of the Governor, and a downturn in the city's economy. It is alleged that HSBC installed two maintenance cranes on the roof, pointing directly at the Bank of China, to defend against the negative energy from the Bank of China building. According to feng shui master Paul Hung, this solved the problem, and HSBC experienced \"no harmful results after that.\" But when the HSBC building was designed in the late 1970s and completed in 1985, the rooftop \"cannons\"—actually maintenance cranes—were already part of the original architectural plan. The Bank of China Tower was not completed until 1990. So the claim that HSBC added the cranes to counteract negative feng shui energy from the BOC building is simply false. It is a myth that has been repeated",
