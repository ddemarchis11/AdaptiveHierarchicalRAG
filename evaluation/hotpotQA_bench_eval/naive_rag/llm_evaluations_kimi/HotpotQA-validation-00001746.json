    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not name any 16th-century British card game similar to Crash in terms of no betting. However, the context explicitly mentions Brag as a game without betting, which aligns with the Gold Answer. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and is not faithful to the retrieved context."
