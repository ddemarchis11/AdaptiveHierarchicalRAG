  "question": "What is the birthday of the man who played Lex Luthor in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace?",
  "gold_answer": "January 30, 1930",
  "llm_answer": "The provided evidence does not include Gene Hackman's birthday.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not contain Gene Hackman's birthday, which is accurate. However, it fails to answer the user's question using external knowledge, which is expected in this scenario. The Gold Answer provides the birthday (January 30, 1930), but the Model Answer does not include this information, resulting in a score of 0.0 for correctness and evidence coverage."
