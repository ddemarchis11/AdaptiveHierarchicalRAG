  "question": "Are Staten Island Catapult and This Is Elvis both documentaries?",
  "gold_answer": "yes",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, only *This Is Elvis* is explicitly described as a documentary. The evidence does not mention *Staten Island Catapult* at all, so its classification as a documentary cannot be confirmed.  \n\n**Answer:** Only *This Is Elvis* is confirmed to be a documentary.",

    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that both Staten Island Catapult and This Is Elvis are documentaries, but the Model Answer incorrectly claims that only This Is Elvis is confirmed as a documentary. While the context does not provide information about Staten Island Catapult, the Model Answer fails to align with the Gold Answer's assertion. The Model Answer is faithful to the context but does not cover the key fact that both are documentaries."
