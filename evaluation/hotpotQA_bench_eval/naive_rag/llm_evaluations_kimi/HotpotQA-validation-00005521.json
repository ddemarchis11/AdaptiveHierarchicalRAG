  "question": "What is the central institution of Cheyenne Indian tribal governance that Ehyophsta was not a member of?",
  "gold_answer": "the Council of Forty-four",
  "llm_answer": "The central institutions of traditional Cheyenne tribal governance are the Cheyenne military societies and the Council of Forty-four. Ehyophsta was a member of a society of women who had gone to war, but the evidence does not state that she was a member of either the Council of Forty-four or any of the named military societies. Therefore, the central institution she was not a member of is the Council of Forty-four.",
