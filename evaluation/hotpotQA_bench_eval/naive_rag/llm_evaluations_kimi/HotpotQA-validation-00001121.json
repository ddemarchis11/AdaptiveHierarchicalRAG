    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly addresses Louisa Adams instead of Melania Trump, who is the second First Lady born outside the United States. The Gold Answer specifies 'fashion model,' which is supported by the Retrieved Context describing Melania Trump's career before marriage. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and is not grounded in the context."
