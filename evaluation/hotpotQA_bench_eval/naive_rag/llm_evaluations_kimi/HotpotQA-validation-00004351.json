    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the evidence does not specify the number of pages, which is accurate based on the retrieved context. However, it fails to provide the correct answer of 128 pages as stated in the Gold Answer. While the response is faithful to the context, it does not address the user's question correctly or include the key fact from the Gold Answer."
