  "question": "How many women in total competed at the Asian Games the year Lee Young-Sun achieved her personal best throw of 58.87 metres?",
  "gold_answer": "179 women",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about the total number of women who competed at the 2002 Asian Games. However, it fails to answer the question, which has a known Gold Answer of 179 women. The retrieved context does not contradict the Model Answer, but it does not support the Gold Answer either."
