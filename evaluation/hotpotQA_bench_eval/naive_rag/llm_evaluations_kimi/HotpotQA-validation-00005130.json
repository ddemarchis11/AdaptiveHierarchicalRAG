  "question": "Which is farther west, Sheridan County, Montana or Chandra Taal?",
  "gold_answer": "Sheridan County",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence provides the coordinates for Sheridan County, Montana (48°44′N 104°30′W) but does not give any coordinates for Chandra Taal. Without the longitude of Chandra Taal, it is impossible to determine which location is farther west.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Gold Answer clearly states that Sheridan County is farther west, but the Model Answer fails to provide this conclusion and instead claims that the determination is impossible due to missing coordinates for Chandra Taal. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not align with the Gold Answer or cover the key fact that Sheridan County is farther west."
