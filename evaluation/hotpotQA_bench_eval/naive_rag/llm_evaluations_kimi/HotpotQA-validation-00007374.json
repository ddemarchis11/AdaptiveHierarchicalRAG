  "question": "What type of diet does the author of Eat to Live: The Amazing Nutrient-Rich Program for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss advocate?",
  "gold_answer": "micronutrient-rich",
  "llm_answer": "The author advocates a diet that is vegetarian, vegan, low-salt, low-fat, and gluten-free for the first six weeks, after which animal products may be added.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly describes the dietary restrictions advocated in the book, such as vegetarian, vegan, low-salt, low-fat, and gluten-free aspects, which are supported by the context. However, it does not explicitly mention the 'micronutrient-rich' aspect, which is the core of the Gold Answer. While the details provided are accurate and grounded in the context, the omission of the key term 'micronutrient-rich' reduces evidence coverage and correctness."
