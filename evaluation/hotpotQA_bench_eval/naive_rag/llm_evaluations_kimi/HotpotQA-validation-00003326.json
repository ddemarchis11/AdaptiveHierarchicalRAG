  "gold_answer": "Martin Scorsese",

    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not specify the director of the biographical film in which Leonard Logsdail had a cameo role. The context clearly mentions Martin Scorsese as one of the directors Logsdail worked with and identifies 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' directed by Scorsese, as a film in which Logsdail had a cameo. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and does not align with the retrieved context."
