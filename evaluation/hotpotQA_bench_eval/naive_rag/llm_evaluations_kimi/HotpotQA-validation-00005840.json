    "explanation": "The Model Answer 'The Boys' is incorrect as it does not align with the Gold Answer 'the Vertigo series Preacher.' Additionally, the retrieved context does not support the claim that 'The Boys' was written by the writer of Crossed. The correct answer is not mentioned in the context, and the model's response is both unfaithful and lacks evidence coverage."
