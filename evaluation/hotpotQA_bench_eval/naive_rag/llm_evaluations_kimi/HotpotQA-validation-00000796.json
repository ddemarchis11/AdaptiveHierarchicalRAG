    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that Pramod Bhasin was the former CEO of Genpact and specifies that the company provided business process outsourcing solutions, which is supported by the context. However, the Gold Answer specifically mentions 'IT' services, which is a broader categorization that the Model Answer does not explicitly include. While the Model Answer is accurate and grounded, it misses the broader categorization of 'IT' services mentioned in the Gold Answer."
