    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the actress was born in 1954, whereas the Gold Answer specifies her birth date as 9 November 1955. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide any information about Karen Dotrice's birth year, making the claim unsupported and unfaithful to the context. The Model Answer fails to align with the Gold Answer and does not retrieve the necessary evidence."
