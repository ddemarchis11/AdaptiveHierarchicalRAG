    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to identify Francis Keogh Gleason as the individual who won an Academy Award for his work on the drama based on Rocky Graziano's life. The retrieved context does not explicitly mention Gleason, but the Model Answer does not provide any relevant or correct information either, making it incorrect and unfaithful to the question."
