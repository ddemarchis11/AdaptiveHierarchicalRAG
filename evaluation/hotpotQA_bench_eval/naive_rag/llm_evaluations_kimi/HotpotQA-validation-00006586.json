    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct name of the largest shipping facility in the Northeastern United States, which is the Port of Boston, as stated in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it does not address the question directly or include the key fact from the Gold Answer."
