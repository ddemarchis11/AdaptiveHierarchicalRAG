    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides specific species names for Chamelaucium and Vanilla, which are correct and supported by the context. However, the Gold Answer specifies 'flowers' as the general category, which the Model Answer does not explicitly mention. While the species names are accurate, the broader classification ('flowers') is omitted, leading to partial correctness and evidence coverage."
