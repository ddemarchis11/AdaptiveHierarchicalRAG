  "gold_answer": "29",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence provided does not specify how many days it took the Best New Artist of 2009 (Adele) to sell 2 million copies of an album in the UK or to break a twenty-year-old record.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about the number of days it took Adele to sell 2 million copies of an album in the UK or break a twenty-year-old record. However, it fails to answer the question directly, which is '29 days,' as stated in the Gold Answer. The retrieved context does not contain the necessary evidence to support the Gold Answer, so faithfulness is high, but correctness and evidence coverage are low."
