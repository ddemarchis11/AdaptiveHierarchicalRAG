  "question": "Which \"Blackzilians\" fighter is currently competing in the Middleweight division of Ultimate Fighting Championship?",

    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the evidence does not specify the fighter, which is incorrect as the Gold Answer identifies Vitor Belfort as the relevant fighter. The Retrieved Context does mention Vitor Belfort as a former Blackzilians member, but the Model Answer fails to utilize this information. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context in stating that no explicit mention of a current Blackzilians fighter in the Middleweight division is found, it does not correctly answer the question or cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
