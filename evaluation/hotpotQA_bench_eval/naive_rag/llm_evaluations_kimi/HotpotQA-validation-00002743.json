  "question": "Which one of the Long Island Herald newspaper chain serves a village in Nassau County, New York with a population of 6,483?",
  "gold_answer": "The Nassau Herald",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence does not specify any village in Nassau County with a population of exactly 6,483, nor does it identify a particular Long Island Herald newspaper serving such a village.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to identify 'The Nassau Herald' as the newspaper serving the village in Nassau County, which is the core of the Gold Answer. While the context does not explicitly mention the population of 6,483, it does provide sufficient information to connect 'The Nassau Herald' to Lawrence, a village in Nassau County. The Model Answer is faithful to the context but does not address the question correctly or cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
