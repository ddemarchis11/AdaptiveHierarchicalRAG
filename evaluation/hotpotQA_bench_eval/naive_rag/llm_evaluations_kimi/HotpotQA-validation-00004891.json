    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies 'Marvel' as the publisher, while the Model Answer states 'Marvel UK.' Although 'Marvel UK' is a division of Marvel, the Model Answer does not directly align with the Gold Answer. The context supports 'Marvel UK' as the publisher of 'The Daredevils,' but the question asks about the publisher of comic books featuring both Spider-Man and Daredevils, which is 'Marvel' as per the Gold Answer. Thus, the Model Answer is incorrect in terms of correctness and evidence coverage, but it is faithful to the retrieved context."
