As he turns round to face her, she suddenly realizes that the \"Captain\" is actually Arlecchino and begins reproaching him for his faithlessness, only pausing to powder her face. In response Arlecchino delivers a short speech concerning his views on marriage and fidelity: Die Treue, Madame, ist ein Laster, das meiner Ehrsamkeit nicht ansteht. – \"Fealty, madame, is a vice which does not apply to my respectability.\" 5b. Arietta. Arlecchino concludes by asking Colombina how she sleeps. Colombina changes her tune. Singing in alternating 3/4 and 2/4, she attempts to flatter Arlecchino, describing how other women envy her position as his wife. She then sings of her own virtues as a wife: she can dance and sing, and play the tambourine. As Colombina nestles up to him, Arlecchino, not taken in by her ploy, says: O Colombina, siehst du jenen Stern? - \"Oh Colombina, dost thou see yonder star?\" As Colombina gazes up at the night sky, he quickly makes his escape. 6.

ARLECCHINO als Sieger [Arlecchino as Conqueror] (Allegretto sostenuto) The roles in Arlecchino are derived from the Italian commedia dell'arte . It is unusual in that the title role of Arlecchino is primarily a speaking role. The composer has said that Arlecchino \"has a tendency to ambiguity and hyperbole in order to place the listener momentarily in a position of slight doubt.\" Ronald Stevenson has described it as an \"anti-opera,\" and an \"anti-war satire.\" Guido M. Gatti has commented that the opera itself illustrates Busoni's own particular ideas about opera as not depicting \"realistic events,\" and also making use of music not continuously, but instead when it is needed and words are insufficient alone to convey the ideas of the text. Larry Sitsky describes the music as \"tightly integrated\" and \"largely based on the 'row' [of tones] which appears as a fanfare at the commencement of the opera.\" And Henry Cowell has characterised this composition as \"the only opera to betray knowledge of Schoenberg 's early style before",

Performance history Its first performance was on March 1, 1950, at the Shubert Theatre in Philadelphia with Patricia Neway as the lead heroine Magda Sorel, Gloria Lane as the secretary of the consulate, Marie Powers as the mother, and Andrew McKinley as the magician Nika Magadoff. The opera opened two weeks later (March 15, 1950) at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in New York City where it enjoyed a run of nearly eight months (269 performances). It was initially conducted by Lehman Engel who was substituted by Thomas Schippers for nearly eight months until the last performance on November 4, 1950. Neway (alternating with Yul Brynner 's sister, Vera Brynner) also led the Broadway cast, this time with Rosemary Kuhlmann as the secretary of the consulate. Neway, Kuhlmann, and Powers also performed these roles in the UK at the Cambridge Theatre in February 1951, with Norman Kelley playing the role of the magician Nika. For the opera's La Scala debut in January 1951, Powers and McKinley reprised their roles, and Clara Petrella portrayed Magda.
