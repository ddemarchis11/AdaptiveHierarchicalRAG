They existed as a band for some time before they gave themselves a name, having only chosen the band's name \"Incubus\" when required to supply a band name for an upcoming show. The band's early shows were frequently at nightclubs on Los Angeles 's Sunset Strip , including such well-known venues as the Whisky a Go Go , the Roxy and the Troubadour.

Incubus produced many of their early recordings with Jim Wirt and Chillum Records in the Santa Monica studio 4th Street Recording, only able to work on their music during hours in which they were not in school. In 1994, they recorded their first two-song EP, Let Me Tell Ya 'Bout Root Beer . This was later followed by the debut album Fungus Amongus , also recorded with Wirt and released on Incubus's own label Stopuglynailfungus Music . Incubus then added Gavin Koppel (known by his stage name DJ Lyfe) to the band. In the following year, Incubus signed a seven-record deal with Sony 's Immortal Records , later to become Epic Records . The group was spotted by Epic/Immortal A&R Paul Pontius, who was also responsible for signing Korn to the label. The 1997 six-track EP Enjoy Incubus was the band's first major-label release and was created so the band could present a recording while touring with Korn in Europe. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. (1997–1998) S.C.I.E.N.C.E. , Incubus's second studio album, was released on September 9, 1997. After their album release,",

On February 1, 2007, five finalists were announced for the \"I Dig Incubus\" contest. In a video interview on Blender , bassist and vocalist Ben Kenney said, \"It's almost something that will happen whether or not we want to do it. People will make their own videos for songs. It's kind of a cool way for us to get together with fans out there who are artistic.\" On August 4, 2007, Incubus played on the first day at Baltimore 's Virgin Festival along with bands such as the Police and Beastie Boys . Michael Einziger had been suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome and although he had an operation that has corrected the problem, he needed to recuperate for a few months, hence recent tour plans were postponed. Incubus apologized to fans and continued the tour in the summer and autumn. In February and March 2008, Incubus hit the road again starting in New Zealand and headlining the Soundwave festival in Australia alongside the Offspring and Alexisonfire , and toured Asia performing to sell-out crowds. In Singapore, they met fans at a Meet and Greet session at Changi Airport and performed at Fort Canning Hill. In April, Incubus",

Incubus hinted that they would go on hiatus following the end of the 2012 Honda Civic Tour , but their manager stated that Incubus would only take a break after the tour, not a hiatus. In October 2012, the band released their second compilation album. The album, entitled The Essential Incubus , included songs spanning the band's major label career, from 1997's Enjoy Incubus EP to 2011's If Not Now, When? . In August 2013, the band announced a South American tour to take place later that year.  Later that year, the band was featured in an NME article titled \"28 Nu-Metal Era Bands You Probably Forgot All About\". Trust Fall (Side A) (2014–2015) In a radio interview while on the road with his solo band Sons of the Sea, Brandon Boyd announced that fans can expect some new Incubus music in 2015, followed by a tour.

      "text": "success in the early 2000s, Incubus was often grouped in with nu metal , alongside other Californian bands such as Korn and Deftones . NME described Incubus as a \"fusion-generated funk/nu-metal band\". Maui Time Weekly wrote, \"Incubus was one of the few nu metal bands to survive the purge of the millennium, and they did it through consistent hard work–the band is constantly either in the studio or on tour–and musical development. There are still elements of nu metal in the music the band makes today as they still have a DJ. But in retrospect, Incubus treated that genre like the fad it was, more an indication of that specific time in music, not as the character of the musicians.\" When asked about his thoughts on the scene in a 2013 interview, Brandon Boyd reflected \"Something I know that separated us from nu-metal was a lot of those bands had misogynist lyrics, and we never wrote stuff like that. I never wrote lyrics like that. I guess there were similarities in some of my musical and vocal stylings, but then we came off tour for S.C.I.E.N.C.E. around early '99, and wrote Make Yourself , which was a vastly different album but we were still the same band. We don't try and create any kind of album really. I don't attempt to write any kind of music, this is just what comes out.\" He also told Kerrang :",

Indian classical music has Vedic origins, and split in the 13th century into the two main traditions of Hindustani and Carnatic music. Hindustani is associated with North India and is more improvisational , featuring instruments such as the sitar and tabla , and Carnatic is South Indian and more focused on written compositions such as the kriti , while both styles contain common elements such as the raga melodic framework and tala rhythmic meter.
