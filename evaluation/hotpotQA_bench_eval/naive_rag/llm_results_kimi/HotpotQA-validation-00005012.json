The band currently consists of Aaron Cometbus (drums, lyrics ), Bill Schneider (bass), Billie Joe Armstrong (guitar, vocals) and Jason White (guitar, vocals). The band's name comes from a brand of \"high octane\" green tea served at the Arcata co-op that was discovered by Aaron Cometbus during one of his many dumpster diving adventures.

Cometbus wanted the name \"Pinhead Gunpowder\", while Quittner wanted to call it \"50 Foot Hesher\".

Shortly after the show, Cometbus moved back to Berkeley, taking the name of the band and some of the songs with him.
