      "text": "HMAS Narani was an auxiliary minesweeper operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) during World War II. Narani was requisitioned from the Illawarra & South Coast Steam Navigation Company as auxiliaries . The 381-ton vessel was armed with a 12-pounder 12cwt QF gun , a 20mm Oerlikon cannon, a .303-inch Vickers machine gun , and four Type D depth charges , and was commissioned into the RAN on 11 June 1941. During the war, Narani , Uki , and Bermagui made up Group 77 Minesweeper, based at HMAS Maitland , in Newcastle, New South Wales . Returned to her owners on 10 July 1946, she plied the coastal trade until 1951 when she was sold to New Guinea Borneo Mangrove Co., Port Moresby. She was broken up in 1954.

      "text": "1927 a muzzle flash suppressor was added on the Mk. II*. As the machine gun armament of US and UK fighter aircraft moved from the fuselage to the wings in the years before World War II , the Vickers was generally replaced by the faster-firing and more reliable Browning Model 1919 using metal-linked cartridges. The Gloster Gladiator was the last RAF fighter to be armed with the Vickers, later replaced by Brownings. The Fairey Swordfish was fitted with the weapon until production ended in August 1944. Several British bombers and attack aircraft of the Second World War mounted the Vickers K machine gun or VGO, a completely different design, more closely resembling the Lewis gun in external appearance. Vickers machine guns, designated as models E (pilot's) and F (observer's, fed from a pan magazine ) were also used among others in Poland, where 777 of them were converted to 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge in 1933–1937. Use in armored vehicles The water-cooled Vickers Mark VI, Mark VI* and Mark VII were versions of the Mark I for use in tanks. They were introduced in 1936 and declared obsolete in 1944 (though they and the vehicles they were installed in were still in reserve use until the 1960s). They could be installed with either a left-hand or right-hand feed block. The Mark VI and VI* Tank Patterns were conversions",

      "text": "The Vickers machine gun or Vickers gun is a water-cooled .303 British (7.7 mm) machine gun produced by Vickers Limited , originally for the British Army . The gun was operated by a three-man crew, but typically required more men to move and operate it: one fired, one fed the ammunition, the others helped to carry the weapon, its ammunition, and spare parts. It was in service from before the First World War until the 1960s, with air-cooled versions of it on many Allied World War I fighter aircraft . The weapon had a reputation for great solidity and reliability. Ian V. Hogg , in Weapons & War Machines , describes an action that took place in August 1916, during which the British 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps fired their ten Vickers guns to deliver sustained fire for twelve hours. Using 100 barrels, they fired a million rounds without breakdowns. \"It was this absolute foolproof reliability which endeared the Vickers to every British soldier who ever fired one. It never broke down; it just kept on firing and came back for more.\" History A Vickers machine gun crew in action at the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge , September 1917 The Vickers machine gun was based on the successful Maxim gun of the late 19th century. After purchasing the Maxim company outright in 1896, Vickers took the design of the Maxim gun and improved it, inverting the mechanism",
