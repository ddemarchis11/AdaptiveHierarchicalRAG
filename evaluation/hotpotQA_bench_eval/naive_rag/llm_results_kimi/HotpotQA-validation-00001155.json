Biography Sarmiento was born in the Chilean municipality of Valparaíso and was first exposed to film at the age of five, becoming familiar with the work of Orson Welles , Alfred Hitchcock and others. She rarely saw French films due to censorship but, thanks to what she refers to as a \"moment of magic\", was able to watch Jean-Luc Godard 's Breathless (1960) at the age of twelve. She went on to study film and philosophy at the University of Valparaíso and married filmmaker Raúl Ruiz in 1969. In 1974, the couple were forced to move to Paris due to the 1973 Chilean coup d'état of Augusto Pinochet .
