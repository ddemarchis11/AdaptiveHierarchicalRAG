      "text": "McLemore Avenue is the tenth studio album by the American southern soul group Booker T. & the M.G.s , consisting entirely of mostly instrumental versions of songs from the Beatles' album Abbey Road (released only months earlier, in September 1969). The title and cover are an homage to the Beatles album, 926 East McLemore Avenue being the address of the Stax Studios in Memphis , as Abbey Road was for London ’s EMI Studios , which were soon renamed Abbey Road Studios. As a nod to Abbey Road's medley, most of the M.G.s' selections are arranged into their own medleys. (\" Something \" was released as a single and reached number 76 in the US). The album itself peaked at No. 107 in the US. Booker T. Jones said, \"I was in California when I heard Abbey Road , and I thought it was incredibly courageous of The Beatles to drop their format and move out musically like they did. To push the limit like that and reinvent themselves when they had no need to do that. They were the top band in the world but they still reinvented themselves. The music was just incredible so I felt I needed to pay tribute to it.\" Track listing All songs written by Lennon–McCartney except \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\", by George Harrison Side one Medley: \" Golden Slumbers \", \" Carry That Weight \", \" The End \" (with vocals), \" Here Comes",

      "text": "Abbey Road is a thoroughfare in the borough of Camden and the City of Westminster in Greater London running roughly northwest to southeast through St John's Wood near Lord's Cricket Ground . It is part of the road B507. The road is best known for the Abbey Road Studios and for featuring on the cover of the Beatles ' album of the same name , which was released in September 1969. Location The northwestern end of Abbey Road begins in Kilburn at the junction with Quex Road and West End Lane . The road was once a track leading to Kilburn Priory and its associated Abbey Farm and was developed in the beginning of the nineteenth century. It continues southeast for roughly one mile crossing Priory Road , Belsize Road , Boundary Road (which forms the Camden/Westminster boundary) and Marlborough Place , ending at the junction of Grove End Road and Garden Road. It is joined from the west by Abercorn Place .

The Beatles named their last studio LP after this street, and the album's cover photograph shows the four group members walking across the zebra crossing just outside the studio entrance. As a result of its association with the Beatles, this part of Abbey Road has been featured on the London tourism circuit. The crossing was given the official status of Grade II listed building by English Heritage in December 2010. The zebra crossing featured on the Beatles cover has become a popular photo opportunity area, despite the road still being a busy thoroughfare for traffic. The crossing may have been relocated several metres as part of traffic management work in the 1970s, with a spokesperson for Westminster City Council saying in 2010 that \"by comparing photographs with the Ordnance Survey maps, we believe that the crossing might have been further north nearer 3 Abbey Road, which was the front house of the EMI Studios, because the steps of Neville Court appear to the right of the crossing in original photographs of the crossing, whereas the present crossing is near the junction of Abbey Road and Grove End Road\". The Beatles' album cover has been parodied many times over the years. The street sign on the corner of Grove End Road and Abbey Road, which was frequently defaced or stolen, is now",
