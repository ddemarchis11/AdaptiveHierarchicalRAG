      "text": "\" Quiet in Heaven \"/\" Song of Liberty \" is a 1983 double A-side single by the American post-punk band Faith. No Man. Recorded at producer Matt Wallace 's home studio, the single was the band's only release before the majority of its members left to form Faith No More the following year; keyboard player Wade Worthington had already been replaced between the single's recording and its release. Both songs were written by singer and guitarist Mike Morris, who is also credited with the single's artwork—including a picture of Adolf Hitler wearing a tutu on the record's A-side . The music has been favorably reviewed since its release, with the group being compared to Joy Division , Public Image Ltd and Killing Joke . Production Faith. No Man had begun life in 1981 under the name Sharp Young Men, comprising the lineup of singer and guitarist Mike Morris, bass player Billy Gould , drummer Mike Bordin and keyboard player Wade Worthington. Morris and Worthington had played together in a previous band named The Spectators, opening for shows by XTC and Dead Kennedys , and recruited the other members after advertising for their new band in a Berkeley, California record store. Morris acted as the group's primary songwriter, and penned several original songs for their early performances; \"Quiet in Heaven\", \"Decay\", \"Life Is Tough for Me\", \"Under the Gun\", and \"Song of Liberty\"—the latter two of which he has since described as",

      "text": "\"Life Is Tough for Me\", \"Under the Gun\", and \"Song of Liberty\"—the latter two of which he has since described as \"hitting [his] mark\" as a writer. Still operating under the Sharp Young Men name, the group recorded three songs in Matt Wallace 's Dangerous Rhythm Studios , located in the garage of his parents' home in Moraga, California . Between the time of the recording session and the release of the single, Worthington quit the band and was replaced on keyboards by Gould's childhood friend Roddy Bottum ; the group's name was also changed to Faith. No Man around this time. After touring California throughout early 1983, Bottum, Gould and Bordin quit the band shortly after and formed Faith No More without any constant guitarists or vocalists until they eventually settled on Chuck Mosley and Jim Martin . The single has been long out of print, making it very difficult to find. The artwork, which was credited to Morris, features amongst other things an edited picture of Adolf Hitler wearing a tutu on the A-side of the disc. Reception \"Quiet in Heaven\"/\"Song of Liberty\" was released in 1983 on the band's own label, Ministry of Propaganda, and initially attracted the attention of punk collective Crass and the English record label On-U Sound Records ; however the band had dissolved before they could be signed to any deal. Reviews of the single have largely been favorable. A contemporary review in",

It was originally designed by bassist Billy Gould as an homage to the Symbol of Chaos . Early days (1979–1984) The genesis of Faith No More was the group Sharp Young Men, formed in 1979, by vocalist Mike Morris and keyboardist Wade Worthington. Drummer Mike Bordin and bassist Billy Gould joined afterwards. Morris called the name \"a piss-take on all the 'elegant' groups at the time.\" Later, he proposed the name Faith In No Man, but eventually the band settled on Bordin's suggestion, Faith No Man (stylized as Faith. No Man). The band recorded \" Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty \", released in 1983. The songs were recorded in Matt Wallace 's parents' garage, where Wallace had set up and been running a recording studio while the band was still recording under the name Sharp Young Men, with Morris, Gould, Bordin and Worthington. Worthington left shortly thereafter. The band's name was changed to Faith No Man for the release of the single, which featured two of the three songs recorded in Wallace's garage, and Roddy Bottum replaced Worthington. Bottum, Gould and Bordin quit the band shortly after and formed Faith No More. They chose the name in September",

      "text": "\" Man Next Door \" (also known as \" Quiet Place \" or \" I've Got to Get Away \") is a song composed and adapted by John Holt and first recorded by his group The Paragons in 1968. Holt's song is partially based on the original composition, \"Quiet Place\", recorded by Soul R & B artist Garnet Mimms & The Enchanters, released in 1963 on his Cry Baby album. The Paragons version was produced by Duke Reid and first released on his Duke label as the B-side of \"Left with a Broken Heart\". The song has been covered by numerous other reggae artists including Dennis Brown , UB40 and Horace Andy who also sang on a more electronic version of the song for the Massive Attack album Mezzanine , with samples of the drum break from Led Zeppelin 's cover of \" When the Levee Breaks \" and The Cure 's \" 10:15 Saturday Night \". The song was released as a single by The Slits in 1980, when it reached number 5 on the UK Indie Chart , staying on the chart for 13 weeks. Holt's version also formed the basis of L.E.G.A.C.Y. 's rap version, while Horace Andy's \"Quiet Place\" was used as the basis of deejay versions from Dr Alimantado (\"Poison Flour\" and \"I Shall Fear No Evil\"), I-Roy (\"Noisy Place\") and The",

He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young's earliest recordings. Those four sides were released on Vocalion Records under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were \"Shoe Shine Boy\", \"Evening\", \"Boogie Woogie\", and \"Oh Lady Be Good\". After Vocalion became a subsidiary of Columbia Records in 1938, \"Boogie Woogie\" was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled Boogie Woogie (Columbia album C44). When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with Decca Records , but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937. By then, Basie's sound was characterized by a \"jumping\" beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano. His personnel around 1937 included: Lester Young and Herschel Evans (tenor sax), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Walter Page (bass), Earle Warren (alto sax), Buck Clayton and Harry Edison (trumpet), Benny Morton and Dickie Wells (trombone). Lester Young, known as \"Prez\" by the band, came up with nicknames for all the other band members. He called Basie",
