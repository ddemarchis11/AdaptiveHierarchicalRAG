      "text": "Sir Fred Hoyle (24 June 1915 – 20 August 2001) was an English astronomer . With Margaret and Geoffrey Burbidge and William Alfred Fowler , he formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis in the influential B 2 FH paper . He held controversial views on some scientific matters — in particular, in his rejection of the \" Big Bang \" theory (a term he jokingly coined on BBC Radio , though he later denied doing so in derision) in favour of a \" steady-state model \", and his promotion of panspermia as the origin of life on Earth. He spent most of his working life at St John's College, Cambridge , and served as the founding director of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy at Cambridge. Hoyle also wrote science fiction novels, short stories, and radio plays, co-created television serials, and co-authored twelve books with his son, Geoffrey Hoyle . Biography Early life Hoyle was born near Bingley in Gilstead , West Riding of Yorkshire , England. His father Ben Hoyle was a violinist and worked in the wool trade in Bradford , and served as a machine gunner in the First World War . His mother, Mabel Pickard, had studied music at the Royal College of Music in London and later worked as a cinema pianist. Hoyle was educated at Bingley Grammar School and read mathematics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge . As a youth, he sang in the choir at the local Anglican",

      "text": "The B 2 FH paper was a landmark scientific paper on the origin of the chemical elements. The paper's title is Synthesis of the Elements in Stars , but it became known as B 2 FH from the initials of its authors: Margaret Burbidge , Geoffrey Burbidge , William A. Fowler , and Fred Hoyle . It was written from 1955 to 1956 at the University of Cambridge and Caltech and published in Reviews of Modern Physics in 1957. The B 2 FH paper reviewed stellar nucleosynthesis theory and supported it with astronomical and laboratory data. It identified nucleosynthesis processes that are responsible for producing the elements heavier than iron and explained their relative abundances . The paper became highly influential in both astronomy and nuclear physics . Nucleosynthesis prior to 1957 Prior to the publication of the B 2 FH paper, George Gamow advocated a theory of the Universe in which almost all chemical elements , or equivalently atomic nuclei , were synthesized during the Big Bang . Gamow's theory (which differs from present-day Big Bang nucleosynthesis theory) would imply that the abundance of the chemical elements would remain mostly static over time. Arthur Eddington had speculated that the conversion of hydrogen into helium by nuclear fusion could provide the energy required to power stars in 1920. Hans Bethe and Charles L. Critchfield had shown the mechanism for stellar fusion of helium by deriving the proton–proton chain (pp-chain) in",

      "text": "(he published his prescient and groundbreaking paper in 1954). He also formed a group at Cambridge exploring stellar nucleosynthesis in ordinary stars and was bothered by the paucity of stellar carbon production in existing models. He noticed that one existing process would be made a billion times more productive if the carbon-12 nucleus had a resonance at 7.7 MeV, but nuclear physicists at the time omitted such an observed value. On another trip, he visited the nuclear physics group at Caltech, spent a few months of sabbatical there and persuaded them against their scepticism to find the Hoyle state in carbon-12, from which a full theory of stellar nucleosynthesis was developed, co-authored by Hoyle and members of the Caltech group. Blue plaque at Bingley Grammar School commemorating Hoyle In 1945, after the war ended, Hoyle returned to Cambridge University as a lecturer at St John's College, Cambridge (where he had been a Fellow since 1939). Hoyle's Cambridge years, 1945–1973, saw him rise to the top of world astrophysics theory, on the basis of a startling originality of ideas covering a wide range of topics. In 1958, Hoyle was appointed Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy in Cambridge University. In 1967, he became the founding director of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy (subsequently renamed the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge ), where his innovative",

Carl von Weizsäcker and Hans Bethe had independently derived the CNO cycle in 1938 and 1939, respectively. Thus, it was known by Gamow and others that the abundances of hydrogen and helium were not perfectly static. According to their view, fusion in stars would produce small amounts of helium, adding only slightly to its abundance from the Big Bang. This stellar nuclear power did not require substantial stellar nucleosynthesis . The elements from carbon upward remained a mystery. Fred Hoyle offered a hypothesis for the origin of heavy elements. Beginning with a paper in 1946, and expanded upon in 1954, Hoyle proposed that all atomic nuclei heavier than lithium were synthesized in stars . Both theories agreed that some light nuclei (hydrogen, helium and a small amount of lithium) were not produced in stars, which became the now-accepted theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis of H, He and Li. Physics in the paper The B 2 FH paper was ostensibly a review article summarising recent advances in the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis . However, it went beyond simply reviewing Hoyle's work, by incorporating observational measurements of elemental abundances published by the Burbidges, and Fowler's laboratory experiments on nuclear reactions. The result was a synthesis of theory and observation, which provided convincing evidence",

      "text": "20 August of that year. Views and contributions Origin of nucleosynthesis Hoyle authored the first two research papers ever published on synthesis of chemical elements heavier than helium by stellar nuclear reactions. The first of these in 1946 showed that cores of stars will evolve to temperatures of billions of degrees, much hotter than temperatures considered for thermonuclear origin of stellar power in main-sequence stars. Hoyle showed that at such high temperatures the element iron can become much more abundant than other heavy elements owing to thermal equilibrium among nuclear particles, explaining the high natural abundance of iron. This idea would later be called the e Process. Hoyle's second foundational nucleosynthesis publication, published in 1954, showed that the elements between carbon and iron cannot be synthesised by such equilibrium processes. He attributed those elements to specific nuclear fusion reactions between abundant constituents in concentric shells of evolved massive, pre-supernova stars. This startlingly modern picture is the accepted paradigm today for the supernova nucleosynthesis of these primary elements. In the mid-1950s, Hoyle became the leader of a group of talented experimental and theoretical physicists who met in Cambridge: William Alfred Fowler , Margaret Burbidge , and Geoffrey Burbidge . This group systematised basic ideas of how all the chemical elements in our universe were created, with this now being a field called nucleosynthesis . Famously, in 1957, this group produced the B 2 FH paper (known for the initials of the",
