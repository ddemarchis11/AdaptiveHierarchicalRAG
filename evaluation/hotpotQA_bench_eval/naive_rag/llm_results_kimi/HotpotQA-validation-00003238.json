      "text": "Not Richard, But Dick is the seventh studio album by the Dead Milkmen , released in 1993 via Hollywood Records . Like Soul Rotation , the album was a commercial disappointment. After being out of print for years, Hollywood Records released the album for digital download on April 2, 2013. The title of the album is not a reference to \"Tricky\" Dick Nixon (former POTUS Richard M. Nixon ), but rather a person by the name of Richard J. \"Dick\" Latch, who preferred to be addressed as \"Not Richard, but Dick.\" Production The album was produced by Jon Lupfer and the band. Critical reception Trouser Press wrote that \"the simplified Not Richard, but Dick favors down-the-hatch indie-rock, which suits the Milkmen fine but doesn’t make for as entertaining an experience.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that \"the band expresses the discontent of today's teens and twentysomethings with a vividness rarely summoned by even conscientiously 'righteous' rockers.\" The Tampa Bay Times thought that \"the Milkmen have always had problems making their punkish songs live up to the great titles ... on Not Richard, But Dick they again weigh in with some classic bits of satire and fall short on a few other occasions.\" The Scripps Howard News Service deemed the album \"a goofy palate of cultural references sure to prompt laughter and groans.\" Track listing \"Leggo My Ego\" - 2:21 \"I Dream",

In 1968, the band switched focus, going electric and recruiting two fellow musicians from Boston band The Hallucinations, drummer Stephen Jo Bladd and vocalist Peter Blankfield, a fast-talking former WBCN disc jockey with the air name Peter Wolf . Initial influences included James Cotton and Little Walter – in a 2008 interview, harmonica star Magic Dick said they were all \"harp freaks\". They became The J. Geils Blues Band, later dropping the word \"Blues\" from the band name. Fan Seth Justman joined on keyboards and the band started to earn a sizable following in the Boston area. The band took its time carefully considering various offers of contracts. Unofficial live recordings circulated: as noted in Creem , \"WBCN had the infamous J. Geils 'bathroom tapes' (that were almost exactly what the name implies) and a tape of their performance at Alternate Media Conference at Goddard College, but these hardly sufficed\" to fans who wanted a proper album. The group ultimately signed to Atlantic Records in 1970. 1970s touring, recordings and early top 40 success After spending the better part of 1970 playing live shows around the US opening for artists as eclectic as B.

Geils Blues Band ) was an American rock band formed in 1967, in Worcester, Massachusetts , under the leadership of guitarist John \"J.\" Geils . The original band members included vocalist Peter Wolf , harmonica, trumpet, and saxophone player Richard \"Magic Dick\" Salwitz , drummer Stephen Bladd, vocalist/keyboardist Seth Justman , and bassist Danny Klein . Wolf and Justman served as principal songwriters. The band played R&B -influenced blues rock during the 1970s, and achieved commercial success before moving toward a more mainstream new wave sound in the early 1980s, which brought the band to its commercial peak. They performed a mix of cover songs of classic blues and R&B songs, along with original compositions written primarily by Wolf and Justman, as well as some group compositions written under the pseudonymous name Juke Joint Jimmy . After Wolf left the band in 1983 to pursue a solo career, the band released one more album in 1984 with Justman and Bladd on lead vocals, before breaking up in 1985. Beginning in 1999, the band had several reunions until the death of its namesake, J. Geils, on April 11, 2017. The band first released several Top 40 singles in the early",

Walewander invited the band to Tiger Stadium to see a game in which he hit his first and only major league home run. In 1988, they issued Beelzebubba , a comparatively polished record that yielded their most successful single, \" Punk Rock Girl \". Featuring Genaro on lead vocals, the track saw extensive rotation on MTV and propelled the album to number 101 on Billboard 's Top 200. They later released the Smokin' Banana Peels EP and music video from this album. The 1990 followup, Metaphysical Graffiti , did not yield a hit, but also charted and helped solidify the group's presence in the independent rock scene. Stint with Hollywood Records; breakup (1991–95) In 1991, the band left Restless and signed with The Walt Disney Company -owned Hollywood Records . Soul Rotation , their Hollywood debut released the following year, was focused more heavily on Genaro's singing and songwriting, with Linderman used predominantly as a keyboardist. The resulting record was much more pop -oriented than the group's previous efforts, but failed to produce a hit single. Not Richard, But Dick was issued in 1993, and did not fare any better than its predecessor. Relations between the band and label quickly soured, and",
