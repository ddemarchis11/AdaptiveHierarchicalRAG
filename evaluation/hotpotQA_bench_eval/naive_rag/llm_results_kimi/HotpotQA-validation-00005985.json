However, Trump stated that it was his decision to end the relationship with NBC \"out of respect\", even though he had been approached by Burnett and NBC to host two more seasons of the show just prior to his presidential bid. In an April 2016 interview, Trump revealed he earned about $213 million from the show over its 14 seasons. In September 2015, NBC announced that actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger would become the new host of The Celebrity Apprentice to premiere during the 2016–17 television season. The rebooted series, The New Celebrity Apprentice first broadcast on January 2, 2017. Trump remained credited as an Executive Producer to the show, including what was estimated as a five-figure per-show fee as well as ongoing profits from the franchise through MGM, the production entity for the show. On March 3, 2017, NBC announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger had stepped down as host of The Celebrity Apprentice . Schwarzenegger cited poor ratings as well as his feud with President Trump as factors in his decision.

Coincidentally John Rich was the opposing project manager in 2 of 3 non-finale tasks that Marlee Matlin stints as a project manager. Their records are 2-1 (John Rich) and 1-1 (Marlee Matlin) prior to the finale. Episode 12: Sweet Victory (Season Finale) Airdate: May 22, 2011 Prologue: This is a continuation of the previous episode, Retro Rumble , which is interspersed with commentary by Trump from the telecast of the live finale. The Celebrity Apprentice will be crowned live at the end of the episode. Also Don Jr. made the comment to John Rich about the Stetson hat that John gave to Trump. Tension: Marlee's team is frustrated because in addition to her lack of leadership, their celebrity Geoffrey Holder may not appear to film the commercial due to contractual issues. On the other hand, John Rich may have sabotaged himself because he announces the beginning of the Def Leppard concert before they are ready to appear. The Celebrity Apprentice: John Rich – For his very strong track record throughout the season, his quick thinking in salvaging the concert after the Def Leppard mishap, and for having made up what looked like an insurmountable gap to Marlee Matlin's",

Runner Up : Marlee Matlin – While Trump said that she would have easily won any previous season of the show, he deemed her to simply not have done as strong of a job as John Rich on this task. Marlee also didn't help her cause by failing to carry out any fundraising on the task, with Trump strongly implying that had she raised any appreciable amount of funds, she would have won. Notes: John Rich decided to carry out additional fundraising at his event, and earned approximately $300,000 more for his charity, bringing his total before being awarded the final prize to $1,036,908, which put him just $13,092 behind Marlee Matlin. In contrast, Marlee focused solely on running her event and didn't raise any additional money. In the live finale Marlee attempted to argue that the extra money raised by John should be disallowed, since the two finalists were never told to raise money, but John countered by pointing out that fundraising had been a part of all three prior Celebrity Apprentice finales, and Trump added that he never told either of them not to raise funds.
