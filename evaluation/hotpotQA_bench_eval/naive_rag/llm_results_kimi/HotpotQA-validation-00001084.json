The game is the third entry in the Red Dead series and a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption . The story is set in a fictionalized representation of the United States in 1899 and follows the exploits of Arthur Morgan , an outlaw and member of the Van der Linde gang, who must face the challenges of a declining Wild West , while attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The game is presented through first- and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam its interactive open world . Gameplay elements include shootouts , robberies , hunting , horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters , and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player. The game's development lasted over eight years, beginning soon after Red Dead Redemption ' s release, and it became one of the most expensive video games ever made. Rockstar co-opted all of its studios into one large team to facilitate development. They drew influence from real locations as opposed to film or art, focused on creating an accurate reflection of the time with the game's characters and world. The game was Rockstar's first built specifically for eighth-generation consoles , having tested their technical capabilities while porting Grand Theft Auto V .

      "text": "In July 2021, a study published by the University of Exeter and Truro and Penwith College found Red Dead Redemption 2 players had an increased understanding of ecology and animal behavior; players were able to identify three more animals on average than other gamers. In late 2021, University of Tennessee professor Tore Olsson started teaching \" Red Dead America\", a class about United States history in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including the frontier myth , Jim Crow laws , settler colonialism , and women's suffrage , inspired by the lack of academic discourse surrounding the game's history. Olsson found the class attracted larger enrollments than other history subjects. He published a book about the topic, titled Red Dead's History , in August 2024; the audiobook is narrated by Roger Clark, who portrayed Arthur.

      "text": "full development commenced in 2006, following the formation of a core development team. Rockstar San Diego 's 180-person team co-opted Rockstar's Leeds , New England , North , and Toronto studios to facilitate development between a full team of over 1,000. Having exhausted the use of previous hardware on other projects, Rockstar felt inspired after realizing the potential power of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget between US$80 million and US$100 million , which would make it one of the most expensive video games to develop . The game's development received controversy following accusations of unethical working practices at Rockstar San Diego, including twelve-hour workdays and six-day weeks, with a lower-than-the-industry-average salary increase. Red Dead Redemption ' s 1,500-page script was written in two years. Taking inspiration from films like The Wild Bunch (1969), High Plains Drifter (1973), Unforgiven (1992), and The Proposition (2005), the team felt that most Western fiction takes place between 1840 and 1880, and that Red Dead Redemption ' s setting in 1911 allowed a more intriguing analysis of the transformation from \"the old West \" into the modern world. Regarding the game's depiction of violence, the team wanted it to \"feel slightly raw and unpleasant\", attempting realism without exaggeration.
