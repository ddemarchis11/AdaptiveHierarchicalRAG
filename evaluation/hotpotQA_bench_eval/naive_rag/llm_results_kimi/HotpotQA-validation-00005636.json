By the mid-1980s, Billy Gould stated the band were in a \"weird spot\", as their eclectic sound didn't fit in with the burgeoning hardcore punk and alternative rock movements of the era. Upon Mike Patton's arrival in 1988, the band began to expand their sound range even further, merging disparate genres such as synth-pop , thrash metal , and carousel music on The Real Thing . Rolling Stone states that by 1997, the band were \"too heavy for the post-grunge pop hits of The Verve and Third Eye Blind [and] too arty to work comfortably with the nu metal knuckle-draggers they spawned.\" Over the course of their career, they have experimented with heavy metal , funk , hip hop , progressive rock , alternative rock, hardcore punk , polka , country , easy listening , jazz , samba , ska , bossa nova , hard rock , pop , soul , trip hop , gospel , and lounge music . Faith No More's lyrics have been described as \"bizarrely humorous\". When interviewed about his lyrics, Patton responded, \"I think that too many people think too much about my lyrics. I am more a person who works more with the sound of a word than with its meaning. Often I just choose the words because of the",

On 6 June 2012, Muse released a trailer for their next album, The 2nd Law , with a countdown on the band's website. The trailer, which included dubstep elements, was met with mixed reactions. On 7 June, Muse announced a European Arena tour, the first leg of The 2nd Law Tour . The leg included dates in France, Spain and the UK.

Less common labels applied at some point include heavy metal , rap rock , rap metal , funk metal , groove metal and hard rock . The band is characterized by a style that incorporates downtuned guitars , a groove-heavy rhythm section, haunted atmospheric production, and dark lyrics. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes. Historically, when Life Is Peachy was released, the band's music was not yet labeled \"nu metal\". Thus, in November 1996, Korn was described as \"one of the key players in an American metal revival\" alongside Deftones , \"two bands that share the same roots\". In the music community, there have been disagreements whether the band should be considered as \"heavy metal\". In 2015, lead singer Jonathan Davis commented, \"Yeah, we're heavy and downtuned, but metal, to me, is like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden , that's metal man. I always thought of us as a funk band.\" Additionally, in an interview with Metal Hammer , Davis said that he had hated the \"nu metal\" tag. Korn is widely credited as the originators of the nu metal scene. It means that the genre was suddenly inundated with imitators of their sound. Brian Welch told Metal",

While declaring that Sleepless in Seattle remains the best romantic comedy ever released, Body+Soul contributor Hannah-Rose Yee said despite being \"the kind of movie that gives romantic comedies a bad name ... no film has come close to distilling what Sleepless in Seattle does about the ridiculous enterprise that is opening up your heart to someone else\". However, she admitted that one's ability to enjoy the film depends \"entirely on how on board you can get with a romance in which the two lead characters don't meet until the last five minutes\". The Guardian 's Luke Walpole, who had avoided watching the film until 2020 in fear that it had aged poorly, ultimately found Ephron's screenplay to be a gorgeous \"balance of melancholy and fizzing optimism\", but criticized Sleepless in Seattle' s \"narrowly middle class and privileged\" characters. Common Sense Media wrote that the film is successful in Ephron's hands, despite its \"frustrating\" structure at times. Siede noted that in recent years, Annie's actions in pursuit of Sam have been re-evaluated as what some critics perceive as stalker behavior, with Nicole Sperling of Vanity Fair feeling Annie's determination \"verges into stalker territory\".
