Unlike most other pop singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the Billboard Country Chart . In the 1970s, she shifted her style more toward country music and began having even more success on the country charts, ending up as one of the few vocalists to have charted in five separate decades. With the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s, mainstream popular music record sales began to decline. Page was among the few pop singers who were able to maintain popularity, continuing to have hits well into the 1960s, with \" Old Cape Cod \", \" Allegheny Moon \", \" A Poor Man's Roses (or a Rich Man's Gold) \", and \" Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte \". In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame . She was posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013.

In 1950, she had her first million-selling single \" With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming \", and eventually had 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965.
