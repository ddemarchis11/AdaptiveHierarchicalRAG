Diocese of Cashel The Diocese of Cashel was elevated to the rank of ecclesiastical province, which was roughly co-extensive with the traditional province of Munster , by the Synod of Kells in 1152. Since the Papal Legate , Giovanni Paparoni , awarded the pallium to Donat O'Lonergan in 1158, his successors ruled the ecclesiastical province of Cashel – also sometimes known as Munster – until 26 January 2015.

      "text": "The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bamenda is the metropolitan see of the ecclesiastical province of Bamenda in Cameroon . It was by the bull Tametsi Christianarum , of 13 August 1970, that Pope Paul VI erected the Diocese of Bamenda with territory detached from the Diocese of Buéa. On 18 March 1982 Pope John Paul II created, by the bull Eo Magis Ecclesia Catholica , the Archdiocese of Bamenda and the Ecclesiastical Province of Bamenda, and erected the Diocese of Kumbo with territory detached from the Diocese of Bamenda. Bamenda was by the same bull made into the metropolitan see of the ecclesiastical province with Buéa and Kumbo as its suffragans. Mamfe was later created into a diocese with territory detached from Buéa. Bamenda, therefore, has three suffragan sees: Buéa, Kumbo and Mamfe. As of November 2013 there are 35 parishes in Bamenda divided into six deaneries: Njinikom, Mankon, Widikum, Bambui, Wum and Ndop.

The diocese covers the historic county of Dorset (which excludes the deaneries of Bournemouth and Christchurch , which fall within the Diocese of Winchester as they were historically in Hampshire), most of Wiltshire (excepting an area in the north and Swindon ), and the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey . The diocese is led by Stephen Lake , Bishop of Salisbury , and by the diocesan synod . The bishop's seat is at Salisbury Cathedral . History Catholic The Diocese of Sherborne (founded c. AD 705 ) was the origin of the present diocese; St Aldhelm was its first Bishop of Sherborne . The Diocese of Ramsbury was created from the northwestern territory of the Bishop of Winchester in 909. Herman of Wilton was appointed bishop of Ramsbury , covering Wiltshire and Berkshire, by Edward the Confessor in 1045. In or after 1059 he was also appointed Sherborne , covering Dorset, uniting the two dioceses. In 1075",

Disputes between the bishops Herbert and Richard Poore and the sheriffs of Wiltshire led to the removal of the see in the 1220s to a new site. This was chartered as the city of New Sarum by King Henry III in 1227, but it was not until the 14th century that the office was described (by Robert Wyvil ) as the Bishop of Sarum ( episcopus Sarum ). The diocese, like the city, is now known as Salisbury. The archdeaconry around Salisbury, however, retains the name of Sarum. Anglican Reforms within the Church of England led to the annexation of Dorset from the abolished diocese of Bristol in 1836; Berkshire , however, was removed the same year and given to Oxford . In 1925 and 1974, new suffragan bishops were appointed to assist the Bishop of Salisbury; the new offices were titled the bishops of Sherborne and Ramsbury , respectively. Until 2009 the bishops operated under an episcopal area scheme established in 1981, with each suffragan bishop having a formal geographical area of responsibility, and being known as \"area bishops\". The Bishop of Ramsbury had oversight of the diocese's parishes",
