      "text": "S40 and V50. Reports suggested that Volvo was considering a broader 40-series lineup, including a sedan, a wagon, a hatchback, a coupe, a convertible, an SUV, and a crossover. Ultimately, Volvo introduced three models in the compact premium segment: the XC40/EX40, the EC40, and the Polestar 2. The XC40, launched in 2017, became Volvo's primary compact model, while the fully electric EC40 followed in 2023. Meanwhile, the Polestar 2, introduced in 2020, served as a sedan-like alternative under Volvo's performance brand, Polestar. However, a direct sedan or station wagon successor to the S40 and V50 was never produced.

Powered by inline-four and straight-five engines , the C30 is a variant of the Volvo S40/V50 / C70 range, sharing the same Ford C1/Volvo P1 platform. Volvo marketed the C30 as a premium hatchback / sports coupe . The C30's rear styling and frameless glass rear hatch recall Volvo's earlier P1800 ES and Volvo 480 . Pre-production concepts Volvo SCC (2001) The Volvo SCC (Safety Concept Car) is a concept vehicle incorporating the rear hatch design from the Volvo P1800ES and the glass hatch from Volvo 480ES . Its safety features included forward collision warning , blind spot monitor and alert, lane departure warning , adaptive cruise control , flashing brake lights during hard braking, and headlights that follow the curvature of the road as the car turns. Many of these features would become commonplace years later. The SCC also featured a head-up display and communication with the car via mobile phone. The SCC was first unveiled at the 2001 Detroit Auto Show , then in autumn 2001 at the Seville International Airport in southern Spain. Research to adapt its safety features for production began in 2002, and it led to development of the C30 which began in 2003. 2006 SEMA concepts",

The S40 was more or less positioned against premium-leaning small family cars like the Volkswagen Jetta , as well as some mass-market large family cars . The first generation (1995–2004) was introduced in 1995 with the S40 (S from saloon) and V40 (V from versatility, estate) cars. The second generation was released in 2003, and the estate variant became differentiated from the sedan, having its name changed to V50 . The range was replaced by the Volvo V40 five door hatchback in 2012. First generation (1995–2004) During August 1995, Volvo released its new series, intending to call the cars S4 and F4. However, as Audi had already reserved the \"S4\" name, Volvo opted to name the range S40 (saloon), and V40 (estate). These cars were manufactured at the Nedcar factory at Born in the Netherlands (a pre Ford joint venture between Volvo and Mitsubishi Motors ) and based on a common platform with the Mitsubishi Carisma , later used by the Proton Waja . They were also the last Volvos to be produced at the Born plant; a lineage that",

The closest replacements in Volvo's lineup at the time were the V40 (introduced in 2012), along with the existing S60 and V60. With this strategy, Volvo aimed to streamline its lineup and compete more directly with manufacturers such as BMW , Audi , and Mercedes-Benz . In 2016, Volvo presented the Concept 40.1 (SUV) and 40.2 (sedan) as previews of a future 40-series. These concepts hinted at a potential successor to the S40 and V50.
