The Simpsons Castellaneta is most famous for his roles on the longest-running American animated television show, The Simpsons , most notably as Homer Simpson . The Tracey Ullman Show included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family . Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers asked Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge Simpson respectively, rather than hire more actors. Homer's voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau , but Castellaneta could not \"get enough power behind that voice\" and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour recording sessions. He tried to find something easier, so he \"dropped the voice down\", and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest, and is said to \"let his IQ go.\" Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it. Despite Homer's fame, Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, \"except, maybe, by a die-hard fan.\" Castellaneta with fellow Simpsons voice actors Nancy Cartwright , Yeardley Smith and Julie Kavner in 2009",

In the season seven (1995) episode \" Treehouse of Horror VI \", Bart, alongside Homer, was rendered as a three-dimensional character for the first time in the \"Homer 3 \" segment of the episode. The computer animation was provided by Pacific Data Images . In the final minute of the segment, the three-dimensional Homer transitions into a live-action setting, finding himself in real-world Los Angeles. Directed by David Mirkin , this marked the first instance of a Simpsons character appearing in the real world within the series. In \" Lisa's Wedding \" ( season six , 1995), which is set fifteen years in the future, Homer's design was modified to reflect his older age. Changes included increased weight, the removal of one hair from the top of his head, and the addition of an extra line under his eye.
