She also describes how, in the same months that he wrote warm letters to the now-jailed MacDonald, he was also writing to his editor Morgan Entrekin , discussing the technical problem of not spoiling his work's effect by making MacDonald, in the book, appear \"too loathsome too soon.\" Throughout the years of interviews, as Malcolm writes, \"MacDonald imagined he was 'helping' McGinniss write a book exonerating him of his crime.\" What she terms MacDonald's \"dehoaxing\" took place in \"a particularly dramatic and cruel manner\"—a 1983 taping of the CBS news program 60 Minutes . As host Mike Wallace read aloud portions of the now-completed Fatal Vision , the cameras broadcast MacDonald's look of \"shock and utter discomposure.\" Pathological narcissists and auto-fictionalizers In the published Fatal Vision , McGinniss depicted MacDonald as a \"womanizer\" and a \"publicity-seeker\", as well as a sociopath who, unbalanced by amphetamines , had murdered his family. But to Malcolm, MacDonald in person seemed sturdy and unremarkable. McGinniss drew upon the works of a number of social critics, including the moralist Christopher Lasch , to construct a portrait of MacDonald as a \"pathological narcissist.\" But as presented by Malcolm, what drove",

Like the credulous widow who wakes up one day to find the charming young man and all her savings gone, so the consenting subject of a piece of nonfiction learns—when the article or book appears— his hard lesson. Journalists justify their treachery in various ways according to their temperaments. The more pompous talk about freedom of speech and \"the public's right to know\"; the least talented talk about Art, the seemliest murmur about earning a living. Content Malcolm took as her subject the popular non-fiction writer Joe McGinniss; McGinniss had become a best-selling author with his 1969 work The Selling of the President 1968 . After McGinniss interviewed the accused murderer Jeffrey MacDonald, MacDonald proposed that McGinniss write a book of his story and asked for a share of the revenue from the book as a way to fund his legal battle. McGinniss agreed. Having received a sizable advance payment for the true crime project that would become Fatal Vision , McGinniss struck up a close friendship with MacDonald. Later, to assuage the uneasiness of other members at the defense table, lead counsel Bernard Segal had McGinniss sign a contract under terms that McGinniss would not divulge defense strategy to outsiders and would put a positive spin on MacDonald's story.",

      "text": "The Journalist and the Murderer is a study by Janet Malcolm about the ethics of journalism , published by Alfred A. Knopf / Random House in 1990. It is an examination of the professional choices that shape a work of non-fiction, as well as a rumination on the morality that underpins the journalistic enterprise. The journalist in question is Joe McGinniss ; the murderer is the former Special Forces captain Dr. Jeffrey R. MacDonald , who became the subject of McGinniss's 1983 book Fatal Vision . When Malcolm's work first appeared in March 1989, as a two-part serialization in The New Yorker , it caused a sensation, becoming the occasion for wide-ranging debate within the news industry. This heavy criticism continued when published in book form a year later. However, The Journalist and the Murderer is now regarded as a \"seminal\" work, and its \"once controversial theory became received wisdom.\" It ranks 97th on the Modern Library 's list of the 100 best non-fiction works of the 20th century.\" Themes Malcolm's thesis, and the most widely quoted passage from The Journalist and the Murderer , is its opening paragraph: \"Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.\" She continues: He is a kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance or loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them",

An evidentiary hearing relating to the claims within the Britt affidavit, the hair and fiber evidence, and further testimony pertaining to Stoeckley's verbal confessions, was held in September 2012. However, in July 2014, Judge Fox ruled against MacDonald's appeal, upholding his convictions. Fatal Vision In June 1979, MacDonald invited author Joe McGinniss to write a book about his case. Initially unsure of MacDonald's guilt or innocence, McGinniss agreed to his request, and was given full access to MacDonald and his defense team during the upcoming trial. The book McGinniss wrote relating to the murders, Fatal Vision , portrays MacDonald as \"a narcissistic sociopath \" who was guilty of murdering his family and who believed in his ongoing capabilities to deceive both legal personnel and personal acquaintances. McGinniss quotes a 1979 report compiled by a psychologist named Hirsch Lazzaar Silverman, who stated MacDonald \"handled his conflicts by denying that they even exist\", adding that MacDonald lacked any sense of guilt, had been capable of committing \"asocial acts with impunity\", and had been \"incapable of [forming] emotionally close\" relationships with females of any age. Silverman further states MacDonald had avoided and resented his commitments as a husband and father and that, given his ongoing \"denial of truth\", he would continually seek both attention",

In a final address to the jury, Judge Dupree informed the panel they had three choices to choose from: To find MacDonald not guilty; to find him guilty of first-degree murder ; or guilty of second-degree murder in each case. Conviction and incarceration Shortly after 4:00 p.m. on August 29, 1979, the jury, having deliberated for six-and-a-half hours, announced they had reached their verdict. MacDonald was convicted of one count of first-degree murder in the death of Kristen and two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of Colette and Kimberley. Four jurors wept as they announced their verdicts, and MacDonald's mother rushed out of the courtroom wailing. MacDonald himself displayed practically no emotion. Judge Dupree imposed a life sentence for each of the three murders, to be served consecutively. Bail was revoked, and MacDonald was temporarily transferred to a Butner County jail, prior to his permanent transferral to the Federal Correctional Institution in Terminal Island , California.
