Musical style Along with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers , the Yardbirds were part of the British blues scene of the 1960s. As the blues rock genre developed, some acts like Chicken Shack were playing a louder and more aggressive style, while the Yardbirds emphasized instrumental textures and extended instrumental improvisations. They covered blues classics like Howlin' Wolf 's \" Smokestack Lightning \" (1956) and Bo Diddley 's 1955 \" I'm a Man \" which had a repetitive structure where instrumental solos were brief breaks between repetition of verses. The Yardbirds often extended these instrumental sections into \"heavy jams\".

Bo Diddley was honored by the Mississippi Blues Commission with a Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker placed in McComb , his birthplace, in recognition of his enormous contribution to the development of the blues in Mississippi. On June 5, 2009, the city of Gainesville, Florida, officially renamed and dedicated its downtown plaza the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. The plaza was the site of a benefit concert at which Bo Diddley performed to raise awareness about the plight of the homeless in Alachua County and to raise money for local charities, including the Red Cross . Beat The \"Bo Diddley beat\" is essentially the clave rhythm , one of the most common bell patterns found in sub-Saharan African music traditions . One scholar found this rhythm in 13 rhythm and blues recordings made in the years 1944–55, including two by Johnny Otis from 1948. Bo Diddley gave different accounts of how he began to use this rhythm. Ned Sublette says, \"In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], 'Bo Diddley' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'Rhumba' on the track sheets.\" The Bo Diddley beat is similar to \"",

Soon after Clapton joined John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers , Jeff Beck replaced him. The band first approached Jimmy Page, but content with his lucrative sessions work, and worried about both his health and the politics of Clapton's departure, Page recommended his friend Jeff Beck. Beck played his first gig with the Yardbirds two days after Clapton's departure. Beck line-up (1965–1966) The Yardbirds in 1965. Clockwise from top: Jeff Beck, Paul Samwell-Smith, Chris Dreja, Jim McCarty, Keith Relf. Beck's exploration of fuzz tone, reverb, feedback, sustain, distortion, and hammer-on soloing fitted well into the increasingly raw style of British beat music. The Yardbirds began to experiment with eclectic arrangements reminiscent of Gregorian chants and various European and Asian styles while Beck infused a pervasive Middle Eastern influence into the mix. Beck was voted No. 1 lead guitarist of 1966 in the British music magazine Beat Instrumental . The Beck-era Yardbirds produced many groundbreaking recordings, including the hit singles \" Heart Full of Soul \", \" Evil Hearted You \"/\"Still I'm Sad\", a cover of Bo Diddley's \" I'm a Man \" (US only), \" Shapes of Things \", and \" Over Under Sideways Down \", and the Yardbirds album",

      "text": "the story was that upon seeing \"Bo Diddley\" on the cue card, he thought he was to perform both his self-titled hit single and \"Sixteen Tons\". Sullivan was furious and banned Diddley from his show, reputedly saying that he would not last six months. Chess Records included Diddley's cover of \"Sixteen Tons\" on the 1963 album Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger . Diddley's hit singles continued in the 1950s and 1960s: \" Pretty Thing \" (1956), \" Say Man \" (1959), and \" You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover \" (1962). He also released numerous albums, including Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger and Have Guitar, Will Travel . These bolstered his self-invented legend. Between 1958 and 1963, Checker Records released eleven full-length Bo Diddley albums. In the 1960s, he broke through as a crossover artist with white audiences (appearing at the Alan Freed concerts, for example), but he rarely aimed his compositions at teenagers. Diddley was among those musicians who capitalized on the mid-1960s surfing and beach party craze in the United States, and released the albums Surfin' with Bo Diddley and Bo Diddley's Beach Party . These featured heavy, distorted blues, played on his Gretsch guitar with bended notes and minor key",
