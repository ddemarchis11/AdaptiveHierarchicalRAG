Bach's Bourrée , “Funky Town”, and two instrumental songs (untitled). This band came to an end when decided to create a punk band with more serious music. That is how Tappi Tíkarrass came into being by September 1981 with vocalist Eyþór Arnalds , who was replaced a few months later by Björk and a year later, Oddur was replaced in drums by Guðmundur Þór Gunnarsson. The name Tappi Tíkarrass, which in Icelandic means “Cork the Bitch’s Ass” was given after Jakob’s father claimed that the band’s music “fitted like a cork in a bitch’s ass”. Tappi Tíkarrass combined elements of punk and pop music to create an exotic post punk with references to Siouxsie and the Banshees and the first stage of The Cure .

Originally called the Farriss Brothers , founding members were bassist Garry Gary Beers , main composer and keyboardist Andrew Farriss , drummer Jon Farriss , guitarist Tim Farriss , lead singer and main lyricist Michael Hutchence , and guitarist and saxophonist Kirk Pengilly . For 20 years, INXS were fronted by Hutchence, whose stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their new wave /ska-pop style, the band then developed a harder pub rock style that included funk and dance elements. In 1984, INXS had their first number-one hit in Australia with \" Original Sin \". The band achieved international success in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s with the hit albums Listen Like Thieves , Kick , and X , and the singles \" What You Need \", \" Need You Tonight \" (the band's only US number-one single), \" Devil Inside \", \" Never Tear Us Apart \", \" Suicide Blonde \" and \" New Sensation \". After Hutchence's death on 22 November 1997, INXS made appearances with several guest singers, and toured and recorded with Jon Stevens as lead singer, beginning in 2000. In 2005, members of INXS participated in Rock Star: INXS , a reality television series that culminated in",
