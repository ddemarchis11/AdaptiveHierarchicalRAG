      "text": "Bruno Richard Hauptmann (November 26, 1899 – April 3, 1936) was a German-American carpenter and criminal who was convicted of the abduction and murder of Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., the 20-month-old son of aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh . The Lindbergh kidnapping became known as the \" crime of the century \". He was executed in 1936 by electric chair at the Trenton State Prison . Both Hauptmann and his wife, Anna Hauptmann, proclaimed his innocence. In recent years, Hauptmann's guilt has been questioned by authors and researchers, and law enforcement behavior in the case has been widely criticized. Background Bruno Richard Hauptmann was born on November 26, 1899, in Kamenz , a town near Dresden in the Kingdom of Saxony , which was a state of the German Empire . He was the youngest of five children. Neither Hauptmann nor his family or friends used the name Bruno, although prosecutors in the Lindbergh kidnapping trial insisted on referring to him by that name. At age 11, Hauptmann joined the Boy Scouts ( Pfadfinderbund ). He attended public school during the day while attending trade school ( Gewerbeschule ) at night, studying carpentry for the first year, then switching to machine building ( Maschinenschlosser ) for the next two years. Hauptmann's father died in 1917. That same",

      "text": "Cordelia Botkin (1854 – March 7, 1910) was an American murderer who sent a box of poisoned candy to her ex-lover's wife. This was the first American prosecution for a crime which took place in two different jurisdictions, as Botkin had sent the poison from California, but it was received in Delaware. Background Botkin was born in Polk County, Missouri in 1854. She later moved with her family to California , where she married her husband, Welcome Botkin. They were the parents of one son. In 1895, Botkin met John Preston Dunning while he was bicycling in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park . At the time she was 41 years old, nine years his senior. Both of them were married, but Dunning was smitten with her. Dunning was a highly regarded reporter for the Associated Press , having completed overseas assignments in Samoa and Chile. He had been promoted to superintendent of the Associated Press's Western Division bureau in San Francisco. In 1896, Dunning's wife, Mary Elizabeth (Penington) Dunning, upset by her husband's marital indiscretions, left him and returned with their daughter to Dover, Delaware , to the home of her father, former Congressman John B. Penington . By then Botkin had become Dunning's lover and constant companion. Botkin was estranged from her own husband, a grain broker in Stockton, California , but he supported her",

      "text": "Old Smokey is a euphemistic name given to the state prison electric chair in New Jersey , Pennsylvania and Tennessee . The term has sometimes been used to refer to electric chairs in general, and not the one used in any specific state. New Jersey New Jersey's Old Smokey is on display at the New Jersey State Police Museum . The chair's most notorious target was Richard Hauptmann , the man behind the Lindbergh kidnapping . The chair at the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton was used in the electrocution of 159 men for capital punishment in New Jersey , starting with Saverio DiGiovanni on December 11, 1907, and ending with Ralph Hudson on January 22, 1963, which also was the final execution carried out in New Jersey. Hauptmann was executed on April 3, 1936. After the death penalty was abolished nationwide in 1972 following Furman v. Georgia , the chair was moved to storage and the chamber was converted to a visitor center. In the 1980s, the chair was put on exhibit at the now-defunct Capital Punishment Museum, housed in a building at the New Jersey State Corrections Academy; after its curator died in 1995, the chair was sent to the New Jersey State Museum and later was transferred to the New Jersey State Police Museum in Ewing Township , where it remains on display.

      "text": "he was not seriously injured. Although Costello refused to cooperate with police, Gigante was arrested for attempted murder . He was acquitted at trial, thanking Costello in the courtroom after the verdict. Costello was allowed to retire after conceding control of what is today called the Genovese crime family to Genovese. Luciano was powerless to stop these events. On October 25, 1957, Genovese and Gambino successfully arranged the murder of Anastasia, another Luciano ally. The following month, Genovese called a meeting of bosses in Apalachin, New York , to approve his takeover of the Genovese family and to establish his national power. Instead, the Apalachin Meeting turned into a fiasco when law enforcement became aware of the meeting and conducted a raid. Over 65 high-ranking mobsters were arrested, and the Mafia was subjected to publicity and numerous grand jury summonses . The enraged mobsters blamed Genovese for the disaster, opening a window of opportunity for Genovese's opponents. Luciano allegedly attended a meeting at a hotel in Palermo to discuss heroin trade as part of the French Connection . After this meeting, Luciano allegedly helped pay part of $100,000 to a Puerto Rican drug dealer to falsely implicate Genovese in a drug deal. On April 4, 1959, Genovese was convicted in New York of conspiracy to violate federal narcotics laws. Sent to prison for fifteen years,",

Experts retained by the defense were never called to testify. The trial began on January 3, 1935 and lasted until February 13. During the trial, Hauptmann was identified as the man who received the ransom money, the man who had spent some of the ransom gold certificates, and as a man seen near the Lindbergh home on the day of the kidnapping. He had been absent from work on the day of the ransom payment and had quit his job two days later.  Hauptmann's attorney, Edward J. Reilly, argued that the evidence against Hauptmann was entirely circumstantial, as no reliable witness had placed Hauptmann at the scene of the crime, nor were his fingerprints found on the ladder, the ransom notes, or anywhere in the nursery. However, Hauptmann was convicted and immediately sentenced to death. His appeals failed, though his execution was stayed twice while New Jersey Governor Harold G. Hoffman reviewed the case. Execution On April 3, 1936, Hauptmann was executed in the electric chair at the New Jersey State Prison . Reporters present said that he made no statement.
