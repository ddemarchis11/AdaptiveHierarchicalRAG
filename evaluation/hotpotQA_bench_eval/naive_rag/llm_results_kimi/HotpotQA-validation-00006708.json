      "text": "Vibe is an American music and entertainment magazine founded by producers David Salzman and Quincy Jones . The publication predominantly features R&B and hip hop music artists, actors and other entertainers. After shutting down production in the summer of 2009, it was purchased by the private equity investment fund InterMedia Partners , then issued bi-monthly with double covers and a larger online presence. The magazine's target demographic is predominantly young, urban followers of hip hop culture. In 2014, the magazine discontinued its print version. The magazine features a broader range of interests than its closest competitors The Source and XXL , which focus more narrowly on rap music, or the rock- and pop-centric Rolling Stone and Spin . The May 1998 Vibe article \"Racer X\" by Ken Li is credited as the basis for the 2001 film The Fast and the Furious and the resulting franchise . Publication history Quincy Jones launched Vibe in 1993, in partnership with Time Inc. Originally, the publication was called Volume before co-founding editor, Scott Poulson-Bryant named it Vibe . Vibe was initially \"founded with a test issue in 1992 by Time Warner.\"  Though hip hop mogul Russell Simmons was rumored to be an initial partner, publisher Len Burnett revealed in a March 2007 interview that Simmons clashed with editor-in-chief Jonathan Van Meter. In May 1994, Meter resigned after Jones prevented the publication of the June/July 1994 issue",

She was only 15 at the time of its release—the original video has since been deleted. Over the next few years, she continued to release original music, as well as freestyles using beats from other artists through her YouTube channel, where she has amassed over 1.2 million subscribers. In October 2015, the official music video for her song \"Vagina\" was released on YouTube via YMCFilmz.

One month later, Harris released \"Deepthroat\" on her own channel. Within weeks, the two videos went viral on YouTube, Worldstar, and Facebook . The songs later became singles for Harris' debut mixtape, Cum Cake , which was released in February 2016.
