He is in love with Vera, the daughter of a wealthy landowner, Lagutin. However, Vera’s hand is also sought by Prince Kurakin. Amid these personal dramas, the Narodnaya Volya revolutionaries detonate a bomb targeting the tsar’s carriage, prompting a crackdown on those suspected of opposing the monarchy.
