  "question": "What region has the indigenous language that includes the word Catuaba?",
  "gold_answer": "South America",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence states that the name “Catuaba … ultimately [comes] from Guarani,” and that Guarani is “a language of South America” spoken especially in Paraguay and adjacent parts of Brazil. Therefore, the region whose indigenous language includes the word Catuaba is South America (specifically the Guarani-speaking areas of Paraguay and Brazil).",

      "text": "A Guarani speaker Paraguayan Guarani , or simply Guarani ( avañe'ẽ ), is a language of South America that belongs to the Tupi–Guarani branch of the Tupian language family . It is one of the two official languages of Paraguay (along with Spanish ), where it is spoken by the majority of the population, and where half of the rural population are monolingual speakers of the language. Variants of the language are spoken by communities in neighboring countries including parts of northeastern Argentina , southeastern Bolivia and southwestern Brazil . It is a second official language of the Argentine province of Corrientes since 2004 and the Brazilian city of Tacuru since 2010. Guarani is also one of the three official languages of Mercosur , alongside Spanish and Portuguese . Guarani is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages and remains commonly used among the Paraguayan people and neighboring communities. This is unique among American languages; language shift towards European colonial languages (in this case, the other official language of Spanish ) has otherwise been a nearly universal phenomenon in the Western Hemisphere , but Paraguayans have maintained their traditional language while also adopting Spanish. The name \"Guarani\" is generally used for the official language of Paraguay. However, this is part of a dialect chain , most of whose components are also often called Guarani.

      "text": "The Cabécar language is an indigenous American language of the Chibchan language family spoken by the Cabécar people in the inland Turrialba Region , Cartago Province , Costa Rica . As of 2007, 2,000 speakers were monolingual. It is the only indigenous language in Costa Rica with monolingual adults. The language is also known by its dialect names Chirripó, Estrella, Telire, and Ujarrás. History Cabécar is considered to be one of a few \"Chibcha-speaking tribes\", categorized by similarities in the languages that they speak. Other Chibcha speaking tribes include the Bribri and the Boruca , also of Costa Rica. It is believed that the languages of the Chibcha speaking tribes shared a common ancestor around 8,000 years ago. However, differences in the languages are thought to have come about from the influence of outside people, including influences from Mesoamerica . Geographic distribution Cabécar is an endangered language spoken in Costa Rica. It is spoken by the Cabécar people , an indigenous group located near the Talamancan mountains of Costa Rica. Dialects and varieties There are two different dialects of Cabécar, each of which has more narrow dialects within it. One of these is spoken in the north, while the other is spoken in southern parts of Costa Rica. Phonology Cabécar uses a Latin alphabet with umlauts",

Following the out-migration from the reductions, these two distinct dialects of Guarani came into extensive contact for the first time. The vast majority of speakers abandoned the less colloquial, highly regulated Jesuit variant in favor of the variety that evolved from actual use by speakers in Paraguay. This contemporary form of spoken Guarani is known as Jopará , meaning \"mixture\" in Guarani.  Political status A government sign in Asunción , Paraguay; bilingual in Guarani and Spanish Widely spoken, Paraguayan Guarani has nevertheless been repressed by Paraguayan governments throughout most of its history since independence. It was prohibited in state schools for over 100 years. However, populists often used pride in the language to excite nationalistic fervor and promote a narrative of social unity.  During the autocratic regime of Alfredo Stroessner , his Colorado Party used the language to appeal to common Paraguayans although Stroessner himself never gave an address in Guarani. Upon the advent of Paraguayan democracy in 1992, Guarani was established in the new constitution as a language equal to Spanish.

      "text": "of whose components are also often called Guarani.  History While Guarani, in its Classical form , was the only language spoken in the expansive missionary territories, Paraguayan Guarani has its roots outside of the Jesuit Reductions .  Modern scholarship has shown that Guarani was always the primary language of colonial Paraguay, both inside and outside the reductions. Following the expulsion of the Jesuits in the 18th century, the residents of the reductions gradually migrated north and west towards Asunción , a demographic shift that brought about a decidedly one-sided shift away from the Jesuit dialect that the missionaries had curated in the southern and eastern territories of the colony. By and large, the Guarani of the Jesuits shied away from direct phonological loans from Spanish. Instead, the missionaries relied on the agglutinative nature of the language to formulate new precise translations or calque terms from Guarani morphemes. This process often led the Jesuits to employ complicated, highly synthetic terms to convey European concepts. By contrast, the Guarani spoken outside of the missions was characterized by a free, unregulated flow of Hispanicisms; frequently, Spanish words and phrases were simply incorporated into Guarani with minimal phonological adaptation.  A good example of that phenomenon is found in the word \"communion\". The Jesuits, using their agglutinative strategy, rendered this word \" Tupârahava \", a calque based on the word \" Tupâ \", meaning God.",

The most widely used barks are derived from the trees Trichilia catigua and Erythroxylum vaccinifolium . Other catuaba preparations use the bark of trees from the following genera or families: Anemopaegma , Ilex , Micropholis , Phyllanthus , Secondatia , Tetragastris and species from the Myrtaceae . Local synonyms are Chuchuhuasha, Tatuaba, Pau de Reposta, Piratancara and Caramuru. It is often claimed that catuaba is derived from the tree Erythroxylum catuaba , but this tree has been described only once, in 1904, and it is not known today to what tree this name referred. E. catuaba is therefore not a recognised species. Uses A commercial liquid preparation, Catuama, contains multiple ingredients, one of these being catuaba from Trichilia catigua (28.23%), in addition to Guarana (40.31%), Ptychopetalum olacoides",

According to Espinoza Romero, Mejía Marín & Ovares Barquero 2011, the school, traditionally an acculturation mechanism, has not contributed to strengthening the Maléku identity. For instance, students receive instruction of core subjects in Spanish. They have to learn how to read and write in Spanish first. When they already read and write in the mainstream language, they can learn their language. The authors claim that the norm has been the teaching of the official language: Spanish and that despite the existence of educational policies that contemplate the revitalization of the use of indigenous languages in the region, there is an absence of strategies for teaching aboriginal languages. Dialects The speakers of these three communities have declared that there are differences between the variety spoken by the communities of Margarita and El Sol and the one that is spoken by the people of Tonjibe (Avendaño 2018). Corobicí may have been a dialect. Documentation As pointed out by Constenla 1998:3, little documentation of Maléku was recorded before the latter half of the 19th century. All records from that period are included in Walter Lehmann 's 1920 volume on Central American languages. The first scholar modern linguist to deeply study the Maléku language, aside from sources reproduced by Lehmann, was Adolfo Constenla Umaña , in collaboration with many members of the Maléku",
