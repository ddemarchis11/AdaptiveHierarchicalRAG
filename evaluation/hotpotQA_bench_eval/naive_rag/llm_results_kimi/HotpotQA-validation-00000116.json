Suicide entered the studio with much of their songs already written and rehearsed from having spent the previous five years playing shows. The recording of the album was done in four days. Leon had previously worked with reggae musicians Bob Marley and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and seen them create dub-like effects with their music and used an Eventide digital delay unit to create these echo effects on the album's vocal tracks. Leon returned to California after four days of work which led to Marty Thau to work on the rest of the production. Alan Vega changed the lyrics of \" Frankie Teardrop \" during the mixing sessions of the album. Thau remixed the tracks \" Ghost Rider \", \"Rocket U.S.A.\" and \" Cheree \". Leon returned to New York where the two remixed \"Frankie Teardrop\". The album was mastered at Frankford/Wayne in New York. Style Musically, Suicide has been described as synth-punk , electronic rock , and synth-pop , while also being labeled electronic and minimalist . All the songs on the album have a \"stripped down\" sound with Martin Rev providing a backing combining \"harshly hypnotic organs\" and \"dense, unnerving electronics\". The vocals on the album provided by Alan Vega have been described as similar to Gene Vincent . In 2012, Vega stated that",
