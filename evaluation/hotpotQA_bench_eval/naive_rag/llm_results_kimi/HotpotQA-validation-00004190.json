Production Ruben Fleischer at the film's premiere Writing Writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick stated that the idea for Zombieland had \"lived in [their] heads\" for four-and-a-half years. The story was originally developed as a spec script for a television pilot in the summer of 2005. Wernick stated, \"We've got a long brainstorming document that still to this day gets updated on a near-weekly basis with ideas\". Director Ruben Fleischer helped develop the script from a series into a self-contained feature by providing a specific destination to the road story, the amusement park. Earlier versions of the script called the protagonists Flagstaff and Albuquerque, rather than Columbus and Tallahassee, and the female characters were called Wichita and Stillwater. Casting Woody Harrelson accepted the role on four conditions, two of which were about casting and crew. The third condition required the film to have an environmentally conscious set. The fourth condition required that the director will not eat dairy products for a week, a task that Fleischer described as \"like for an alcoholic not to drink\". He succeeded and maintained a vegetarian diet for 11 months. The cameo role was originally written for Patrick Swayze , as a zombified, dancing character, including references to highlights of Swayze's career, even including a recreation of the potter's wheel scene from Ghost . However, Swayze was battling pancreatic",

While declaring that Sleepless in Seattle remains the best romantic comedy ever released, Body+Soul contributor Hannah-Rose Yee said despite being \"the kind of movie that gives romantic comedies a bad name ... no film has come close to distilling what Sleepless in Seattle does about the ridiculous enterprise that is opening up your heart to someone else\". However, she admitted that one's ability to enjoy the film depends \"entirely on how on board you can get with a romance in which the two lead characters don't meet until the last five minutes\". The Guardian 's Luke Walpole, who had avoided watching the film until 2020 in fear that it had aged poorly, ultimately found Ephron's screenplay to be a gorgeous \"balance of melancholy and fizzing optimism\", but criticized Sleepless in Seattle' s \"narrowly middle class and privileged\" characters. Common Sense Media wrote that the film is successful in Ephron's hands, despite its \"frustrating\" structure at times. Siede noted that in recent years, Annie's actions in pursuit of Sam have been re-evaluated as what some critics perceive as stalker behavior, with Nicole Sperling of Vanity Fair feeling Annie's determination \"verges into stalker territory\". Siede defended the character, writing \"Annie's",
