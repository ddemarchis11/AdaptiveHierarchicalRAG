Moreover, the two women attempted to film an additional video of Lee Byung-hun hugging Lee Ji-yeon by secretly placing a smartphone in a kitchen sink, but they failed to do so. However, Lee Ji-yeon claimed that the blackmailing was an impulsive act after Lee broke up with her, for which Lee's agency released an official statement, stating that Lee had not once met her alone and that he mentioned to the two women that he wanted to stop meeting them when he sensed ulterior motives from them, after talking about their financial difficulties, demanding he buy them a house. The final trial was held at the Seoul District Court on January 15, 2015, where Dahee was sentenced to a year in jail and Lee Ji-yeon a year and two months. In February, following the sentencing, Lee Byung-hun requested a pardon for the women, while the prosecutors in charge felt that the sentence was too lenient. In March, both women, who were in jail for six months, received a suspended sentence for two years, following Lee's pardon request. Glam was disbanded following the sentencing of Dahee.
