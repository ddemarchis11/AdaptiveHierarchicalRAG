These experiences inspired Byron to write political poems such as Song for the Luddites (1816) and The Landlords' Interest , Canto XIV of The Age of Bronze . Examples of poems in which he attacked his political opponents include Wellington : The Best of the Cut-Throats (1819) and The Intellectual Eunuch Castlereagh (1818). Poetic works Byron wrote prolifically. In 1832 his regular publisher, John Murray, released the complete works in 14 duodecimo volumes, including a life by Thomas Moore . Subsequent editions were released in 17 volumes, first published in 1833. An extensive collection of his works, including early editions and annotated manuscripts, is held within the John Murray Archive at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh. Don Juan Byron's magnum opus , Don Juan , a poem spanning 17 cantos, ranks as one of the most important long poems published in England since John Milton 's Paradise Lost . Byron published the first two cantos anonymously in 1819 after disputes with his regular publisher over the shocking nature of the poetry. By this time, he had been a famous poet for seven years, and when he self-published the beginning cantos, they were well received in some quarters. The poem was then released volume by volume through his regular publishing house. By 1822, cautious acceptance by the public had turned to outrage, and",

      "text": "Glenarvon was Lady Caroline Lamb 's first novel. It created a sensation when published on 9 May 1816. Set in the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , the book satirized the Whig Holland House circle, while casting a sceptical eye on left-wing politics . Its rakish title character, Lord Glenarvon, is an unflattering depiction of her ex-lover, Lord Byron . In 1866, it was reprinted under the title, The Fatal Passion. Theme Glenarvon corrupts the innocent young bride Calantha (Caroline herself), leading to their mutual ruin and death. The picture of her husband, William Lamb (the 2nd Viscount Melbourne from 1828), called Lord Avondale in the book, is more favourable, although he too is held to be partly responsible for Calantha's misfortunes: his biographer remarks that the book's message is that Caroline's troubles are everybody else's fault. The book is full of wildly improbable melodramatic scenes: Calantha's infant brother, the heir to a dukedom, is apparently murdered on the orders of their aunt Lady Margaret, to ensure that her son will inherit the estates; yet later we are told that the child is still alive. Lady Caroline was unprepared for the negative reaction to Glenarvon . The day after it was published, messages of outrage began to arrive. A second edition softened somewhat the book's sensationalism . Impact The book",

She is shown having a hollowed back and the ability to drive people to suicide.  In 1877, Swedish poet Viktor Rydberg published a poem titled \"Skogsrået.\" Between 1894 and 1895, Finnish composer Jean Sibelius composed a tone poem based on Rydberg's poem bearing the same title . French Nordic folk group Skáld adapted Rydberg's poem for their 2022 single \"Då Månen Sken.\" In the game Unforgiving: A Northern Hymn , a skogsrå roams the forest where she bites her victims and turns them into trees. Eventually Linn encounters the forest spirit and gets bitten. However, she manages to be free of the infection with the help of the Näcken . In the video game Bramble: The Mountain King , a skogsrå appears as a boss. Skogsra appears as a demon in multiple games of the Shin Megami Tensei series.

Impact The book was an enormous success with the reading public, but ruined Lamb's already questionable reputation. Society's leaders did not greatly mind reading about her love affairs, but they deeply resented the vicious and easily recognisable portraits of themselves in the book, which were its chief selling point. One of those thus satirised, Lady Jersey , took her revenge by barring Lamb from Almack's , the centre of fashionable life, a sign that she was socially an outcast. A Melbourne biographer remarked that Lamb never found her way back into society again. Queen Victoria acquired a copy in September 1841, the day after her last official dispatch from former Prime Minister and close friend Lord Melbourne , who was alluded to in the form of the character Lord Avondale. Literary echoes The title character's full name is Clarence de Ruthven. John Polidori used a vampire named Lord Ruthven as a characterization of Lord Byron in his short story \" The Vampyre \" published in 1819. In the Regency novel Bath Tangle , by Georgette Heyer , the heroine is sent a copy of Glenarvon , which she pronounces both \"the most diverting book that ever was written\" and \"the most absurd farrago of nonsense\". After some banter about whether she is herself an innocent Calantha, a partial",

As one of the first English women to earn her living by her writing, she broke cultural barriers and served as a literary role model for later generations of women authors. Rising from obscurity, she came to the notice of Charles II , who employed her as a spy in Antwerp . Upon her return to London and a probable brief stay in debtors' prison , she began writing for the stage. She belonged to a coterie of poets and famous libertines such as John Wilmot, Lord Rochester . Behn wrote under the pastoral pseudonym Astrea . During the turbulent political times of the Exclusion Crisis , she wrote an epilogue and prologue that brought her legal trouble; she thereafter devoted most of her writing to prose genres and translations. A staunch supporter of the Stuart line, Behn declined an invitation from Bishop Burnet to write a welcoming poem to the new king William III . She died shortly after. She is remembered in Virginia Woolf 's A Room of One's Own : \"All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn which is, most scandalously but rather appropriately, in Westminster Abbey , for it was she who earned them the right to speak their",

They had a daughter, Augusta Ada . On 16 January 1816, Lady Byron left her husband, taking Ada with her. That same year on 21 April, Byron signed the Deed of Separation. Rumours of marital violence, adultery with actresses, incest with Augusta Leigh, and sodomy were circulated, assisted by a jealous Lady Caroline. In a letter, Augusta quoted him as saying: \"Even to have such a thing said is utter destruction and ruin to a man from which he can never recover.\" That same year Lady Caroline published her popular novel Glenarvon , in which Lord Byron was portrayed as the seedy title character. Sexuality Byron described his first intense romantic feelings at the age of seven for his distant cousin Mary Duff: My mother used always to rally me about this childish amour, and at last, many years after, when I was sixteen, she told me one day, 'O Byron, I have had a letter from Edinburgh, and your old sweetheart, Mary Duff, is married to Mr. C***.'
