As I've said before, one can't sing too solemnly about a jumbuck. But Waltzing Matilda is Australia's song and it always will be.\" Australian passports issued from 2003 have had the lyrics of \"Waltzing Matilda\" hidden microscopically in the background pattern of most of the pages for visas and arrival/departure stamps. Sports \"Waltzing Matilda\" was used at the 1974 FIFA World Cup and, as a response to the New Zealand All Blacks haka , it has gained popularity as a sporting anthem for the Australia national rugby union team .  It would have been played at award ceremonies at the Montreal Olympic Games in 1976 , but Australia received no gold medals. Matilda the Kangaroo was the mascot at the 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane , Queensland. Matilda was a cartoon kangaroo, who appeared as a 13-metre (43 ft) high mechanical kangaroo at the opening ceremony, accompanied by Rolf Harris singing \"Waltzing Matilda\". The Australian women's national soccer team is nicknamed the Matildas after this song. Jessica Mauboy and Stan Walker recorded a version of \"Waltzing Matilda\" to promote the London 2012 Summer Olympics in Australia. It was released as a single on 3",

The team's official nickname is \"the Matildas \" (from the Australian folk song \" Waltzing Matilda \"; officially known as the CommBank Matildas for sponsorship reasons ); they were known as the \"Female Socceroos \" before 1995. Australia is a three-time OFC champion, one-time AFC champion and one-time AFF champion. The team has represented Australia at the FIFA Women's World Cup on eight occasions (once as co-host in 2023 ) and at the Olympic Games on five, although it has won neither tournament. Their performance in the 2023 World Cup attracted significant nationwide attention and has had an impact on the perception of women's sport in Australia . History Foundation The Australian Women's Soccer Association (AWSA) was founded in 1974 and a representative Australian team competed at the 1975 AFC Women's Championship , although the team was comprised primarily from a club in New South Wales, St George Budapest , with some debate as to whether a national selection process was ever conducted. This team was officially recognised by Football Australia in May 2023, with all 16 members of the squad officially awarded caps. Pat",

One of the platinum awards was for Paterson and Cowan's version of \"Waltzing Matilda\". Official use The song has never been the officially recognised national anthem in Australia. However, from 1976 to 1984 it was one of three \"national songs\" that could be used in place of the then national anthem, \" God Save the Queen \" (except for royal or vice-regal events). The Fraser government in 1977 included \"Waltzing Matilda\" in a plebiscite to choose the \"national song\". \"Waltzing Matilda\" received 28% of the vote compared with 43% for \" Advance Australia Fair \", 19% for \"God Save the Queen\" and 10% for \" Song of Australia \". Later the Hawke government advised the declaration of \"Advance Australia Fair\" as the national anthem, without reference to an official \"national song\".
