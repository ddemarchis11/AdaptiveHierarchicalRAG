Early in 1952, in response to the growing need in Belize for higher levels of academic training, St. John's College expanded its traditional four-year high school program, offering a limited number of post-secondary school courses under the direction of Fr. Robert Raszkowski, S.J. This expanded into what in the British tradition is called Sixth Form , a two-year program leading to Advanced Level Examinations (\" A-Levels \") out of Cambridge University in England. In the mid-1960s, in an effort to provide wider opportunities for further education to graduates of the Sixth Form, St. John's College broadened the program of studies so that it met the requirements of the associate degree awarded by junior and community colleges in the United States . It received membership in the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges . This afforded St. John's College Sixth Form graduates a choice of further studies. They could enter Commonwealth universities, which require Cambridge “A Level” certificates, or United States universities as transfer students into the third year of a Bachelor's degree program. Over 200 graduates of Sixth Form have received scholarships from the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States to finish their bachelor's degree tuition-free. Many accepted the offer to remain as teaching fellows and so finished their master's degree.

In the 4th-century-BC Athens, the government of the polis , or city-state, respected the ability of rhetoric or public speaking above almost everything else. Eventually rhetoric, grammar , and dialectic ( logic ) became the educational programme of the trivium . Together they came to be known as the seven liberal arts . Originally these subjects or skills were held by classical antiquity to be essential for a free person ( liberalis , \"worthy of a free person\") to acquire in order to take an active part in civic life, something that included among other things participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and participating in military service. While the arts of the quadrivium might have appeared prior to the arts of the trivium, by the Middle Ages educational programmes taught the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) first while the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy) were the following stage of education. Allegory of the seven liberal arts, The Phoebus Foundation Rooted in the basic curriculum – the eukuklios paideia or \"well-rounded education\" – of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece , the \"liberal arts\" or \"liberal pursuits\" (Latin liberalia studia ) were already called so in formal education during",
