      "text": "Family Matters is an American television sitcom that originally aired on ABC for eight seasons from September 22, 1989, to May 9, 1997, then moved to CBS for its ninth and final season from September 19, 1997, to July 17, 1998. A spin-off of Perfect Strangers , the series was created by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and revolves around the Winslow family, a Black middle class family living in Chicago, Illinois . Midway through the first season, the show introduced the Winslows' nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel ( Jaleel White ), originally as a one-time appearance. However, he quickly became the show's breakout character (and eventually the main character), joining the main cast. Running for 215 episodes over nine seasons, Family Matters is the third-longest-running live action American sitcom with a predominantly African-American cast, behind The Jeffersons with 253 episodes over 11 seasons and Tyler Perry's House of Payne with 355 episodes as of 2023. Family Matters was the last live-action scripted primetime show that debuted in the 1980s to end its run; the only scripted shows that started in the 1980s and have lasted longer in continuous production is The Simpsons and The Bold and the Beautiful .

Jo Marie Payton played Harriette Winslow, the elevator operator at a newspaper where Larry Appleton and Balki Bartokomous also worked. Reginald VelJohnson , who was coming off of growing fame from his role in Die Hard , made an appearance on the show as Harriette's husband Carl Winslow, a Chicago police officer. ABC and the producers loved the character Harriette for her great morale and quick-witted humor and decided to create a show that would focus on her and her family, husband Carl, son Eddie, elder daughter Laura, and younger daughter Judy (who appeared until the character was retconned after season four as having not existed). In the pilot episode , \" The Mama Who Came to Dinner \", the family had also opened their home to Carl's street-wise mother, Estelle ( Rosetta LeNoire ), usually known as \"Mother Winslow\". Prior to the start of the series, Harriette's sister, Rachel Crawford and her infant son, Richie, had moved into the Winslow household after the death of Rachel's husband. The Winslows' nerdy teenage next-door neighbor, Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), was introduced early in the first season, given a significant role midway through the season in the episode \"Laura’s First Date\", and quickly",
