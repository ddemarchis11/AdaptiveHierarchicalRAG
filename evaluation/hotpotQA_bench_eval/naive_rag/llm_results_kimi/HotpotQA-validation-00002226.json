As of 2024, the airport provides commercial passenger service through several major airlines, including American Airlines , Delta Air Lines , and Silver Airways , offering nonstop flights to key hubs such as Atlanta , Charlotte , Dallas/Fort Worth , and Miami . With annual passenger traffic averaging between 850,000 and 900,000, Tallahassee International Airport ranks as one of the smaller commercial airports in Florida, yet remains a crucial transportation hub for the northern part of the state.
