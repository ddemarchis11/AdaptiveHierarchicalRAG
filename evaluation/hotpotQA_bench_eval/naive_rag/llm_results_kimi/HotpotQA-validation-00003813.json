Business ventures In 1960, Brown married Eleanor Bennett Durall and had three children including John Young Brown III , Eleanor Faris, and Sandra Bennett. He got his wife involved in managing a barbecue restaurant; upon seeing its success, he became convinced of the financial potential of the fast food industry. During a 1963 political breakfast, Brown met Colonel Harland Sanders , the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), and the two discussed selling Sanders' chicken in Brown's chain of barbecue restaurants. By 1964, Brown persuaded Jack C. Massey to purchase KFC from Sanders for $ 2 million (equivalent to $20,276,824 in 2024).

Currently operating throughout the island in 15 locations, Chefette is known for its broasted chicken meals as well as a local curried -' meat + vegetable ' (similar to the European gyro ) roll-up or wrap, locally known as a roti . Chefette was founded by a Trinidadian businessman named Assad John Haloute , as well as members of the Naime and Nadur families who migrated to Barbados in the 1970s. In 1972 the trio opened the first Chefette Restaurant at Fontabelle, St. Michael . As the success of the chain grew over the next three decades, the restaurant chain continued its expansion. The company's trademark colours are yellow and purple. Several of the outlets push the theme of being a \"family restaurant\" by constructing play areas for children similar to other major international chains such as McDonald's . Though international restaurant chains (including McDonald's) generally lack an overall presence in Barbados, among Chefette's competitors is U.S. -based KFC . In 2010 Barbadian Senator Kerrie Symmonds lauded the Chefette establishment and urged other businesses in Barbados to emulate it when considering international expansion. Chefette's largest competitors are KFC, Burger King and Chicken Barn. Although relatively unknown outside of Barbados, the chain was recognised in May 2012 as one of the Top Fast Food chains by New York",
