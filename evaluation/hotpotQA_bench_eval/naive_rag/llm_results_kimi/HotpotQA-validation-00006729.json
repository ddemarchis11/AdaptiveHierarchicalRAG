      "text": "The Betsy Ross Bridge is a continuous steel truss bridge spanning the Delaware River from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania to Pennsauken, New Jersey . It was built from 1969 to 1974, and opened in April 1976, during the American Bicentennial Year. It was originally planned to be named as the \" Delair Bridge \", after a paralleling vertical lift bridge owned by Pennsylvania Railroad , which is now used by Conrail Shared Assets Operations and New Jersey Transit 's Atlantic City Line (both bridges NJ terminus are in the Pennsauken neighborhood of Delair), but was instead later named for Betsy Ross , a Philadelphia seamstress and reputed creator of the first American flag in 1776. It was the first automotive bridge named for a woman in the United States, and the second U.S. bridge overall named for a woman after Iowa 's Boone High Bridge was renamed the Kate Shelley High Bridge in 1912. Betsy Ross Bridge is located adjacent to the mouth of Frankford Creek . During construction, thousands of headstones from historic Monument Cemetery were used as riprap on the embankments built for the bridge, some of which can be seen along the edge of the Delaware River near the bridge during low tide.

It is also possible that Weisgerber used a July 1873 issue of Harper's Weekly Magazine as his source to find out what a 1777 flag looked like. This article published one year after Preble's first edition, showed this flag with the label, \"Flag Adopted by Congress, 1777.\" The Betsy Ross House with the flag flying out front Weisgerber later helped start the foundation that restored 239 Arch Street in Philadelphia as the Betsy Ross House , though Ross may have actually lived in the demolished house next door. Weisgerber promoted the story of Betsy Ross by sending prints of the painting to foundation donors. It was reported in 1928 that he received donations from 4 million children and adults. In 1897, the New York City School Board approved the order of framed prints for all schools in their system.
