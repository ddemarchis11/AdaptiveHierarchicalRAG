      "text": "A waveform of white noise plotted on a graph Within ghost hunting and parapsychology , electronic voice phenomena ( EVP ) are sounds found on electronic recordings that are interpreted as spirit voices. Parapsychologist Konstantīns Raudive , who popularized the idea in the 1970s, described EVP as typically brief, usually the length of a word or short phrase. Enthusiasts consider EVP to be a form of paranormal phenomenon often found in recordings with static or other background noise . Scientists regard EVP as a form of auditory pareidolia (interpreting random sounds as voices in one's own language) and a pseudoscience promulgated by popular culture. Prosaic explanations for EVP include apophenia (perceiving patterns in random information), equipment artifacts, and hoaxes. History As the Spiritualist religious movement became prominent in the 1840s–1940s with a distinguishing belief that the spirits of the dead can be contacted by mediums , new technologies of the era, including photography , were employed by spiritualists in an effort to demonstrate contact with a spirit world . So popular were such ideas that Thomas Edison was asked in an interview with Scientific American to comment on the possibility of using his inventions to communicate with spirits. He replied that if the spirits were only capable of subtle influences, a sensitive recording device would provide a better chance of spirit communication than the table tipping and ouija boards mediums employed at the time. However, there is no indication that Edison ever",

Raudive was born in Latgale in eastern Latvia (then part of Vitebsk Governorate ) but studied extensively abroad, later becoming a student of Carl Jung . In exile following the Soviet re-occupation of Latvia in 1944 , he taught at the University of Uppsala in Sweden . Raudive studied parapsychology all his life, and was especially interested in the possibility of the afterlife . He and German parapsychologist Hans Bender investigated electronic voice phenomena (EVP). He published a book on EVP, Breakthrough , in 1971. Raudive was a scientist as well as a practising Roman Catholic . EVP research In 1964, Raudive read Friedrich Jürgenson 's book, Voices from Space , and was so impressed by it that he arranged to meet Jürgenson in 1965. He then worked with Jürgenson to make some EVP recordings, but their first efforts bore little fruit, although they believed that they could hear very weak, muddled voices. According to Raudive, however, one night, as he listened to one recording, he clearly heard",

According to the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, \"An important modern day development in mediumship is spirit communications via an electronic device. This is most commonly known as Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP)\". An informal survey by the organization's Department Of Phenomenal Evidence cites that 1/3 of churches conduct sessions in which participants seek to communicate with spirit entities using EVP. The James Randi Educational Foundation offered a million dollars for proof that any phenomena, including EVP, are caused paranormally. Demographics United States In 2015, an investigation by sociologist Marc Eaton on the demography of United States paranormal groups that used electronic voice phenomenon found an overrepresentation of white participants, raised in the Roman Catholic Church (which is only 21% of the U.S. population), mainly with some post-secondary education. Although a preponderance of research shows that women and \"less socially integrated individuals\" are more likely to believe in ghosts, the demographic samples in Eaton's research did not reflect this. Cultural impact The concept of EVP has influenced popular culture. It is popular as an entertaining pursuit, as in ghost hunting , and as a means of dealing with grief. It has influenced literature, radio, film, television, and music. Groups Investigation of EVP is the subject of hundreds of regional and national groups and Internet message boards. Paranormal investigator John Zaffis claims, \"There's been a boom in ghost hunting ever",

This, in combination with such things as cross modulation of radio stations or faulty ground loops can cause the impression of paranormal voices. The human brain evolved to recognize patterns, and if a person listens to enough noise the brain will detect words, even when there is no intelligent source for them. Expectation also plays an important part in making people believe they are hearing voices in random noise. Apophenia is related to, but distinct from pareidolia. Apophenia is defined as \"the spontaneous finding of connections or meaning in things which are random, unconnected or meaningless\", and has been put forward as a possible explanation. According to the psychologist James Alcock what people hear in EVP recordings can best be explained by apophenia, cross-modulation or expectation and wishful thinking . Alcock concluded \"Electronic Voice Phenomena are the products of hope and expectation; the claims wither away under the light of scientific scrutiny.\" Physics Interference , for example, is seen in EVP recordings, especially those recorded on devices which contain RLC circuitry . These cases represent radio signals of voices or other sounds from broadcast sources. Interference from CB Radio transmissions and wireless baby monitors, or anomalies generated through cross modulation from other electronic devices, are all documented phenomena. It is even possible for circuits to resonate without any internal power source by means of radio reception . Capture errors are anomalies created by the method used to",

Another electronic device specifically constructed in an attempt to capture EVP is \"Frank's Box\" or the \"Ghost Box\", created in 2002 by EVP enthusiast Frank Sumption for supposed real-time communication with the dead. Sumption claims he received his design instructions from the spirit world. The device is described as a combination white noise generator and AM radio receiver modified to sweep back and forth through the AM band selecting split-second snippets of sound. Critics of the device say its effect is subjective and incapable of being replicated, and since it relies on radio noise, any meaningful response a user gets is purely coincidental, or simply the result of pareidolia . Paranormal researcher Ben Radford writes that Frank's Box is a \"modern version of the Ouija board ... also known as the 'broken radio'\". Interest in the 21st century and late 20th century In 1982, Sarah Estep founded the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena (AA-EVP) in Severna Park, Maryland , a nonprofit organization with the purpose of increasing awareness of EVP, and of teaching standardized methods for capturing it. Estep began her exploration of EVP in 1976, and says she has made hundreds of recordings of messages from deceased friends, relatives, and extraterrestrials whom she speculated originated from other planets or dimensions.
