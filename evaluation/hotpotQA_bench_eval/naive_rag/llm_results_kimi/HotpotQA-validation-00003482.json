The band is known for its vocal harmonies, varied instrumentation, and near-exclusive use of only its own band members on recordings instead of session musicians . Their sound was originally defined by mainstream country, bluegrass , and rock influences, but later albums drew more influence from Christian country music and country pop . Beginnings Ty Herndon (seen here in 2009) was an early member of the Grizzly River Boys, who later became Diamond Rio. In 1982, Matt Davenport and Danny Gregg founded a band at Opryland USA , a former country music-based amusement park in Nashville, Tennessee .

The band consists of Marty Roe (lead vocals, guitar), Jimmy Olander (lead guitar, banjo), Dan Truman (keyboards), Dana Williams (bass guitar, vocals), Micah Schweinsberg (drums), and Carson McKee (fiddle, mandolin, vocals). The band was founded in 1982 as an attraction for the Opryland USA theme park in Nashville, Tennessee , and was originally known as the Grizzly River Boys, then the Tennessee River Boys. It was founded by vocalists Matt Davenport, Danny Gregg, and Ty Herndon , the last of whom became a solo artist in the mid-1990s. After undergoing several membership changes in its initial years, the band held the same membership from 1989 to 2023, which consisted of Roe, Olander, Truman, Williams, Brian Prout (drums), and Gene Johnson (fiddle, mandolin, vocals). After the latter two retired in 2022, they were respectively replaced by Schweinsberg and McKee. Diamond Rio was signed to Arista Nashville in 1991 and debuted with the single \" Meet in the Middle \", which made them the first band ever to send a debut single to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. The band charted 32 more singles between then and 2006, including four more that reached No. 1: \" How",

Originally intended to promote the park through a one-time television special, the band proved popular enough that it became one of many regular performers there. Davenport, Gregg, and Ty Herndon alternated as lead vocalists, with Davenport also playing bass guitar and Gregg on rhythm guitar; completing the lineup were Larry Beard (lead guitar, fiddle, banjo), Mel Deal (steel guitar), Al DeLeonibus (piano), and Ed Mummert (drums). The group \"swapped lead voices, told jokes, and balanced old-school country concert shtick with a contemporary sound\". Herndon left the group in 1983 to compete on the talent show Star Search , and became a solo artist for Epic Records between 1995 and the early 2000s. Herndon was temporarily replaced by Anthony Crawford and then Virgil True before his role was taken over by Marty Roe, who had originally toured nationally with the Christian band Windsong, and worked in the park by doing impersonations of Larry Gatlin . Following Herndon's departure, DeLonibus and Mummert quit as well, with Dan Truman (who had previously played in Brigham Young University 's Young Ambassadors ) and Jimmy \"J.

Background In 2003, songwriter and record producer Jason Deere began teaching the Old and New Testament in an early morning seminary class for high school students of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Franklin, Tennessee. His research and teaching inspired him to write an album of songs about the early church history, from 1820 to 1844. The album Joseph: A Nashville Tribute to the Prophet was co-produced with Deere's longtime friend, Dan Truman, of Diamond Rio. Truman also wrote one of the songs on the album. The album was released by Deseret Book ’s Highway Records in 2005 and it became one of its best-selling albums,  winning Pearl Awards for Contemporary Album Of The Year, Inspirational Recording Of The Year (Emma), Contemporary Instrumental Recorded Song Of The Year (Say Uncle), Songwriter Of The Year (Jason Deere).  The LDS Booksellers Association also awarded the album a 2006 Listener's Choice Award for Album Of The Year and awarded Deere a 2006 Listener's Choice Award for Best New Artist.  Deere and Truman co-produced a second Nashville Tribute album released in 2007 called Trek: A Nashville Tribute to the Pioneers . The album covered the Mormon pioneer era of LDS Church history.

Said tour, focused on songs from their 2007 Christmas album, was the band's first since before the COVID-19 pandemic . Schweinsberg and McKee both became official members of the band in mid-2023, making McKee the band's first female member. The first single following their addition to the lineup, an instrumental called \"The Kick\", was released soon after. Outside contributions Diamond Rio has been featured on several projects featuring multiple country artists, including three tribute albums released between 1993 and 1994. The first was a cover of the Eagles ' 1975 hit \" Lyin' Eyes \" for Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles , an album released in late 1993 via Giant Records which featured various country musicians covering that band's songs. Diamond Rio had originally wanted to record the song for Love a Little Stronger , but DuBois rejected the idea because he felt that they were not yet well-established enough to record a cover song on one of their own albums. The second was Keith Whitley: A Tribute Album , to which they contributed a cover of Keith Whitley 's 1986 hit \" Ten Feet Away \", and the third was a cover of Merle Haggard 's \" Workin' Man Blues \" for a tribute album entitled",
