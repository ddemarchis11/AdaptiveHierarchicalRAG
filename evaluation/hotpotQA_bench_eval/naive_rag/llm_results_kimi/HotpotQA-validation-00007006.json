      "text": "The Time Quintet is a science fantasy series of five young adult novels written by American author Madeleine L'Engle and made up of A Wrinkle in Time (1962), A Wind in the Door (1973), A Swiftly Tilting Planet (1978), Many Waters (1986), and An Acceptable Time (1989). Publishing history The series originated with A Wrinkle in Time , written from 1959 to 1960 and turned down by 26 publishers before Farrar, Straus and Giroux finally published it in 1962 . A Wrinkle in Time won the Newbery Medal and has sold over 6 million copies. The sequel, A Wind in the Door , takes place a year later but was published over a decade later, in 1973 . A Swiftly Tilting Planet , set ten years after A Wrinkle in Time , followed in 1978 . The fourth title, Many Waters , was published in 1986 , but takes place before A Swiftly Tilting Planet . (This is apparent as Sandy and Dennys Murry are in high school as of Many Waters , but in college at the time of A Swiftly Tilting Planet . As of Many Waters , Meg is also unmarried.) The final title in the series is An Acceptable Time , published in 1989 . All five titles have been published in numerous editions over the years, with varying in cover art and, in 1997, a new introduction",

Plot When Homer is outraged by the family's high electricity bill, they attend an alternate energy expo and purchase a wind turbine . At first the turbine produces an excess of electricity which the electric company leeches, so Homer decides the family will live off the grid so the company can't use \"their\" electricity. They soon discover that they have no electricity when there is no wind. Homer tries to power the turbine with fans plugged into Ned Flanders ' house, but Ned angrily disconnects them. One evening Bart is manually turning the turbine so Lisa can watch House , and when he prays for wind, a severe storm blows through town.",

He teaches and helps Meg kythe, which is best described as an advanced form of telepathy . Naomi Kritzer has described meeting L'Engle when she (Kritzer) was nine and asking what Progo's fate was, to which L'Engle replied \"He's the wind at the end that blows the door open. That's him coming back.\" Story development The novel grew out of a short story, \"Intergalactic P.S. 3\", first published as a pamphlet for Children's Book Week in 1970. In this early version of the narrative, Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which from A Wrinkle in Time send Charles Wallace, Meg and Calvin to a school on another planet, where Proginoskes and a conifer seed version of Sporos are among their classmates. As in the novel, Meg must identify the real Mr. Jenkins among his two impostors. If she fails, it will be \"a victory for the Dark Shadow\" (i.e. the Black Thing). In Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith and Art , L'Engle states that at one stage in the writing of A Wind in the Door , she knew who most of the characters would be, including Progo, the snake and \"the three Mr. Jenkinses.\" She had difficulty developing the story,",
