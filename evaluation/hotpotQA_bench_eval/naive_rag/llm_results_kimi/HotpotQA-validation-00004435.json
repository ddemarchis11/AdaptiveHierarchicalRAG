The programmes did much to lift the profile of the double-act, and began a resurgence of interest in their work. In August 1998, Wise was asked to take part in the documentary Bring Me Sunshine: The Heart and Soul of Eric Morecambe . He agreed to do so but he was too ill by the time he was due to be interviewed in late 1998. He died on 21 March 1999. External links Morecambe and Wise: Bring Me Sunshine at BBC Online References",

Morecambe often referred to Harpenden in his comedy, with a band once appearing on the show named The Harpenden Hot-Shots and in a Casanova sketch he introduced himself as Lord Eric, Fourth Duke of Harpenden \"and certain parts of Birkenhead \". Morecambe was the guest of honour, and performed the opening ceremony at the 75th Anniversary Fete of St George's School, Harpenden. A West End Show, The Play What I Wrote , opened in 2001 as a tribute to the duo. Directed by Kenneth Branagh , each performance featured a different guest celebrity. In March 2003, the show transferred to Broadway . In 2003, Morecambe's eldest son Gary released \"Life's Not Hollywood, It's Cricklewood \" , a biography of his father from the point of view of his family, using family photos and extracts from previously unseen diaries. Kenilworth Road Stadium, the home of Luton Town F.C. , has a suite named after Morecambe. He was a supporter and one-time president of the club.",

      "text": "Bring Me Sunshine was originally a three-part retrospective in tribute to Eric Morecambe and was hosted by the comedian and author Ben Elton , who is a big fan of Morecambe and Wise; the first episode was screened on 14 May 1994, which would have been his 68th birthday and featured interviews with many people who had guest starred in The Morecambe & Wise Show during its run from 1968 to 1977 and also had a host of memorable clips from the shows. Those interviewed included John Thaw , Roy Castle who died a few months afterwards, Diana Rigg as well as comments and tributes from modern day double acts Hale & Pace and Fry & Laurie . Such was the popularity of the show (which aired in a Saturday evening prime-time slot) that three further editions were hastily commissioned and shown on BBC1 but the three later additions did not include interviews, just classic clips. This meant that the duo, having last performed together in late 1983, made an unexpected and triumphant return to prime time television after a break of over 10 years. Ernie Wise was not asked to participate, which upset him; he was quoted as saying \" ...you'd have thought they'd have asked for my memories... \". The BBC said they didn't want \"Too many talking heads\". However, the fact that Wise was recovering from a minor stroke he suffered just before Christmas 1993 might have been a factor in his exclusion. The programmes did",

King said of the demos: \"That was the first time I realised they were going to write all their own material; Syd just turned into a songwriter, it seemed like overnight.\" Barrett's light gray \"Mirrored\" Fender Esquire at the Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains exhibition in Toronto. Barrett wrote the group's first single, \" Arnold Layne \" about a man stealing clothes from washing lines. Shortly afterwards, Pink Floyd signed a record deal with EMI . They recorded the album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , intermittently between February and July 1967 in Studio 3 at Abbey Road Studios (then called EMI Recording Studios), and produced by the former Beatles engineer Norman Smith . Of the eleven songs, Barrett wrote eight and co-wrote another two. The album reached number six on the British album charts. Health problems Through late 1967 and early 1968, Barrett became increasingly erratic, partly due to his heavy use of drugs such as LSD , amphetamine, and Mandrax. He developed a blank, dead-eyed stare. Barrett did not recognise friends and he often did not know where he was. While Pink Floyd were recording \" See Emily Play \" at the Sound Techniques studio, Gilmour stopped by on his return visit from Europe to say hello to Barrett. According to Gilmour, he \"just looked straight through me, barely acknowledged me that I was there\".",
