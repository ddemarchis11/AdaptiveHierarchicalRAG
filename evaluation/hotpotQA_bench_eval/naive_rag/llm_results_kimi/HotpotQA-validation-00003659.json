      "text": "Spanish River Boulevard is a short east–west highway in Boca Raton , Palm Beach County , Florida . The eastern 0.5 miles (0.80 km) is signed as State Road 800 ( SR 800 ), though the western segment was formerly SR 800 as well. The western terminus of the boulevard is at Military Trail (County Road 809 or CR 809) , but the state route does not begin until Federal Highway ( U.S. Route 1 or US 1). Both the state route and the road itself terminate at Ocean Boulevard ( SR A1A ) near the Atlantic Ocean shoreline at the northeastern corner of Spanish River Park, near Highland Beach . Spanish River Boulevard provides the only access to SR A1A and the Boca Raton beaches in northern Boca Raton. It is one of only three beach access roads within the Boca Raton city limits, the other two being Palmetto Park Road ( CR 798 ) and Camino Real. SR 800 is one of two state highways in the x00 series that does not follow the numbering system; the other is SR 300 , the designation for the St. George Island Bridge . All other x00 routes are major cross-state diagonals.

FM 688 is the old alignment through Forney , bypassed in 1959 by the present freeway. Most of this route was a spur of FM 740 until 1960. Louisiana View down Texas Street, a section of US 80 in downtown Shreveport US 80 was routed along the existing Dixie Overland Highway throughout Louisiana. Since 1921, this auto trail had also carried the designations of State Route 1 west of Shreveport and State Route 4 from Shreveport eastward. These routes remained co-signed with US 80 until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering . The few significant changes to the alignment of US 80 over the years have resulted from the addition or replacement of bridges along the route, improvements that were largely carried out during the 1930s and the mid-1950s. The biggest project involved the construction of the first Vicksburg Bridge across the Mississippi River in 1930. This was followed by new bridges across the Red River at Shreveport– Bossier City ( Long–Allen Bridge , 1933) and the Ouachita River in Monroe ( P.M. Atkins Bridge , 1936). In both cases, new alignments carried",

      "text": "The Suffolk Traction Company is a former streetcar system in Suffolk County, New York . It operated primarily between Patchogue and Holtsville , but also included a route that served Blue Point , Bayport , and Sayville . It was opened in 1909 and ceased operations in 1919. Main Line The four current roads that originally carried the trolley line between Patchogue and Holtsville are South Ocean Avenue, North Ocean Avenue , and what today is Old North Ocean Avenue. The PD Tower at Patchogue Railroad Station served as a control tower for both the Long Island Railroad and the trolleys. Traction Boulevard (also known as Suffolk Traction Boulevard) continued the line, which crossed over the southeast corner of Canaan Lake and headed in a northwesterly direction. North of the Patchogue Highlands area, the paved road became a dirt trail and carried the former ROW towards Holtsville Station . The trolleys that used the road were storage battery cars that ran down the center of the street. North of Holtsville, Suffolk Traction planned an extension through Farmingville , Selden , Terryville , Echo (now Port Jefferson Station ), and eventually Port Jefferson . Unfortunately, the company went bankrupt, even as a bridge was being built over the LIRR Main Line for the Suffolk Traction Main Line on the way to Port Jefferson. The ROW was abandoned, and much of it was sold to private and public developers later in the 20th century,",
