      "text": "Cast and filming Tamzin Outhwaite (pictured, 2015) starred in \"Empty Orchestra\" as Connie, who is in fancy dress as Amy Winehouse . \"Empty Orchestra\" stars Pemberton as Roger, who is celebrating a promotion with five colleagues: Greg, played by Shearsmith; Connie, played by Outhwaite; Fran, played by Hadland; Janet, played by Emily Howlett; and Duane, played by Prince. Rebekah Hinds also stars as Chantel. As an anthology series, Inside No. 9 features a new cast each episode, which the writers say re-energises them. During filming, Outhwaite and Hadland said that Pemberton and Shearsmith would not enjoy working with another cast more; the following week, the writers jokingly sent them pictures with Fiona Shaw and Morgana Robinson (who star in \" Private View \"), claiming to be having more fun. Howlett, like Janet, is deaf . Unlike Howlett, however, Janet is \"quite passive, quiet, sweet and generally happy looking after people, especially her boss\". As Janet sings, Howlett faced a particular acting challenge. She possesses, she explained, \"very little understanding of what constitutes music, and no idea at all about things like keys, pitch or melody – I even struggle with the concept of 'high' and 'low' sounds\". The song Janet sings—\" Only You \" by Yazoo —was particularly",

      "text": "\" Empty Orchestra \" is the fourth episode of the third series of the British dark comedy anthology television programme Inside No. 9 . Written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith and directed by Guillem Morales , the episode was first shown on 7 March 2017, on BBC Two . \"Empty Orchestra\" is set in a karaoke booth, and follows a group of colleagues—Greg (Shearsmith), Fran ( Sarah Hadland ), Connie ( Tamzin Outhwaite ), Janet (Emily Howlett) and Duane ( Javone Prince )—celebrating the promotion of Roger (Pemberton). Rebekah Hinds also features. \"Empty Orchestra\" is close to a musical . The characters sing throughout much of the episode, with the story being told through the lyrics and the way the characters interact during songs. In comparison to other episodes of Inside No. 9 , \"Empty Orchestra\" is upbeat, features romantic elements, and lacks explicitly bloody or macabre references. The filming experience and resulting episode was a highlight of the series for Pemberton, but raised technical challenges, in part due to simultaneous singing and talking. Television critics had a mixed reaction to the episode. In both The Daily Telegraph and The National , it was characterised as weaker than others in the series. The change in tone divided commentators, some of whom found the setting and constant noise a distraction. The writing and production, however, were praised, while the cast were",
