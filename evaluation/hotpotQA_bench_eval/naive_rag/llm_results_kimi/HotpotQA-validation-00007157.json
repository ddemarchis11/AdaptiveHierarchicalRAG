      "text": "Steven E. Landsburg (born February 24, 1954) is an American professor of economics at the University of Rochester in Rochester , New York . From 1989 to 1995, he taught at Colorado State University . Landsburg is also an outspoken commentator on economic, legal, and political issues whose comments have sometimes been regarded as controversial. Education Landsburg was an undergraduate at the University of Rochester. He received a PhD in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1979. Writings and work Commentary and opinions Landsburg wrote a column on \"everyday economics\" for Slate magazine from 1996 to 2008. The subjects of the columns were diverse and often drew on current affairs. In them, Landsburg discussed the national debt , the obesity crisis , payments to Hurricane Katrina evacuees in New Orleans and salary caps in the NFL . Landsburg also discussed recent research in micro-economics and its implications, as in an article on the value of mobile phones and driving , the (career) cost of motherhood , and whether or not daughters (as opposed to sons) cause divorce . Landsburg also addressed legal issues: in a Slate column from 2003, he proposed punishing jurors when a jury's decision is later \"proven\" to be wrong, such as when an acquitted defendant later admits to committing the crime. If a jury's judgment is later \"proven\" to be right, Landsburg suggested the jurors should be financially rewarded.",
