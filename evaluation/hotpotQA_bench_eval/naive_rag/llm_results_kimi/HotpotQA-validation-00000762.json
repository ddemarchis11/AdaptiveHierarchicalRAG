From 2010, they were superseded with Mitsubishi's self-developed 4N1 diesel engines. 2006–2024: Chinese joint ventures As of 2006, Mitsubishi had four joint ventures with Chinese partners: South East (Fujian) Motor Co Ltd Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing Co Ltd Harbin Dongan Automotive Engine Manufacturing Co Ltd – a subsidiary of Harbin Hafei Automobile Industry Group Co Ltd Hunan Changfeng Motor Co Ltd – a subsidiary of Chang Feng (Group) Co Ltd 2010–present: Nissan, Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi In December 2010, Mitsubishi and Nissan agreed to form a joint venture (later named \" NMKV Co., Ltd.\") to develop kei cars for the Japanese market. In 2016, Nissan uncovered evidence that Mitsubishi's fuel-economy testing numbers were erroneous and had been erroneous since the start of the venture, affecting 625,000 cars produced by NMKV. The result of the \"fuel economy scandal\" was that Nissan acquired a controlling interest in Mitsubishi. 2024–present: Nissan and Honda alliance In July 2024, Mitsubishi Motors and Nissan announced a partnership with Honda for the joint development of their future electric models.

Due to dilution of existing shares, other Mitsubishi group companies (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Corp., and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ) had their combined holdings in Mitsubishi Motors fall to about 20% from 34% previously. MMNA stated that vehicles sold from 2013 in the United States featured accurate fuel-economy information and were thereby not affected by the scandal. In May 2016, Mitsubishi Motors announced Tetsuro Aikawa was to resign as the president of the company in effect in June 2016. Both Mitsubishi Motors and Aikawa denied any top management involvement in the mileage scandal.
