      "text": "Crash is a British card game extension of Nine-card Brag and indeed is sometimes known as Thirteen Card Brag. In Crash, there is no betting, as in Brag, but rather players aim to reach a total of 15 points, gained over successive deals. Distribution Crash is played over much of northern England and Wales from Coventry and Burton-on-Trent in the south to the counties of Cumbria and Yorkshire in the north, also in Welshpool in north central Wales and in South Wales. It is also recorded in Plymouth and Edinburgh , where it is called Crackers . Rules Crash has many rule variations. Deal and play Players are dealt 13 cards each and must sort their hand into 4 Brag hands of three cards, or if you are lucky enough, in 3 sets of 4 of a kind, discarding the last remaining card. The hands rank as in Brag with the highest ranking hand being, 3 threes. All other hands are the same. Once the players have sorted their hands, each plays their highest ranked hand, and the player playing the highest gains one point. If hands are tied, no-one scores. Players then play their second-best hands, then their third best, then final hands. Note that not all players accept 'high card' hands, and many do not accept 'pairs', which means that it is quite common for a player not to have four hands. 'Crashing' Crashing in this game involve",

      "text": "Brag is an 18th century British card game , and the British national representative of the vying or \"bluffing\" family of gambling games. It is a descendant of the Elizabethan game of Primero and one of the several ancestors to poker , the modern version just varying in betting style and hand rankings. It has been described as the \"longest-standing British representative of the Poker family.\" History The rules of Brag first appear in 1721 in The Compleat Gamester where it is referred to as \"The Ingenious and Pleasant Game of Bragg\" , but in fact, it originates in an almost identical game called Post and Pair which is recorded as far back as 1528 (as Post ) and which, in turn, was descended from Primero. However, Brag introduced a key innovation over Post and Pair: the concept of wild cards known as 'braggers'. Initially there was just one, the Knave of Clubs ; later the Nine of Diamonds was added. In parallel with this early three-stake game, in 1751 Hoyle describes a version of Brag with a shortened pack that only had a single phase – the vying or 'bragging' round – with special powers for certain Jacks and Nines, thus anticipating the modern single-stake game. In 1825, an early American account of Brag describes a much more elaborate single-stake game with a complex vying procedure. Not until",

If two or more scored the same, they drew again until a winner was established. American Brag In 1825, the first American account of Brag appeared in a New York edition of Hoyle's Games Improved . This was a far more elaborate variant based solely on the bragging phase of classic Brag. Modern Brag Modern Brag, often called Three-Card Brag to distinguish it from its variants, is a single-stake game. Everyone antes , and players are each dealt three cards face down. There is a single round of betting, with action starting to the left of the dealer. Each player has the option of betting or folding . If there was a previous bet, the player must contribute at least that much more to the pot. (Unlike usual poker betting, a player's previous money contributed to the pot is ignored.) This betting continues until there are only two players left, at which point either player may double the previous bet to see his opponent. At this point, the two hands are revealed, and the player with the better hand takes the entire pot. If there is a tie, the player who is seeing loses. Hand ranks Hands generally follow the same sequence as the five-card hands of poker with some variation created by the differing odds of a three-card",

      "text": "Triomphe (French for triumph), once known as French ruff , is a card game dating from the late 15th century. It most likely originated in France or Spain (as triunfo) and later spread to the rest of Europe. When the game arrived in Italy, it shared a similar name with the pre-existing game and deck known as trionfi ; probably resulting in the latter becoming renamed as Tarocchi ( tarot ). While trionfi has a fifth suit that acts as permanent trumps , triomphe randomly selects one of the existing four suits as trumps. Another common feature of this game is the robbing of the stock. Triomphe became so popular that during the 16th century the earlier game of trionfi was gradually renamed tarocchi, tarot, or tarock. This game is the origin of the English word \"trump\" and is the ancestor of many trick-taking games like Euchre (via Écarté ) and Whist (via Ruff and Honours ). The earliest known description of Triomphe was of a point-trick game , perhaps one of the earliest of its type; later, the name was applied to a plain-trick game . Spanish rules The earliest surviving description was written by Juan Luis Vives in his Exercitatio linguae latinae around 1538 in Basel . As he left Spain in 1509 never to return, the rules may date to his youth.",

Cotton's account of 1674 is reprinted until 1750 and appears again in Bohn (1850) and no other descriptions appear during the 18th century. Put (19th century) Pigott (1800) introduces new information. For the first time, methods of keeping score are described: whist counters, money as counters, chalking or drawing 5 lines or strokes with a pencil or chalk and erasing 1 line per point; the first to erase all 5 winning the game. In terms of play; a player can \"throw up his cards\", i.e. fold, on viewing the cards dealt or before playing a card to a trick, thus conceding 1 point to the opponent. Otherwise there is no practical change to the rules, a player being allowed to challenge with \"I put\" which, if accepted, means they will both play for the game. For the first time four-handed Put is described, whereby each person has a partner and when the cards are dealt, one partner gives the other their best card and throws the others two away; the partner receiving the card discards their worst card and a two-hand game is then played as normal. Strategy Considerable daring is necessary in this game, for a bold player will often \"Put\" upon very bad",
