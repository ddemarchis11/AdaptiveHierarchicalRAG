      "text": "Two Weeks Notice is a 2002 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Marc Lawrence and starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant , with Alicia Witt , Dana Ivey , Robert Klein , and Heather Burns in supporting roles. In the film, an idealistic, liberal lawyer (Bullock) goes to work for a narcissistic, billionaire developer (Grant) and they form an unlikely pair. The film was released in the United States on December 20, 2002, by Warner Bros. Pictures . It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $199 million worldwide. Plot The \"Coney Island community center\" Lucy wants to preserve was actually the Childs Restaurant location on Coney Island 's Riegelmann Boardwalk . It was declared a New York Landmark a month after the film's premiere. It closed later (as in this 2013 picture) and, after renovation, became part of the Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island . Lucy Kelson is an intelligent, highly competent liberal lawyer who specializes in historic preservation, environmental law, and pro bono cases in New York City . George Wade is an arrogant, needy billionaire real estate developer and stylish playboy, who is also quite naïve. Lucy's hard work and devotion to others contrasts sharply with George's childish recklessness and greed. Lucy meets George in an attempt to stop the destruction of the Coney Island community center from her childhood. Learning that she graduated from the prestigious Harvard Law School , he",

      "text": "\"Though Two Weeks Notice has nothing new to add to the crowded genre, Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock make the movie a pleasant, if predictable, sit.\" Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 42 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 and wrote: \"… some of the dialogue has a real zing to it. There were wicked little one-liners that slipped in under the radar and nudged the audience in the ribs.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote that it \"Knows what it needs to do for both its stars, does it, and doesn't make a federal case about it. I'd watch these two together again in a New York minute.\" David Rooney of Variety called it: \"An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer's previous collaboration, \"Miss Congeniality.\"\" Box office Two Weeks Notice opened at number two domestically, behind The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers , and spent its first five weeks in the Top 10 at the box office. It grossed $93.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $105.7 million in",
