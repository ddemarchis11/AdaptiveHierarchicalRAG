It was packaged in a tan-sided box. Reception In the 1980 book The Complete Book of Wargames , game designer Jon Freeman reviewed the 1977 edition and commented: \" Basic Dungeons & Dragons is only a starter set and effectively obsolete a few weeks after you get a campaign going\". Having called the original D&D set \"the most illiterate display of poor grammar, misspelling, and typographical errors in all of professional wargaming\", Freeman was pleased that this edition had been written \"by someone outside the TSR establishment who knew a noun from a verb, and the difference shows\".
