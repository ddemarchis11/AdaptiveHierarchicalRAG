Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times , gave Unbreakable 3 out of 4 stars and had largely enjoyed the film, but was disappointed with the ending. Ebert believed that Willis's \"subtle acting\" was positively different from the actor's usual work in \"brainless action movies\". Richard Corliss of Time opined that Unbreakable continued Shyamalan's previous approach of \"balancing sophistication and horror in all of his movies\". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post wrote that \"just as he did in The Sixth Sense , writer-director M. Night Shyamalan leads you into a fascinating labyrinth , an alternative universe that lurks right under our noses. In this case, it's the mythological world and, in these modern times, the secret design to that labyrinth, the key to the path, is contained in comic books.\" Kenneth Turan , writing for the Los Angeles Times , gave a negative review, arguing that Unbreakable had no originality. \"Whether it means to or not, the shadow of The Sixth Sense hangs over Unbreakable ,\" Turan reasoned.",

The original character, Kevin Wendell Crumb, would later be fully realized in Split . Glass Shyamalan expressed hope for a third installment following Split , saying, \"I hope [a third Unbreakable film happens]. The answer is yes. I'm just such a wimp sometimes. I don't know what's going to happen when I go off in my room, a week after this film opens, to write the script. But I'm going to start writing. [I have] a really robust outline, which is pretty intricate. But now the standards for my outlines are higher. I need to know I've won already. I'm almost there but I'm not quite there.\" In April 2017, Shyamalan announced the official title, release date, and returning actors for the third movie. The film, titled Glass , was released on January 18, 2019, and features Bruce Willis , Samuel L. Jackson , Anya Taylor-Joy , and James McAvoy returning to their respective roles in the series.

      "text": "David Dunn is a fictional superhero and protagonist in M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable film series , portrayed by American actor Bruce Willis . Dunn is a former college football prodigy and a security guard who discovers he has superhuman abilities. He is the protagonist in Unbreakable , makes a cameo in Split , and again is a major character in Glass . Development Creation and casting When M. Night Shyamalan conceived the idea for Unbreakable , the outline had a comic book's traditional three-part structure: the superhero's \"birth,\" his struggles against general evil-doers, and the hero's ultimate battle against the \"archenemy.\" However, he found the origin story most interesting, and chose to write Unbreakable as one. Willis became attached while shooting The Sixth Sense , also directed by Shyamalan. Powers and abilities David Dunn possesses super-strength, enough to rip off a car door, bench press 500 pounds, break down a steel door, bend metal bars, and hurl a grown man several feet with tremendous force. With nothing to brace against while submerged, he was able to strike the weakened wall of a plastic water tank until it broke. He has nigh-invulnerability that renders him immune to disease and injuries, including traumas and shocks that would kill a normal human. Additionally, David possesses the ability of psychometry. He is able to intuitively read the minds of others, particularly as they relate to acts of violence and",

      "text": "film's disappointing box office performance. In a September 2008 article, Shyamalan and Samuel L. Jackson said there was some discussion of a sequel when the film was being made, but that it mostly died with the disappointing box office. Jackson said he was still interested in a sequel but Shyamalan was non-committal. In February 2010, Willis said that Shyamalan was \"still thinking about doing the fight movie between me and Sam that we were going to do\", and stated that as long as Jackson was able to participate he would be \"up for it\". Split In September 2010, Shyamalan revealed that an additional villain had been omitted from Unbreakable in anticipation of their inclusion in a sequel, but that the character had instead been used for a forthcoming film he was writing for and producing. Shyamalan's horror thriller film Split has been described as a thematic sequel to Unbreakable , and was released on January 20, 2017. Although it was filmed substantially as a standalone film, an uncredited cameo by Bruce Willis as David Dunn indeed establishes Split as a story within the same world. Additionally, Shyamalan has stated the orange-suited villain portrayed by Chance Kelly in Unbreakable was initially going to be the character \"The Horde\". However, features of The Horde were dropped to make the character simpler in order to keep the focus on David. The original character, Kevin Wendell Crumb,",

He did praise Dylan Tichenor 's editing and James Newton Howard 's music composition. In 2002, Audrey Colombe described the movie's plot as an example of what \" Toni Morrison calls a 'dehistoricizing allegory,'\" with the Elijah Price character as yet another example of \"White Hollywood\"'s \" magical African American male character \" helping the white hero do the right thing, though Elijah is described as a rare exception to the rule that this character is \"never 'bad'\". Shyamalan admitted he was disappointed by the reaction Unbreakable received from the public and critics. Shyamalan also disliked Touchstone Pictures ' marketing campaign. He wanted to promote Unbreakable as a comic book movie, but Touchstone insisted on portraying it as a psychological thriller , similar to The Sixth Sense . Later reviews In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Unbreakable , and included it on his list of the top 20 films released since 1992, the year he became a director. Tarantino praised the film as a \"brilliant",
