      "text": "The polar bear ( Ursus maritimus ) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas. It is closely related to the brown bear , and the two species can interbreed . The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore by body mass, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species is sexually dimorphic , as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water. Polar bears are both terrestrial and pagophilic (ice-living) and are considered marine mammals because of their dependence on marine ecosystems . They prefer the annual sea ice but live on land when the ice melts in the summer. They are mostly carnivorous and specialized for preying on seals , particularly ringed seals . Such prey is typically taken by ambush; the bear may stalk its prey on the ice or in the water, but also will stay at a breathing hole or ice edge to wait for prey to swim by. The bear primarily feeds on the seal's energy-rich blubber . Other prey include walruses , beluga whales and some terrestrial animals. Polar bears are usually solitary",

      "text": "of a \"polar bear king\" known as the bjarndýrakóngur . This beast was depicted as a polar bear with \"ruddy cheeks\" and a unicorn -like horn, which glows in the dark. The king could understand when humans talk and was considered to be very astute. Two Norwegian fairy tales, \" East of the Sun and West of the Moon \" and \" White-Bear-King-Valemon \", involve white bears turning into men and seducing women. Drawings of polar bears have been featured on maps of the northern regions. Possibly the earliest depictions of a polar bear on a map is the Swedish Carta marina of 1539, which has a white bear on Iceland or \"Islandia\". A 1544 map of North America includes two polar bears near Quebec . Notable paintings featuring polar bears include François-Auguste Biard 's Fighting Polar Bears (1839) and Edwin Landseer 's Man Proposes, God Disposes (1864). Polar bears have also been filmed for cinema. An Inuit polar bear hunt was shot for the 1932 documentary Igloo , while the 1974 film The White Dawn filmed a simulated stabbing of a trained bear for a scene. In the film The Big Show (1961), two characters are killed by a circus polar bear. The scenes were shot using animal trainers instead of the actors. In modern literature, polar bears have been characters in both",

Polar bears are usually solitary but can be found in groups when on land. During the breeding season, male bears guard females and defend them from rivals. Mothers give birth to cubs in maternity dens during the winter. Young stay with their mother for up to two and a half years. The polar bear is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with an estimated total population of 22,000 to 31,000 individuals. Its biggest threats are climate change , pollution and energy development. Climate change has caused a decline in sea ice , giving the polar bear less access to its favoured prey and increasing the risk of malnutrition and starvation. Less sea ice also means that the bears must spend more time on land, increasing conflicts with humans. Polar bears have been hunted, both by native and non-native peoples, for their coats, meat and other items. They have been kept in captivity in zoos and circuses and are prevalent in art, folklore, religion and modern culture. Naming The polar bear was given its common name by Thomas Pennant in A Synopsis of Quadrupeds (1771). It was known as the \"white bear\" in Europe between the 13th and 18th centuries, as well as \"ice bear\", \"sea bear\" and \" Greenland bear\". The Norse referred to it as",

In modern literature, polar bears have been characters in both children's fiction , like Hans Beer's Little Polar Bear and the Whales and Sakiasi Qaunaq's The Orphan and the Polar Bear , and fantasy novels, like Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials series. In radio, Mel Blanc provided the vocals for Jack Benny 's pet polar bear Carmichael on The Jack Benny Program . The polar bear is featured on flags and coats of arms, like the coat of arms of Greenland , and in many advertisements, notably for Coca-Cola since 1922. As charismatic megafauna , polar bears have been used to raise awareness of the dangers of climate change. Aurora the polar bear is a giant marionette created by Greenpeace for climate protests. The World Wide Fund for Nature has sold plush polar bears as part of its \"Arctic Home\" campaign. Photographs of polar bears have been featured in National Geographic and Time magazines, including ones of them standing on ice floes, while the climate change documentary and advocacy film An Inconvenient Truth (2006) includes an animated bear swimming. Automobile manufacturer Nissan used a polar bear in one of its commercials, hugging a man for using an electric car. To make a statement about global warming, in 2009 a Copenhagen ice statue of a polar bear with a bronze skeleton was purposely left to melt in the sun. See",

      "text": "bears and describe their habits. Such accounts became more accurate after the Enlightenment , and both living and dead specimens were brought back. Nevertheless, some fanciful reports continued, including the idea that polar bears cover their noses during hunts. A relatively accurate drawing of a polar bear is found in Henry Ellis 's work A Voyage to Hudson's Bay (1748). Polar bears were formally classified as a species by Constantine Phipps after his 1773 voyage to the Arctic. Accompanying him was a young Horatio Nelson , who was said to have wanted to get a polar bear coat for his father but failed in his hunt. In his 1785 edition of Histoire Naturelle , Comte de Buffon mentions and depicts a \"sea bear\", clearly a polar bear, and \"land bears\", likely brown and black bears. This helped promote ideas about speciation . Buffon also mentioned a \"white bear of the forest\", possibly a Kermode bear . Exploitation Hunter with polar bear slain with bow and arrow in Alaska (1924) Polar bears were hunted as early as 8,000 years ago, as indicated by archaeological remains at Zhokhov Island in the East Siberian Sea . The oldest graphic depiction of a polar bear shows it being hunted by a man with three dogs. This rock art was among several petroglyphs found at Pegtymel in Siberia and dates from the fifth to eighth centuries. Before access to firearms, native people",
