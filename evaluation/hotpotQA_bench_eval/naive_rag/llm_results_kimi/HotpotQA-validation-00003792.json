He is a guitarist and founding member of the nu metal band Korn and his solo project Love and Death , where he also provides vocals. Along with fellow Korn guitarist James \"Munky\" Shaffer , Welch helped develop Korn's distinctive sound (a mix of sirenlike shards of dissonant guitar that mimicked a turntablist 's various effects and rumbling down-tuned riffing) that defined the nu metal aesthetic beginning in the mid-'90s. After becoming a Christian , Welch left the band in 2005 to focus on life as a father and to pursue his own solo career. He released his debut Christian album, Save Me from Myself , in 2008. He reunited with Korn on-stage at the Carolina Rebellion in May 2012 for the first time in seven years; Welch officially announced in May 2013 that he was rejoining the band. Welch and Munky were ranked at No. 26 of Guitar World ' s 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time.

Korn III: Remember Who You Are isn't a numbering device, it signifies an opening of another phase in Korn's career.

On May 5, 2012, guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch joined Korn on stage at the Carolina Rebellion festival to play \"Blind\" for the first time since his departure. As recalled in the documentary DVD Reconciliation , Welch's appearance was a spur-of-the-moment decision: Welch initially visited the festival because of his daughter, who was a fan of bands performing. Welch joined Red on stage for a song, and would eventually be persuaded to join his old bandmates in Korn for a meet and greet . Upon Korn preparing for the show, the guitar tech prepared an extra guitar and amplifier for Welch, \"just in case\". On July 18, 2012, Jonathan Davis told Billboard.com that Korn was getting ready to start recording their eleventh studio album that would be released independently. It was also announced that their next album would not contain any dubstep influences like The Path of Totality .

I think maybe I deserved those songs because of some of the stuff that I said after I quit the band. So it's all good. In July 2005, Welch appeared on CNN's feature-format program \"People in the News\", where he admitted to having been addicted to alcohol, methamphetamine , Xanax , and sleeping pills before being introduced to the Christian faith. In a podcast with Headbanger's Blog, on May 30, 2008, Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis expressed interest in playing with Welch on the band's upcoming album, but stated that it is not likely. In September 2009, Korn guitarist Munky, in an interview with Altitude TV, alleged that the band had denied a request by Welch to rejoin the outfit. In the interview, Munky claimed: Brian actually contacted us recently and wanted to come back to the band. And it was not the right time... for us. We're doing well, and it's kind of like... It's kind of like if you divorced your wife and she went on and she stayed successful and her career flourished, and you go back and [say], 'My gosh, she's still hot. Baby, can we get back together?'",

It was released on January 17, 2012, and has since become the band's best charting Billboard topping album, debuting and peaking at number 11 on the Billboard 200, selling more than 17,000 copies in its first week. Despite the band's growing success, Caleb Shomo left the band later that year due to clinical depression he had been dealing with since middle school. This had been causing him to have suicidal tendencies, and struggle with eating disorders, self-image problems and various substance abuse and addictions for the past year. Despite this, he left the band on good terms with the rest of the band supporting his decision. The band itself officially disbanded",
