      "text": "of sorrow and hopelessness and despair; and also passion, high hopes, deep love, and eternal love. —Jennifer Warnes, describing Cohen's lyrics In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional Recent Songs , which blended his acoustic style with jazz and East Asian and Mediterranean influences. Beginning with this record, Cohen began to co-produce his albums. Produced by Cohen and Henry Lewy ( Joni Mitchell 's sound engineer), Recent Songs included performances by Passenger, an Austin-based jazz–fusion band that met Cohen through Mitchell. The band helped Cohen create a new sound by featuring instruments like the oud , the Gypsy violin, and the mandolin . The album was supported by Cohen's major tour with the new band, and Jennifer Warnes and Sharon Robinson on the backing vocals, in Europe in late 1979, and again in Australia, Israel, and Europe in 1980. In 2000, Columbia released an album of live recordings of songs from the 1979 tour, titled Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979 . During the 1970s, Cohen toured twice with Jennifer Warnes as a backup singer (1972 and 1979). Warnes would become a fixture on Cohen's future albums, receiving full co-vocals credit on Cohen's 1984 album Various Positions (although the record was released under Cohen's name, the inside credits say \"Vocals by Leonard Cohen and Jennifer Warnes\"). In 1987 she",

      "text": "Odense, Denmark, August 17, 2013 In 2011, Cohen's poetical output was represented in Everyman's Library Pocket Poets, in a selection Poems and Songs edited by Robert Faggen. The collection included a selection from all Cohen's books, based on his 1993 books of selected works, Stranger Music , and as well from Book of Longing , with addition of six new song lyrics. Nevertheless, three of those songs, \"A Street\", recited in 2006, \"Feels So Good\", performed live in 2009 and 2010, and \"Born in Chains\", performed live in 2010, were not released on Cohen's 2012 album Old Ideas , with him being unhappy with the versions of the songs in the last moment; the song \"Lullaby\", as presented in the book and performed live in 2009, was completely re-recorded for the album, presenting new lyrics on the same melody.  A biography, I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen , written by Sylvie Simmons , was published in October 2012. The book is the second major biography of Cohen (Ira Nadel's 1997 biography Various Positions was the first). Old Ideas Leonard Cohen's 12th studio album, Old Ideas , was released worldwide on January 31, 2012, and it soon became the highest-charting album of his entire career, reaching No. 1",

      "text": "away from Cohen's previous minimalist sound. In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional Recent Songs , which blended his acoustic style with jazz , East Asian, and Mediterranean influences. Cohen's most famous song, \" Hallelujah \", was released on his seventh album, Various Positions (1984). I'm Your Man in 1988 marked Cohen's turn to synthesized productions. In 1992, Cohen released its follow-up, The Future , which had dark lyrics and references to political and social unrest. Cohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of Ten New Songs , a major hit in Canada and Europe. His eleventh album, Dear Heather , followed in 2004. In 2005, Cohen discovered that his manager had stolen most of his money and sold his publishing rights, prompting a return to touring to recoup his losses. Following a successful string of tours between 2008 and 2013, he released three albums in the final years of his life: Old Ideas (2012), Popular Problems (2014), and You Want It Darker (2016), the last of which was released three weeks before his death. His fifteenth studio album, Thanks for the Dance , was released in November 2019.

Bissonnette followed up in 2020 with Death of a Ladies' Man , a film that uses seven Cohen songs in its soundtrack to illuminate key themes in the film's screenplay. The Leonard Cohen song \" So Long, Marianne \" is the title of the season 4, episode 9 episode of This Is Us . The song is played and its meaning is discussed as an important plot point of the episode. In April 2022, author and journalist Matti Friedman published Who By Fire: War, Atonement, and the Resurrection of Leonard Cohen , the story of Leonard Cohen's 1973 tour to the front lines of the Yom Kippur War. TV miniseries by Yehonatan Indursky based on the book was expected in 2024. Susan Cain , author of Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole (2022), said that humorous references to Cohen as the \"Poet Laureate of Pessimism\" miss the point that Cohen's life suggests that \"the quest to transform pain into beauty is one of the great catalysts of artistic expression\".
