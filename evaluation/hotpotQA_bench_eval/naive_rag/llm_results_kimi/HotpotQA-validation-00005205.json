Chase owned more New York City securities in the mid-1970s, when the city was nearing bankruptcy. A scandal erupted in 1974 when an audit found that losses from bond trading had been understated. In 1975 the bank was branded a \"problem bank\" by the Federal Reserve . From 1974 to 1976, Chase earnings fell 36 percent while those of its biggest rivals rose 12 to 31 percent. The bank's earnings more than doubled between 1976 and 1980, far outpacing its rival Citibank in return on assets . By 1981 the bank's finances were restored to full health. In November 1979, while chairman of the Chase Bank, Rockefeller became embroiled in an international incident when he and Henry Kissinger , along with John J. McCloy and Rockefeller aides, persuaded President Jimmy Carter through the United States Department of State to admit the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , into the United States for hospital treatment for lymphoma . This action directly precipitated what is known as the Iran hostage crisis and placed Rockefeller under intense media scrutiny, particularly from The New York Times , for the first time in his public life.

There he financed international trade in a number of commodities, such as coffee, sugar and metals. This position maintained relationships with more than 1,000 correspondent banks throughout the world. He served in other positions and became president in 1960. He was both the chairman and chief executive of Chase Manhattan from 1969 to 1980 and remained chairman until 1981. He was also, as recently as 1980, the single largest individual shareholder of the bank, holding 1.7% of its shares. During his term as CEO, Chase spread internationally and became a central component of the world's financial system due to its global network of correspondent banks, the largest in the world. In 1973, Chase established the first branch of an American bank in Moscow, in the then Soviet Union . That year Rockefeller traveled to China, resulting in his bank becoming the National Bank of China's first correspondent bank in the U.S. During this period, Chase Manhattan expanded its influence over many non-financial corporations. A 1979 study titled \"The Significance of Bank Control over Large Corporations\" provided an estimate for which large U.S.-based financial institutions had the most control over other corporations. The study finds that: \"The Rockefeller-controlled Chase Manhattan Bank tops the list, controlling 16 companies.\" He was faulted for spending excessive amounts",
