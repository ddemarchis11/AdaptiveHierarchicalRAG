      "text": "André Cayatte ( French: [kajat] ; 3 February 1909 – 6 February 1989) was a French filmmaker, writer and lawyer, who became known for his films centering on themes of crime, justice, and moral responsibility. Biography Cayatte began his directoral career at the German-controlled Continental Films during the French occupation. Some of Cayatte's earlier films that addressed his characteristic themes include Justice est faite ( Justice is Done ; 1950), Nous sommes tous des assassins ( We Are All Murderers ; 1952), and Le passage du Rhin ( Tomorrow Is My Turn ; 1960). In 1963, he undertook a bold experiment in film narrative with a set of two films: Jean-Marc ou La vie conjugale ( Anatomy of a Marriage: My Days with Jean-Marc ) and Françoise ou La vie conjugale ( Anatomy of a Marriage: My Days with Françoise ). These two films tell the same story from two different points of view. His 1973 film, There's No Smoke Without Fire , won the Silver Bear Special Jury Prize at the 23rd Berlin International Film Festival . His younger brother was the film editor Paul Cayatte .
