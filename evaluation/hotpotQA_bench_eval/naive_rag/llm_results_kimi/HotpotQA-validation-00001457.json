      "text": "Orfeo ed Euridice ( Italian: [orˈfɛːo ed euriˈdiːtʃe] ; French : Orphée et Eurydice ; English: Orpheus and Eurydice ) is an opera composed by Christoph Willibald Gluck , based on the myth of Orpheus and set to a libretto by Ranieri de' Calzabigi . It belongs to the genre of the azione teatrale , meaning an opera on a mythological subject with choruses and dancing. The piece was first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 5 October 1762, in the presence of Empress Maria Theresa . Orfeo ed Euridice is the first of Gluck's \"reform\" operas, in which he attempted to replace the abstruse plots and overly complex music of opera seria with a \"noble simplicity\" in both the music and the drama. The opera is the most popular of Gluck's works, and was one of the most influential on subsequent German operas . Variations on its plot—the underground rescue mission in which the hero must control, or conceal, his emotions—can be found in Mozart 's The Magic Flute , Beethoven 's Fidelio , and Wagner 's Das Rheingold . Though originally set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to the genre of",

      "text": "Paride ed Elena ( Italian pronunciation: [ˈpaːride ed ˈɛːlena] ; Paris and Helen ) is an opera by Christoph Willibald Gluck . It is the third of Gluck's so-called reform operas for Vienna, following Orfeo ed Euridice and Alceste , and the least often performed of the three. Like its predecessors, the libretto was written by Ranieri de' Calzabigi . The opera tells the story of the events between the Judgment of Paris and the flight of Paris and Helen to Troy . It was premiered at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 3 November 1770. Roles Synopsis The hero Paris is in Sparta , having chosen Aphrodite above Hera and Athena , sacrificing to Aphrodite and seeking, with the encouragement of Erasto, the love of Helen . Paris and Helen meet at her royal palace and each is struck by the other's beauty. She calls on him to judge an athletic contest and when asked to sing he does so in praise of her beauty, admitting the purpose of his visit is to win her love. She dismisses him. In despair Paris pleads with her, and she begins to give way. Eventually, through the intervention of Erasto, who reveals himself as Cupid , she gives way, but Pallas Athene (Athena) warns them of sorrow to come. In the final scene Paris and Helen make ready to",

      "text": "Romolo ed Ersilia is a three-act opera composed by Johann Adolph Hasse to an Italian-language libretto by Pietro Metastasio . The opera was commissioned by Empress Maria Theresa to celebrate the marriage of her son Leopold to Maria Luisa of Spain . The opera was first performed on 6 August 1765, the day after their wedding, in the court theatre of the Imperial Palace in Innsbruck . The opera received its first performance in modern times in 2011 during the Innsbruck Festival of Early Music . The opera is loosely based on The Rape of the Sabine Women , an episode in the legendary history of Rome , traditionally dated to 750 BC. The opera's main protagonists are Romolo ( Romulus , the founder and ruler of Rome) and Ersilia ( Hersilia , who became the wife of Romulus). The same libretto was set eight years later by Josef Mysliveček and again titled Romolo ed Ersilia . The libretto also formed the basis for a 1780 ballet d'action choreographed by Charles Le Picq to music by Martín y Soler and entitled Il ratto delle Sabine . An opera entitled Romolo ed Ersilia is the opera seria which is parodied as the \"opera within an opera\" in Donizetti 's Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali .

Orfeo sings of his grief in the famous aria \"Che farò senza Euridice?\"/\"J’ai perdu mon Eurydice\" (\"What shall I do without Euridice?\"/\"I have lost my Euridice\") Orfeo decides he will kill himself to join Euridice in Hades, but Amore returns to stop him (1774 only: Trio: \"Tendre Amour\"). In reward for Orfeo's continued love, Amore returns Euridice to life, and she and Orfeo are reunited. After a four-movement ballet, all sing in praise of Amore (\"Trionfi Amore\"). In the 1774 version, the chorus (\"L’Amour triomphe\") precedes the ballet, to which Gluck had added three extra movements.

Arias Arias from the opera that enjoy an independent concert existence include Paris's minor-key declaration of love, \"O del mio dolce ardor\" (O of my gentle love), in the first act. His second aria is \"Spiagge amate\" (Beloved shores). In the second act, again in a minor key, Paris fears that he may lose Helen in \"Le belle immagini\" (The fair semblance) and in the fourth would prefer death to life without Helen, \"Di te scordarmi, e vivere\" (To forget you and to live). The role of Paris offers difficulties of casting, written, as it was, for a relatively high castrato voice. Arias of Paris have been adapted for tenors , with transposition an octave lower, or appropriated by sopranos and mezzo-sopranos . The aria \"O del mio dolce ardor\" was arranged for orchestra by Tchaikovsky in October 1870. Performance history After the première in the Burgtheater, Vienna, in 1770, there were 25 further performances in Vienna before 1800 (contrasting with more than 100 of his Orfeo ed Euridice and more than 70 of Alceste ).
