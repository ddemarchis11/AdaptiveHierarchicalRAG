      "text": "The John Bice Memorial Oval is a public park in the Australian state of South Australia located within the suburb of Christies Beach and which is used by the Christies Beach Football Club and Southern District Cricket Club as their home ground. History In 1956 the District Council of Noarlunga and, through successful lobbying by the Hon. John Bice , the South Australian Government purchased some land to be set aside as a playing area for the residents of Christies Beach . In 1963 the Christies Beach Football Club took lease of the area and using volunteer labour and community funds, converted the area from a limestone paddock into a turfed oval with mounds and clubrooms. Major events The South Adelaide Football Club played two SANFL league games at the venue in 1992 and 1993, with the first game, against the Glenelg Football Club attracting crowd of over 8,000. The success of these games convinced South Adelaide to relocate to the new Noarlunga Oval in 1995 after playing their home games at the Adelaide Oval (ironically located north of the Adelaide City Centre and the River Torrens ) since 1904, as well as relocating their administration offices and clubrooms from St Marys to the oval. Bice Oval has hosted three Southern Football League Division 1 Grand Finals (1975, 1985 & 2000), 20 Division 2 Grand Finals (1979, 1981–84,",

      "text": "Christies Beach is a seaside suburb in the southern Adelaide metropolitan area, within the City of Onkaparinga . The area is scenic and hence popular  with photographers as Witton Bluff provides a natural vantage point over the entire suburb and beyond. Christies Beach boasts a unique commercial strip running the entire length of Beach Road and is identified as a primary coastal node in the Adelaide Metropolitan area (Planning SA, 2007). Christies Beach also features one of the few remaining main road classified Esplanades in Metropolitan Adelaide, providing direct access to the beach on Gulf St Vincent . Christies Beach has its own postcode of 5165, and is adjacent to the suburbs of Christie Downs and Noarlunga Centre to the east, Port Noarlunga to the south, and O'Sullivan Beach to the north. Offshore from Christies Beach is Horseshoe Reef, which is exposed at low tide. A new artificial subtidal reef was constructed approximately 500 metres offshore from the mouth of Christies Creek in 2021. Development The very first development to occur along the coast of Christies Beach can be traced back to pre-colonization times, almost 40,000 years ago.  The indigenous Kaurna people used the coastal area of Christies Beach (at the time known as Mullawirratingga) as a place for seasonal residence. They constructed structures known as a wodli , which are small shelters made of branches and leaves.",

      "text": "This is when Rosa Christie created the first subdivision in the area, it was named Christie Beach. With this subdivision and other such residential allocations in the area road and rail transportation was improved. The improvement in transportation south of Adelaide gave Christies Beach an increase in tourists and holiday makers who were looking for a coastal experience. Many tourists decided to build cottages and holiday shacks on Witton Bluff and down onto the beach itself (City of Onkaparinga, 2005). Beach Road commercial district looking up from the beach With the influx of visitors and new residents to the area the Christies Beach Progressive Association was formed to provide good foreshore amenities, such as beach access, toilets, showers, etc. Foreshore developments led to the creation of new shops and services on the Esplanade and nearby Gulfview and Beach Roads. By the late 1950s demand for residence in the area skyrocketed, this propelled commercial and industrial developments in the Lonsdale district with the opening of Port Stanvac Oil Refinery and Chrysler (later Mitsubishi ) engine plant and also in Noarlunga with the relocation of the railway line and the construction of Colonnades Shopping Centre (Colwell, 1972) (City of Onkaparinga, 2005). Christie Beach Post Office opened on 3 April 1945 and was renamed Christies Beach around 1961. Christies Beach North office opened on 5 June 1962. Wastewater treatment",

There are plans for a coastal trail from Christies Beach to Port Noarlunga, called The Witton Bluff Base Trail, with the application for funding being considered. Sport The central sporting hub for the Christies Beach area is the John Bice Memorial Oval , home of the Christies Beach Football Club , Southern Districts Cricket Club and the Christies Beach Sports and Social Club. At the waterfront, the Christies Beach Sailing Club and Christies Beach Surf Lifesaving Club cater for participants in aquatic sports. A small concrete boat ramp exists for launching and landing watercraft.
