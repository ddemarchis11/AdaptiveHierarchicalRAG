This stop was opened on 20 September 2010 and has step-free access. The stop is located at street-level. It is on the north side of Salford Quays, adjacent to Dock 9 and the Manchester Ship Canal (border between Salford and Trafford ). Serving MediaCityUK, it is also near to The Lowry , other parts of Salford Quays , and Imperial War Museum North (though there is a different tram stop on the Trafford Park Line serving it closer). History A now retired T68 tram arriving at MediaCityUK in May 2011. MediaCityUK is a development within Salford Quays , on the site of the former Manchester Docks . When an active port, the quays were served by numerous railway goods lines. The Metrolink's extension to Salford Quays was part of an urban renewal project for the area around the Manchester Ship Canal . Plans for a light rail system in this area have existed since around 1987, initially as far as Broadway ; the proposals evolved and included a possible branch line to serve the Lowry. The MediaCityUK spur replaced that proposal. The stop opened on 20 September 2010 at the end of a 360-metre spur",

The museum was renamed the Churchill War Rooms in 2010. Imperial War Museum North Entrance of Imperial War Museum North in Manchester The Imperial War Museum North was opened in Trafford , Greater Manchester , in 2002. It was the first branch of the museum outside southeast England, and the first to be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind , with Manchester-based architects Leach Rhodes Walker providing implementation services, The Imperial War Museum North was Libeskind's first building in Britain. Libeskind's building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays , was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings , a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5 million.

Planning and construction The entrance During the 1990s, the Imperial War Museum sought to open a branch in the north of England. Seventy-one sites were offered for consideration by 36 local councils. One such council was that of Hartlepool , in County Durham , for whom a new museum building was designed by architect Sir Norman Foster for a site on Hartlepool's dockside. In 1992 the Teesside Development Corporation offered the museum, on behalf of Hartlepool council, a total of £14.4 million towards construction and running costs. However, the National Audit Office later reported that the corporation's offer breached government rules and negotiations were abandoned. View from the museum's air shard viewing platform; The Lowry opposite the museum in Salford , across the Manchester Ship Canal . In January 1999 the then Culture Secretary Chris Smith launched a project to construct the new museum in Trafford , Greater Manchester . The Trafford Park area has strong associations with the Second World War on the British home front ; factories in the area produced Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines used by a number of Royal Air Force combat aircraft. By 1945 the area employed 75,000 people. The area was consequently heavily bombed, particularly during the Manchester Blitz , when 684 people were killed in raids over two",

      "text": "Imperial War Museum North (sometimes referred to as IWM North ) is a museum in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester , England. One of five branches of the Imperial War Museum , it explores the impact of modern conflicts on people and society. It is the first branch of the Imperial War Museum to be located in the north of England. The museum occupies a site overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal on Trafford Wharf Road, Trafford Park , an area which during World War II was a key industrial centre and consequently heavily bombed during the Manchester Blitz in 1940. The area is now home to the Lowry cultural centre and the MediaCityUK development, which stand opposite the museum at Salford Quays . The museum building was designed by architect Daniel Libeskind and opened in July 2002, receiving 470,000 visitors in its first year of opening. It was recognised with awards or prize nominations for its architecture and is a prime example of Deconstructivist architecture. The museum features a permanent exhibition of chronological and thematic displays, supported by hourly audiovisual presentations which are projected throughout the gallery space. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions in a separate gallery. Since opening, the museum has operated a successful volunteer programme, which since January 2007 has been run in partnership with Manchester Museum .

Trams usually depart MediaCityUK heading towards Manchester about 10 minutes before another tram to Manchester departs from Imperial War Museum. Since the Trafford Park Line is a little faster than the Eccles Line , it makes for a potentially faster way to get to the city centre than just waiting for the next tram at MediaCityUK. Transport connections Bus MediaCityUK tram stop is served closest by Bee Network bus routes 29, 30, 50, 51, 53, and 79 on The Quays (road), the most frequent being route 50 ( East Didsbury -MediaCityUK).

The track singles for the MediaCityUK branch, and a tram was departing MediaCityUK heading to Harbour City (towards Manchester) at this time, which meant it had to use a crossover track to enter the correct platform.

It operates as a deep-level subway in Downtown Pittsburgh , but runs mostly at-grade in the suburbs south of the city. The system is largely linear in a north–south direction, with one terminus near Pittsburgh's central business district and two termini in the South Hills . The system is owned and operated by Pittsburgh Regional Transit . The T is one of the surviving first-generation streetcar systems in North America , with the oldest portions of the network dating back to 1903 and the Pittsburgh Railways . It is also one of only three light rail systems in the United States that continues to use the broad 5 ft 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1,588 mm ) Pennsylvania trolley gauge on its lines instead of the 4 ft 8 + 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard gauge . In 2024, the system had a ridership of 3,236,100. History Overview In the early 1960s, Pittsburgh had the largest surviving streetcar system in the United States, with the privately owned Pittsburgh Railways Company operating more than 600 PCC cars on 41 routes. In 1964 the system was acquired by the Port Authority of Allegheny County , which rapidly converted most",
