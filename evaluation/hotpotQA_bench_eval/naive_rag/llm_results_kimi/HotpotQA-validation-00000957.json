      "text": "Triumph the Insult Comic Dog is a puppet character created, puppeteered, and voiced by actor/comedian/director Robert Smigel . As his name indicates, Triumph's comedic style is almost exclusively insult comedy . A Rottweiler & Montenegrin Mountain Hound ,  Triumph often is seen with a cigar in his mouth, which usually falls out when he starts talking. He first appeared in 1997 on NBC 's Late Night with Conan O'Brien , and also appeared on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien from time to time, as well as the short-lived TV Funhouse , TBS 's Conan , Adult Swim 's The Jack and Triumph Show , The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , The Daily Show , and Hollywood Squares . Smigel and Triumph have been ejected from several events for Triumph's antics, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show , the Honolulu line for auditions for American Idol , and the 2004 Democratic National Convention (while shooting an aborted movie project).

      "text": "The Jack and Triumph Show is a television sitcom from Universal Television for Adult Swim that premiered on February 20, 2015, and ended on April 3, 2015, with a total of 7 episodes. The live-action series was created by Robert Smigel , Michael Koman , and David Feldman . The series features Jack McBrayer playing Jack Mlicki, the former child star of a fictional Lassie -like series. The puppet Triumph the Insult Comic Dog represents his co-star from that series. The series was initially picked up for 20 episodes, but when only 7 episodes had aired, in August 2015 Dino Stamatopoulos confirmed that it would not be returning. Plot The show is about two former child actors (Jack McBrayer and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog) who starred in a Lassie -like show from the 1980s and 1990s called Triumph's Boy . Jack had grown up playing the role of the small boy in the series even as he grew into adulthood. Though he is kind-hearted and optimistic, being a child actor had led to Jack being sheltered, naive, and socially awkward. After their show's cancellation, Jack and Triumph lived an indulgent and morally questionable lifestyle with the money they had made from the show. However, when Jack finds out that his parents had squandered all his earnings, he and Triumph are forced into a life of thievery and prostitution.",
