      "text": "Aliens of the Deep is a 2005 American documentary film directed in part by James Cameron alongside fellow cameraman and friend Steven Quale , who served as second unit director on Cameron's Titanic (1997) and later Avatar (2009), and filmed in the IMAX 3D format. It was produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures . Cameron teams with NASA scientists to explore the mid-ocean ridges , submerged chains of mountains in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that are home to some of the planet's more unusual forms of life. It was released on DVD on November 1, 2005. Plot Cameron joins up aboard the Russian research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh with a group of NASA scientists, as well as some American marine biologists , to investigate ten hydrothermal vents in both the Atlantic and Pacific. The vents have their own unique ecosystem , which support diverse organisms such as giant tube worms , swarms of blind white crabs, and vast amounts of shrimp which are capable of \"seeing\" water that is heated by the vents. These creatures do not require sunlight like other organisms, and instead obtain their energy from the vents. They are able to survive in the superheated and sulfurous water. Because of this, the documentary suggests that this is what life beyond Earth might look like. As some alien ecosystems are likely to be a lot harsher than a typical terrestrial ecosystem, these exotic vents provide an insight into some of",

As some alien ecosystems are likely to be a lot harsher than a typical terrestrial ecosystem, these exotic vents provide an insight into some of the forms that alien life might take. The documentary shows Cameron's passion for exploring the oceans, as well as his interest in extraterrestrial life. It also showcases the technology employed to reach such depths. The film is similar to Cameron's earlier documentary, Ghosts of the Abyss (2003), which involves him journeying to the wreck of the RMS Titanic . It too was filmed in the 3-D IMAX format.

      "text": "Poetry in Motion is a 1982 Canadian documentary film directed by Ron Mann featuring contemporary North American poetry and music. Featured are some of the Black Mountain poets , Beats , minimalist poets , and avant-garde poets. It was released in theaters, later being distributed on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD. An extended CD-ROM version was also released. Production Poetry in Motion is Mann's second feature film after Imagine the Sound . While watching John Giorno and William S. Burroughs at a rock club, Mann discovered Giorno's Dial-A-Poem recordings during a break in the performance. The director later decided to create an anthology of \"post-Beat\" poets for a film. His idea was based on the poem anthology publication The New American Poetry 1945–1960 by Donald Allen . The first poet to say that they were interested in being in the film was Allen Ginsberg . Almost 40 poets performed more than 75 poems, and filmmaker Emile de Antonio helped cut down the filmed material to 90 minutes long. The film is interspersed with parts of an interview with Charles Bukowski . Performers include Allen Ginsberg, Kenward Elmslie , and Anne Waldman . A CD-ROM version was released with poems which were never in the film. All 47 hours of footage are held at the Art Gallery of Ontario . Release The film was originally released in theaters.

Reception A review in the book Of-Hollywood Movies says, \"If you aren't a student of contemporary poetry, Poetry in Motion serves as an excellent introduction. If you are, it's orgasmic\". The film has been criticized for including only four Canadian poets, but proponents stated that \"the film is a new genre that elides criticism based in nationalism\".
