      "text": "Eriogonum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae . The genus is found in North America and is known as wild buckwheat . This is a highly species-rich genus, and indications are that active speciation is continuing. It includes some common wildflowers , such as the California buckwheat ( Eriogonum fasciculatum ). The genus derived its name from the Greek word erion meaning 'wool' and gonu meaning 'knee or joint'. The author of the genus, Michaux , explained the name as describing the first named species of the genus ( E. tomentosum ) as a wooly plant with sharply bent stems ( \"planta lanata, geniculata\" ). Despite sharing the common name \"buckwheat\", Eriogonum is part of a different genus from the cultivated European buckwheat and than other plant species also called wild buckwheat . In addition to the widespread common species, approximately a third of the species in the genus are rare, endangered, or threatened. One such species came into the news in 2005 when the Mount Diablo buckwheat ( Eriogonum truncatum , believed to be extinct) was rediscovered. Ecology Eriogonum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). An example of a butterfly that uses this plant for food is the",

      "text": "known as the People's Grocery lynching . This act sparked a national outcry. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church, Reverend W. Gaines called for the crowd to sing the then de facto national anthem, \" My Country, 'Tis of Thee ,\" but the call was refused, one member of the audience declaring, \"I don't want to sing that song until this country is what it claims to be, 'sweet land of liberty'\". The Reverend substituted the Civil War-era song about the abolitionist martyr, \" John Brown's Body \". Well's husband, Ferdinand L. Barnett , closed the meeting appealing for calm and a careful response, but also expressing great frustration and concern that the violence against blacks may one day lead to reprisals. Early 20th century Emma Goldman was imprisoned for two years after opposing conscription in the US during World War I. Refusal to stand during the national anthem became a widespread form of protest during World War I . In some cases, this was related to protest of conscription . Newspapers at the time associated the protests with support for socialism , Bolshevism , or communism . In one case, supporters of anarchist Emma Goldman refused to stand for the national anthem. The act of protest was very controversial, and many people were highly offended, so that even accidentally remaining seated could result in violence. Protests during the anthem continued after World War I. For example, during the",
