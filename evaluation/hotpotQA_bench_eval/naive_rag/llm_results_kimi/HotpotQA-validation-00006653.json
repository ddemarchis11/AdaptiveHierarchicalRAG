Tafo is the thirtieth most populous settlement in Ghana, in terms of population, with a population of 60,919 people. Because of the town's population and housing development in recent years, it is debatable whether Tafo is still regarded as a separate town, or already a suburb of Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti region. The town is near Kumasi, with a distance of approximately 3.3 kilometers to the center of a similar name sounding village named New Tafo and must be distinguished from Tafo (However per traditional/kingship administrative system new Tafo and Old Tafo are basically run by a single Chief who happens to be the leader of the left wing of Kumasi Traditional council. Its therefore under same authority but political administration runs them separately. Nana Tafohene is the Chief of both Tafo which comprises the two). Tarkwa is located just 4.6 km away from Tafo. The city center of Kumasi is located approximately 9.8 kilometers away. Tafo is one of the urban constituencies of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly . The town's parliamentary candidate shall have one direct seat to the Parliament of Ghana . History Tafo is also due to its history of a regional headquarters of Ashanti-King, the Tafohene.

The popular Ghana Gold fields mine is located in the region at Tarkwa. Education The Western region has many post-secondary schools, including teachers' and nursing colleges, and two universities-- University of Mines and Technology (in Tarkwa) and Takoradi Technical University (formerly known as Takoradi Polytechnic). Administrative divisions Before the regional demarcation in December 2018 , the region had 23 MMDA's (made up of 1 Metropolitan, 11 Municipal and 11 Ordinary Assemblies). Therefore, as part of this reorganisation, nine MMDA's (those in bold and asterisks below, which were 3 Municipal and 6 Ordinary Assemblies) were removed from the Western region and formed into a new Western North region with its new capital at Wiawso . The political administration of the region is through the local government system. Under this administration system, the region is divided into 14 MMDA's (made up of 1 Metropolitan, 8 Municipal and 5 Ordinary Assemblies). Each District , Municipal or Metropolitan Assembly, is administered by a Chief Executive, representing the central government but deriving authority from an Assembly headed by a presiding member elected from among the members themselves.
