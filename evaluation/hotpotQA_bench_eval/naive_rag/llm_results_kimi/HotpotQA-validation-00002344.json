Each lawmaker represents single member districts across the state. The powers of the legislature are granted under Article III of the Constitution of Hawaii . The legislature convenes at the Hawaii State Capitol building in the state capital of Honolulu , on the island of Oahu . History The legislature is a descendant of the two houses of the parliament for the Kingdom of Hawaii , the Legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom , created in the 1840 Constitution of the Kingdom and continued in the subsequent 1852 Constitution as the Legislature of the Hawaiian Islands, consisting of the House of Representatives (Hawaiian Kingdom) and the House of Nobles . Following the overthrow and fall of the Kingdom of Hawai‘i in 1894 this Legislature became the legislative body of the briefly established Republic of Hawaii , and shortly afterwards under the newly organized Territory of Hawaii following the annexation by the United States in 1898. The current Hawaii State Legislature was created following the passage of the Hawaii Admission Act by the United States Congress in 1959 when the Territory of Hawaii was admitted to the Union as the 50th State.

It is a bicameral institution consisting of the 40-member Alaska House of Representatives ( lower house ) and the 20-member Alaska Senate ( upper house ). There are 40 House Districts (1–40) and 20 Senate Districts (A–T). With a total of 60 lawmakers, the Alaska State Legislature is the smallest bicameral state legislature in the United States and the second-smallest of all state legislatures (only the 49-member unicameral Nebraska Legislature is smaller). State representatives are elected by ranked-choice voting . There are no term limits for either chamber. The Alaska State Legislature meets in the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau . The current meeting, since January 21, 2025 is the 34th Alaska State Legislature . The previous meeting, 33rd Alaska State Legislature , met from 2023 to 2025. Before that, the 32nd Alaska State Legislature , met from 2021 to 2023. Organization Non-professional legislature Unlike other state legislatures with longer sessions, the Alaska State Legislature's comparatively short session allows many lawmakers to retain outside employment, especially in the state's many seasonal industries , such as fishing and tourism . In this, the Alaska State Legislature retains some of the volunteer nature that characterized most state legislatures until the middle of the 20th century.

Composition The Democrats have controlled the chamber since 1963, and have held a supermajority since 1984. From 2016 (when Sen. Sam Slom , Hawaii's sole Republican state Senator, was defeated in his bid for reelection) to 2018, the Democratic Party held all 25 seats in the Hawaii Senate. This made the Hawaii Senate the only state legislative chamber with no opposition members (this excludes the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature ). It was the first time since 1980 (when both the Alabama Senate and Louisiana Senate were all-Democratic) that any state legislative chamber had been completely dominated by a single party.
