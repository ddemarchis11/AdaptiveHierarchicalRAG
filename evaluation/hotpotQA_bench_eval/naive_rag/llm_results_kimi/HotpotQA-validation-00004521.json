Spencer played and recorded with Gibson Bros., Boss Hog and The Honeymoon Killers prior to the formation of the Blues Explosion. Judah Bauer, from Appleton, Wisconsin , had been in an early line-up of The Spitters, and with Russell Simins, from Queens, New York , recorded as part of Crowbar Massage. It was with Jerry Teel's Honeymoon Killers that Bauer, Simins and Spencer would all perform and record and from which they would go on to form The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. Russell and I would rehearse with Honeymoon Killers and the rehearsal would be over and Russell and I would keep playing, eventually inviting Simins' friend Bauer to join in. The sound of The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion was informed by previous bands with influence taken from working with the Gibson Bros. which was already evident in the last Pussy Galore album. \"That final Pussy Galore album exuded a very Gibson Brothers-bent version of what was to come with Spencer's next, more successful venture the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.\" \"...after five years of Pussy Galore I was able to connect to rock ’n’ roll in some way that I wasn't able to before,\" he remembers those formative days. \"I was pissed off about a lot of things...so much shitty rock ’n’ roll that angered me, and Pussy Galore",

      "text": "The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion was an American three-piece rock band from New York City , formed in 1991. The group consisted of Judah Bauer on guitar, backing vocals , harmonica and occasional lead vocals , Russell Simins on drums and Jon Spencer on vocals , guitar and theremin . Their musical style is largely rooted in rock and roll ; however, the band draws influences from punk , blues , garage , rockabilly , soul , noise rock , rhythm and blues and hip-hop . The band released nine official studio albums, collaborative records with Dub Narcotic Sound System and R.L. Burnside as well as numerous live, singles, out-take albums, compilations, remix albums. In 2010, the band released a series of expanded reissues. Throughout the course of their career, this experimental sound and occasionally unconventional recording techniques has allowed the band to work with such artists as Elliott Smith , Beck , Solomon Burke , Steve Albini , Martina Topley-Bird , and Mike D of the Beastie Boys . History Formation Originally from Hanover, New Hampshire , US, Jon Spencer attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island where he was part of the noise rock band Shithaus, with Tod Ashley ( Cop Shoot Cop , Firewater ).

The band made a music video for the song \"Rachel\" directed by Jim Spring and Jens Jurgensen which was later issued by Matador Records on the 1997 Live Promo Video . The first album by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion was the only one to be issued by Caroline Records . In 1992, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion inked a deal with Caroline Records and requested a very specific signing bonus-- the then-new 10xCD Jerry Lee Lewis box set. As band lore has it, Caroline never sprang for the set, and the Blues Explosion's tenure there was short-lived and acrimonious. The first single release was \"Shirt Jac\" on In The Red Records (1992) also from the second recording session with Steve Albini. This was the first of the Explosion Juke Box Series singles inspired by \"a similar series of Charlie Feathers released in the 70s\" (the third single in the series, \"Get With It\", was actually an arrangement of a Feathers single from 1956). The b-side \"Latch On\" is a Jon Spencer arrangement of a rockabilly song despite the fact that The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recording has very little in common with the most well-known recordings of this track (released by Ron Hargrave and The Cochran Brothers ).",

The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion version is more than likely a cover of the Cochran Brothers version of this song as both tracks feature the words \"you are really gone\" which do not appear in the lyrics sung by Ron Hargrave. Extra Width (1993–1994) When the band signed with Matador Records they \"asked for the 9xCD Stax-Volt Complete Singles 1959–1968...Matador made good with Stax, and the band enjoyed a decade-long partnership with the label\". In late 1992 Jon Spencer Blues Explosion embarked on a long tour in the US supporting the Jesus Lizard . Frank Kozik designed posters for shows at Emo's, Austin, Texas and Kennel Club, San Francisco. Recording sessions for the Extra Width , The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's second studio album, took place in Memphis at Doug Easleys studio on November 23/24 and December 3, 1992 during the Jesus Lizard tour and at Waterworks Recording in New York with Jim Waters where all further overdubs and mixing was done. The album graphic design copies a package of panty hose purchased in Memphis, Tennessee. The original panty hose packaging can be seen in a band photo used on Mo' Width and the later reissues of Extra Width . It is said that",
