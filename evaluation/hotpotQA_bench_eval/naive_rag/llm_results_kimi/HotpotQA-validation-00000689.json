      "text": "Ghostkeeper is a 1981 Canadian supernatural slasher film directed by James Makichuk , and starring Riva Spier, Georgie Collins , and Murray Ord. Its plot centers on a trio of snowmobilers in the Canadian Rockies who become stranded at an abandoned hotel where the elderly female innkeeper is hiding an evil entity within the building. The film is inspired by the Windigo legend of North America. Filmed in Banff, Alberta under a tax shelter in December 1980, the film had an unstable financial situation and the filmmakers nearly halted the production mid-way through due to depletion of its budget. The film was given a brief theatrical release in Canada and was released directly to video in the United States by New World Pictures . It has attained a cult following in the years since its release. The independent cult label Code Red Releasing later acquired the film, and released on DVD for the first time in April 2012. In August 2017, they reissued the film on Blu-ray featuring a new 2K scan of the original film elements. Plot Jenny, Marty, and Chrissy are spending their New Year's Eve on a snowmobiling trip in the Rocky Mountains . After talking with a storekeeper at a ski shop, the three decide to go riding before dark, but end up caught in a blizzard. Looming before them is a seemingly abandoned hotel at the top of the snow trail, isolated from tourists and miles away from the skiing area.",

Early on in the development process, the filmmakers chose the Deer Lodge, a winter hotel in Banff, Alberta as the primary filming location. For the film's antagonist, filmmakers drew inspiration from the Native American legend of the Wendigo , a cannibalistic spirit that possessed humans, roaming the wilderness in search of human flesh. According to Makichuk, the Wendigo was originally intended to have a more substantial role in the film, but many scenes had to be removed due to budget restraints. Casting The majority of the cast were locally-hired actors in the Calgary area, with the exception being lead Riva Spier, who was an actress hired out of Montreal . For the majority of the cast, Ghostkeeper was their first and final film credit; Georgie Collins was primarily a well-known stage actress in Calgary, and was cast in the role of the mysterious elderly hotel proprietor. Spier, who had previously starred in minor roles prior to the film, would later go on to have a successful voice acting career. John MacMillan, who stood 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) in stature, was cast in the role of the Windigo. Filming Deer Lodge in Banff, Alberta served",

The performances are a notch above those being offered in much of the American horror fare being served up in our theaters.\" John Brooker of the Staines Informer was unimpressed by the film, noting a \"plodding pace which will satisfy only undemanding horror fans.\" Of contemporary reviews, the horror film website The Terror Trap gave the film a positive review stating, \"Not for all tastes, the methodically paced Ghostkeeper is an exercise in disciplined mood generation; its bare claustrophobia either works for the viewer or not. But for those who prefer their chills straightforward, pre-sneer and pre-sarcasm, Keeper can be a most rewarding snow trap\". J. A. Kerswell from Hysteria Lives! gave the film a negative review calling the film \"flawed\", and \"muddled\". In The Blockbuster Entertainment Guide to Movies and Videos (1999), the film was rated two-and-a-half stars out of five, deemed \"an absurd thriller.\" Eric Cotenas of DVD Drive-In noted the film's prominent atmosphere and drew comparisons to Stephen King 's The Shining as well as cinematographer John Holbrook's \"aesthetic response to the desolate location.\" See also Folklore of the United States Wendigo Notes References Sources Blockbuster (1998).

      "text": "Wendigo ( / ˈ w ɛ n d ɪ ɡ oʊ / ) is a mythological creature or evil spirit originating from Algonquian folklore. The concept of the wendigo has been widely used in literature and other works of art, such as social commentary and horror fiction . The wendigo is often said to be a malevolent spirit, sometimes depicted as a creature with human-like characteristics, who may possess human beings. It is said to cause its victims a feeling of insatiable hunger , the desire to eat other humans , and the propensity to commit murder. In some representations, the wendigo is described as a giant humanoid with a heart of ice, whose approach is signaled by a foul stench or sudden unseasonable chill. In modern psychiatry , the disorder known as \"Wendigo psychosis \" is characterized by symptoms such as an intense craving for human flesh and fear of becoming a cannibal. Wendigo psychosis is described as a culture-bound syndrome . In some First Nations communities, symptoms such as insatiable greed and destruction of the environment are also thought to be symptoms of wendigo psychosis. The wechuge is a similar being that appears in the legends of the Athabaskan people of the Northwest Pacific Coast . It too is cannibalistic; however, it is characterized as enlightened with ancestral insights. Etymology The contemporary English word wendigo is a loanword from multiple origins. It",
