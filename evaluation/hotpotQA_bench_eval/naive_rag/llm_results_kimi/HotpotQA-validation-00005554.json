Established by the United States Army Air Corps as an Advanced Flying School in June 1941, it was closed at the end of World War II . It was again activated as a training base by the United States Air Force with the outbreak of the Korean War in November 1950.

The base was closed at the end of the Cold War following a decision by the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission and is now the site of the Southern California Logistics Airport . Since 2009, the California Air National Guard 's 196th Reconnaissance Squadron (96 RS) has operated an MQ-1 Predator Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) training facility at the site.

It took place on November 3, 2007 at the site of the now-closed George Air Force Base (currently used as Southern California Logistics Airport ), in Victorville, California ( Google map ), in the West of the United States. Discovery's Science channel followed a few of the teams and covered the Urban Challenge in its Robocars Archived 2008-07-30 at the Wayback Machine series. Overview The $2 million winner was Tartan Racing, a collaborative effort by Carnegie Mellon University and General Motors Corporation, with their vehicle \"Boss\", a heavily modified Chevrolet Tahoe . The second-place finisher earning the $1 million prize was the Stanford Racing Team with their entry \"Junior\", a 2006 Volkswagen Passat . Coming in third place was team Victor Tango from Virginia Tech winning the $500,000 prize with their 2005 Ford Escape hybrid, \"Odin\". The course involved a 96 kilometres (60 mi) urban area course, to be completed in less than 6 hours . Rules included obeying all traffic regulations while negotiating with other traffic and obstacles and merging into traffic. While the 2004 and 2005 events were more physically challenging for the vehicles , the robots operated in isolation and did not encounter other vehicles on the course, the Urban Challenge required designers to build vehicles",

ARCO was known for sponsoring the ARCO Arena (now Sleep Train Arena ) in Sacramento, California , with a license fee of $750,000/year through 2007. On August 13, 2012, it was announced that Tesoro would purchase ARCO and its refinery for $2.5 billion. The deal came under fire because of increasing fuel prices. Many activists urged state and federal regulators to block the sale because of concerns that it would reduce competition and could lead to higher fuel prices at ARCO stations (ARCO stations make up more than half of all stations with the lowest fuel prices in California). On June 3, 2013, BP sold ARCO and the Carson Refinery to Tesoro for $2.5 billion. BP sold its Southern California terminals (Vinvale, Colton, San Diego, Hathaway, and Hynes) to Tesoro Logistics LP, including the Carson Storage Facility. BP sold the ampm brand to Tesoro for Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada. BP exclusively licensed the ARCO rights from Tesoro for Northern California, Oregon, and Washington. ARCO is known for its low-priced gasoline compared to other national brands, mainly because of an early 1980s business decision to emphasize cost cutting (cash/debit-only policy) and alternative sources of income (ampm).
