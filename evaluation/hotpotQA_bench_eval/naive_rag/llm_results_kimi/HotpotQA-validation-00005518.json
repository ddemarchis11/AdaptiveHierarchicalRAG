      "text": "Vinylmation is a brand of 1.5\", 3\", and 9\" vinyl collectible toys sold at Disney theme parks , select Disney Stores , and the online Disney Store. The name Vinylmation is a combination of the word Animation and Vinyl . Most figures are all shaped with the body of Mickey Mouse but have different themed markings, colors, and patterns. This means that all figures have round mouse ears, whether or not the painted character has them. This is accommodated by painting the ears with backgrounds - stars, stripes, rainbows - to match the painted character. The series exception is the Park Starz series which does not resemble Mickey at all, and more closely resembles iconic figures from the parks. Vinylmation was first introduced in July 2008, and the first figures were introduced in November 2008. After a surge of releases between 2010 and 2014, the toy line began to decline around 2015, and ceased production until a 2022 revival.

A web app is now [ when? ] available where Vinylmation collectors can go to organize their collections, get detailed information about every Vinylmation made to date, trade their Vinylmation, and buy Vinylmation. Vinylmation figurines are tradeable through friends, clubs, or other owners of Vinylmation figurines. At some locations, old or dulled figurines can be traded for new figurines. Packaging Vinylmation figures are sold in sealed packaging. The purchaser does not know which figure they are buying until they have opened it. Each figure belongs to a series of 8, 12, or 24. All of the figures in a series are printed on the packaging and the series itself comes in a large box on display at the point of purchase. Each series has one unknown figure, called \"the chaser.\" Some figures come with cards, stickers, or another figure to make a set. In addition to being a mystery figure, the chaser is also one of the rarer figures in each series. However, in addition to the chaser, there are also variants which are randomly inserted into cases at a lower rate than the chaser. The variant is a different version of one of the vinyls in the series. Limited edition nine-inch figures are also sold and these are visible without opening the packaging. There is also a 1.5-inch Vinylmation Jr. size.",

      "text": "Bosko is an animated cartoon character created by animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising . Bosko was the first recurring character in Leon Schlesinger 's cartoon series and was the star of 39 Looney Tunes shorts released by Warner Bros. He was voiced by Carman Maxwell , Bernard B. Brown , Johnny Murray , and Philip Hurlic during the 1920s and 1930s and once by Don Messick during the 1990s. The character would briefly appear in shorts released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer prior to his retirement; the rights to the character and the Looney Tunes -era films are owned by Turner Entertainment Co. through separate acquisitions; the latter have fallen into the public domain due to their copyrights not being renewed after rights disputes. Creation and the first film In 1927, Harman and Ising worked for the Walt Disney Studios on a series of live-action/animated short subjects known as the Alice Comedies . The two animators created Bosko in 1928 to capitalize on the recent success of talkies in the motion picture industry. They began thinking about making a sound cartoon with Bosko in 1928 even prior to their departure from Walt Disney . Hugh Harman made drawings of the new character and registered it with the U.S. Copyright Office on January 3, 1928. The character was registered as a \" Negro boy\" under the name of Bosko.

      "text": "The Crazy Castle series is a platform game series created by Kemco and released on the Famicom Disk System , Nintendo Entertainment System , Game Boy , Game Boy Color , and Game Boy Advance . It stars different popular cartoon characters, most notably the Warner Bros. cartoon character Bugs Bunny , the Walt Disney cartoon character Mickey Mouse and the Universal cartoon character Woody Woodpecker . History Kemco started the franchise after they licensed the rights to produce a Famicom Disk System game based on the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit . When Kemco was planning to release it outside Japan, there was already an NES game based on the same film developed by Rare and published by LJN . Licensing issues occurring in Western markets, as Capcom owned rights to release Disney-based video games outside Japan at the time, had also been cited as a factor. In order to release the game outside Japan, Kemco bought the rights to Warner Bros. ' Looney Tunes franchise to produce Looney Tunes -based video games. When the promotion of the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit in Japan ended, Kemco lost the rights to produce video games based on the film there, but gained the rights to produce Disney -based ones, due to the Who Framed Roger Rabbit film being produced by Touchstone Pictures , a studio owned by The Walt Disney Company. Kemco later produced their Mickey Mouse versions in the Crazy Castle series and released most of these versions exclusively in Japan, while continuing their Looney Tunes versions outside",

Inspired by such silent film personalities as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks , Mickey is traditionally portrayed as a sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges bigger than himself. The character's depiction as a small mouse is personified through his diminutive stature and falsetto voice, the latter of which was originally provided by Walt Disney. Though originally characterized as a cheeky lovable rogue , Mickey was rebranded over time as a nice guy , usually seen as a spirited, yet impulsive hero . Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable fictional characters, often described as a global cultural icon. He also appears in media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the Disney parks. Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film , one of which, Lend a Paw , won the award in 1941 . In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . Creation The earliest known concept art of Mickey and Minnie Mouse from early 1928, largely attributed to Ub Iwerks , but speculated to include work from Walt Disney or Les Clark ; The Walt Disney Family Museum collection Mickey Mouse was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , an earlier cartoon character that was created by the Disney studio but owned",
