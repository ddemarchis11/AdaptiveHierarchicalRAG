O'Donnell and Ephron lived in the same apartment building while filming Sleepless in Seattle , which Ephron had obtained for her. Hanks' wife Rita Wilson originally auditioned for the role of Becky, but Ephron preferred her for the role of Sam's sister Suzy, which the director found particularly convenient because Wilson was already in Seattle with her husband. Ephron cast Rob Reiner , who directed When Harry Met Sally ..., as Sam's friend in the film, with Reiner contributing to many of the film's laughs.
