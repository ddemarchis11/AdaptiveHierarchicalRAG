At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine Muscle & Fitness . Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present Shape , Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine. Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy.

Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1987. Weider was purchased by American Media in 2002. A German version of Shape is available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The magazine is also edited in Romania. Elizabeth Goodman Artis was named Editor-in-Chief in 2014 and held the position until 2021.
