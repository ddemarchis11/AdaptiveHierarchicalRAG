      "text": "L'amour des trois oranges , Op. 33, is a 1921 satirical French-language opera by Sergei Prokofiev . He wrote his own libretto, basing it on the Italian play L'amore delle tre melarance , or The Love for Three Oranges (Russian: Любовь к трём апельсинам Lyubov k tryom apyelsinam ) by Carlo Gozzi , and conducted the premiere, which took place at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago on 30 December 1921. History Composition The opera resulted from a commission during Prokofiev's first visit to the United States in 1918. After well-received concerts of his works in Chicago, including his First Symphony , Prokofiev was approached by the director of the Chicago Opera Association , Cleofonte Campanini , to write an opera. Conveniently the composer had already drafted a libretto during his voyage to America, one based on Gozzi's Italian play in mock commedia dell'arte style (itself an adaptation of Giambattista Basile 's fairy tale ). He had done so using Vsevolod Meyerhold 's Russian translation of the Gozzi and had injected a dose of Surrealism into the commedia dell'arte mix. But Russian would have been unacceptable to an American audience, and Prokofiev's English was scanty,",

Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev— Chout , Le pas d'acier and The Prodigal Son —which, at the time of their original production, all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. But Prokofiev's greatest interest was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel . Prokofiev's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges , composed for the Chicago Opera and performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia. After the Revolution of 1917 , Prokofiev left Russia with the approval of Soviet People's Commissar Anatoly Lunacharsky , and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, pianist and conductor. In 1923 he married a Spanish singer, Carolina (Lina) Codina , with whom he had two sons; they divorced in 1947. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev's ballets and operas to be staged in America and Western Europe. Prokofiev, who regarded himself as a composer foremost, resented the time taken by touring as a pianist, and increasingly turned to the",

Sontsovka, now known by Sontsivka, is part of present-day Pokrovsk Raion in the Donetsk Oblast of Ukraine . His father, Sergei Alekseyevich Prokofiev, was an agronomist from a mercantile family in Moscow . Prokofiev's mother, Maria ( née Zhitkova ), came from a Saint Petersburg family of former serfs who had been owned by the Sheremetev family, under whose patronage serf-children were taught theatre and arts from an early age. She was described by Reinhold Glière , Prokofiev's first composition teacher, as \"a tall woman with beautiful, clever eyes … who knew how to create an atmosphere of warmth and simplicity about her.\" After their wedding in the summer of 1877, the Prokofievs moved to a small estate in the Smolensk governorate. Eventually, Sergei Alekseyevich found employment as a soil engineer, employed by one of his former fellow-students, Dmitri Sontsov, to whose estate in the Ukrainian steppes the Prokofievs moved.

By the time of Prokofiev's birth, Maria—having previously lost two daughters—had devoted her life to music; during her son's early childhood, she spent two months a year in Moscow or St Petersburg taking piano lessons. Sergei Prokofiev was inspired by hearing his mother practicing the piano in the evenings, mostly works by Chopin and Beethoven , and wrote his first piano composition at the age of five, an \"Indian Gallop\", which was written down by his mother: it was in the F Lydian mode (a major scale with a raised 4th scale degree), as the young Prokofiev felt \"reluctance to tackle the black notes\". By seven, he had also learned to play chess . Chess remained a passion of his, and he became acquainted with world chess champions José Raúl Capablanca , whom he beat in a simultaneous exhibition match in 1914, and Mikhail Botvinnik , with whom he played several matches in the 1930s. At the age of nine, he composed his first opera, The Giant , as well as an overture and various other pieces. Opera remained thereafter as the genre Prokofiev was most fond of working in.
