He started his criminal career in the Five Points Gang and was instrumental in the development of the National Crime Syndicate . Luciano is considered the father of the Italian-American Mafia for the establishment of the Commission in 1931, after he abolished the boss of bosses title held by Salvatore Maranzano following the Castellammarese War . He was also the first official boss of the modern Genovese crime family . In 1936, Luciano was tried and convicted for compulsory prostitution and running a prostitution racket after years of investigation by District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey .

In 1946, for his alleged wartime cooperation, Luciano's sentence was commuted on the condition that he be deported to",

Lucchese identified Maranzano to the other two gangsters, who proceeded to stab the boss multiple times before shooting him. This assassination was the first of what would later be fabled as the \"Night of the Sicilian Vespers \".
