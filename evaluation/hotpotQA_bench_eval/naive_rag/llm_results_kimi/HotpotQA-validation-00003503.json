      "text": "XVideos (stylized as XVIDEOS ) is a Czech-French Internet pornography video sharing and viewing website. Founded in Paris in 2007, the website is now registered to the Czech company WGCZ Holding. As of October 2025 [update] , it is the 30th- most-visited website in the world and the third-most-visited pornography website after Pornhub and xHamster . WGCZ Holding also owns Bang Bros , Penthouse magazine , Private Media Group , XNXX , DDF Network and Erogames and has a controlling interest in the productions gathered under the Legal Porno brand. History Former XVideos logo XVideos was founded in Paris in 2007 by the French owner Stephane Michael Pacaud. XVideos serves as a pornographic media aggregator, a type of website which gives access to adult content in a similar manner as YouTube does for general content. Video clips from professional videos are mixed with amateur and other types of content. By 2012, XVideos was the largest porn website in the world, with over 100 billion page views per month. Fabian Thylmann , the owner of MindGeek (now Aylo ), attempted to purchase XVideos in 2012 in order to create a monopoly of pornographic tube sites. The French owner of XVideos turned down a reported offer of more than US$120 million by saying, \"Sorry, I have to go and play Diablo II .\" In 2014,",

Web traffic and ranking As of August 2021 [update] , XVideos was the most-visited porn website and the seventh-most-visited website in the world, as ranked by Similarweb . XNXX , another site owned by WGCZ Holding, was the tenth-most-visited website overall and the second-most-visited website in the adult category by 2021, although competitor Pornhub was ranked one slot above XNXX by 2024. Both XVideos and XNXX were also the world's most-visited websites for virtual reality videos in 2021.

Data breaches In February 2012, the site was hacked, with the details of over 1 million users leaked onto the Internet. MindGeek blamed this on the failings of a third-party chat service. Blocking France After France passed a law requiring age verification for pornographic sites in June 2025, Aylo blocked access to YouPorn, as well as RedTube and Pornhub in France. Germany German law does not allow hardcore pornography without an effective age verification system, and the German Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons placed YouPorn on its index. As a result, since April 2007, the German site of the Google search engine classified YouPorn as a hardcore pornography website and replaced it with a link to Chilling Effects , claiming that a \"German regulatory body reported illegal material\". Following a request by Kirchberg, the owner of a competing pornography service (now defunct), German provider Arcor categorized YouPorn and a few other porn sites as hardcore pornographic and also blocked access to the website at the routing level in September 2007, affecting over 2 million users. The German Pirate Party promptly opened a proxy server so that Arcor customers could continue to easily access YouPorn. Arcor lifted the block on September 17 because the IP address -based filter which had been set up for YouPorn adversely",

Kirchberg then sued, alleging that Arcor aided unfair competition by YouPorn, and on October 19, 2007, obtained a temporary injunction ordering Arcor to resume limiting the accessibility to YouPorn.com. On October 23, 2007, Arcor started to control access to YouPorn again, this time with a DNS -based approach that is easily circumvented, and successfully filed an appeal against the injunction. Kirchberg has sent notices to 19 German ISPs demanding that YouPorn be granted access limitations, but none have complied. Efforts by Kirchberg to obtain injunctions regarding YouPorn from internet providers in Kiel and Düsseldorf were unsuccessful. Singapore In May 2008 it was reported that Singapore had blocked access to YouPorn and RedTube , in what a government officials described as \"a symbolic statement\". Sri Lanka In July 2009 Sri Lanka blocked access to 12 porn web sites including YouPorn, RedTube , XVideos and xHamster . On July 25, 2009, Sri Lanka Chief Magistrate Nishantha Hapuarachchi ordered the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission to block those 12 websites from all local Internet Service Providers.

Ownership YouPorn's own site reports that its owner is Midstream Media International N.V., seated in Willemstad , the capital city of Curaçao , an island in the southern Caribbean Sea that forms a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands . The site is run from a hosting service in Texas, although one reporter described the site as \"German-based\". In 2011, YouPorn was purchased by the adult entertainment and IT company Manwin , owners of other popular pornographic websites such as Pornhub and SpankWire based in Luxembourg . Bandwidth As of 2012, [update] ExtremeTech reported YouPorn transferred an average of 950 TB per day, up from a reported figure of 3 TB per day in 2006. Response Concerns have surfaced over the inability to verify the age of the persons depicted in the videos, the possibility of copyrighted videos being uploaded to the site, and the possibility of privacy violations when private sex tapes are uploaded without the consent of all involved parties. In 2007 Vivid Entertainment took legal action against YouPorn, claiming that the streaming of copyrighted material was depriving it of revenue. YouPorn has been called \"a good role model for the sexually naive\", as many of its homemade videos depict amateur couples having ordinary sex (known as \"Amateur\"), as opposed to the often unreal scenarios of commercial porn.
