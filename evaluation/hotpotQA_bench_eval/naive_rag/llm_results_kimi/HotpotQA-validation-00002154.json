Critical reception Jesse Schedeen from IGN rated the episode a 5.8 out of 10, writing that it \"tackled many subjects and failed to combine them into a proper whole.\" Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania rated it a 5.0 out of 10, stating \"[the episode] didn't exactly provide hope for this year. There were some funny moments and I appreciated how Matt and Trey spun the narrative, but it didn't 'wow' me the way I was hoping.\" The A.V. Club contributor Dan Caffrey gave the episode a C+ rating, commenting \"Parker and Stone never take their redneck/white nationalist stereotypes far enough from the source material for it to work as a joke that can stand on its own. And because they borrow so heavily from the Charlottesville protests without ever fully skewering the participants, the episode doesn't work as social commentary, either.\" Writing for Den of Geek , Chris Longo gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars, and stated \"From a show that had more biting satirical commentary on topics like Safe Spaces and PC culture, George Zimmerman, and Black Lives Matter, I expected a much stronger response to the events of Charlottesville from a South Park season premiere.\" References External links \"White People Renovating Houses\" at IMDb \"White People Renovating",

This season had planned \"dark weeks\" (weeks during which no new episodes would air) after episode three, episode six, and episode eight. The season lampooned many events and cultural institutions such as the Trump administration , the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville , Netflix , the Marvel Cinematic Universe , and themes of self-victimization . The season received mixed to positive reviews, with many reviewers praising the show's ability to remain relevant and choice of abandoning the linear narrative that dominated much of the previous season , despite many of the previous story threads being carried over into this season such as Cartman's relationship with Heidi. The seasons ratings declined overall in comparison to the previous season. The second episode \"Put It Down\" received an Emmy nomination. Marketing Comedy Central announced on August 22 that the network would be running a marathon of South Park consisting of 254 episodes, all airing over eight days, in a similar vein to The Simpsons 600 episode marathon that aired over 13 days of the previous year. The marathon drew more than 10 million unique viewers to the network. Online across Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter over 7 million video views were generated as well as 500,000 engagements. The stunt helped increase the ratings of other Comedy Central programs as well such as Broad City , which premiered directly after South Park. Episodes Reception The",
