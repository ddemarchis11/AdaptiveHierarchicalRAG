Amundsen also planned to kill most of his dogs on the way and use them as a source for fresh meat. As he went he butchered some of the dogs and fed them to the remaining dogs, as well as eating some himself. A small group, including Hjalmar Johansen , Kristian Prestrud and Jørgen Stubberud , set out on 8 September, but had to abandon their trek due to extreme temperatures. The painful retreat caused a quarrel within the group, and Amundsen sent Johansen and the other two men to explore King Edward VII Land . A second attempt, with a team of five made up of Olav Bjaaland , Helmer Hanssen , Sverre Hassel , Oscar Wisting and Amundsen, departed base camp on 19 October. They took four sledges and 52 dogs. Using a route along the previously unknown Axel Heiberg Glacier , they arrived at the edge of the Polar Plateau on 21 November after a four-day climb. The team and 16 dogs arrived at the pole on 14 December, a month before Scott's group. Amundsen named their South Pole camp Polheim . Amundsen renamed the Antarctic",

It was discovered in 1911 by Roald Amundsen , who named it for the daughter of Fridtjof Nansen . Richard E. Byrd chose this glacier as his route to the Polar Plateau on 28 November 1929 when he flew from Little America to the South Pole. Location Upper course of the glacier (east of map) Mouth of the glacier (east of the map) According to Sailing Directions for Antarctica (1960), \"The Liv Glacier (85° S. 168° W.) reaches the Ross Ice Shelf on the western side of the Duncan Mountains. It is about 7 miles wide and trends southward about 40 miles to the polar plateau. The Fisher Mountains rise prominently forming the western wall, and the massif of Mount Fridtjof Nansen , about 13,156 feet high, forms the eastern flank of the Liv Glacier. The northern slopes of this sandstone and granite massif were investigated by Gould in 1929, and",

He was the Archbishop of New Zealand from 2004 to 2006, the first person from the Māori church to hold that office. He was also Bishop of Aotearoa from 1981, the first person to be elected to that position by the congregation rather than being appointed by the church hierarchy. He held both offices until his retirement in 2006. He was also the first person to become a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit after the rank was introduced in 2000. Early life Vercoe was born in Tōrere , a coastal Māori village ( kāinga ) near Ōpōtiki in the Eastern Bay of Plenty , in the North Island , to Joseph Vercoe and Wyness Williams. He was named Whakahuihui (\"to gather together\") to record the crowds that gathered to pay their respects to his grandmother, who died on the day he was born. His paternal grandfather, Henry Vercoe, was a Cornish farmer and settler in New Zealand. His father left the family soon after he was born, and he was raised by his mother and maternal grandfather, a Māori farmer, in a small earthen-floored shack ( kauta ). He was educated at",

      "text": "knowledge has been something separate from ethics. In modern times, Foucault argues, anyone can reach \"knowledge\", as long as they are rational beings, educated, willing to participate in the scientific community and use a scientific method. Foucault is critical of this \"modern\" view of knowledge. Foucault describes two types of \"knowledge\": \"savoir\" and \"connaissance\", two French terms that both can be translated as \"knowledge\" but with separate meanings for Foucault. By \"savoir\" Foucault is referring to a process where subjects are created, while at the same time these subjects also become objects for knowledge. An example of this can be seen in criminology and psychiatry. In these sciences, subjects such as \"the rational person\", \"the mentally ill person\", \"the law abiding person\", \"the criminal\", etc. are created, and these sciences center their attention and knowledge on these subjects. The knowledge about these subjects is \"connaissance\", while the process in which subjects and knowledge are created is \"savoir\". A similar term in Foucault's corpus is \"pouvoir/savoir\" (power/knowledge). With this term Foucault is referring to a type of knowledge that is considered \"common sense\", but that is created and withheld in that position (as \"common sense\") by power. The term power/knowledge comes from Jeremy Bentham 's idea that panopticons wouldn't only be",

GameSpot found that playing in first-person heightened the impact of Grand Theft Auto V 's violence, which made him reflect on morality and character motivation more than before. VideoGamer.com opined that players feel like inhabitants of the world, rather than \"guns attached to a floating camera\". The first-person view, in IGN ' s opinion, aided immersion and created a \"surprisingly different experience\". VideoGamer.com praised the \"finer details\" in first-person animations like camera lean when players take corners on motorcycles, or the navigational instruments in plane cockpits. Reviewers found playing the game more difficult in first-person, but Game Informer preferred the challenge. GameSpot thought the improved graphics and spatial anti-aliasing made the open world \"even more spectacular\". They said that in first-person \"everything looks bigger and more imposing\". IGN favoured the PlayStation 4 version's graphics over the Xbox One but thought both consoles rendered the game well and maintained mostly consistent frame rates. They praised the increased frame rate and graphics options offered in the PC version. VideoGamer.com called the console version's frame rate so consistent it was \"scarcely believable\", although GameSpot cited occasional frame rate dips. They opined that the PC version let players \"witness the full extent of Rockstar's admirable handiwork\", but noted that it \"retains evidence of its",

      "text": "A first-person narrative (also known as a first-person perspective , voice , point of view , etc.) is a mode of storytelling in which a storyteller recounts events from that storyteller's own personal point of view , using first-person grammar such as \"I\", \"me\", \"my\", and \"myself\" (also, in plural form, \"we\", \"us\", etc.). It must be narrated by a first-person character, such as a protagonist (or other focal character ), re-teller, witness, or peripheral character. Alternatively, in a visual storytelling medium (such as video, television, or film), the first-person perspective is a graphical perspective rendered through a character's visual field, so the camera is \"seeing\" out of a character's eyes. Charlotte Brontë , the author of Jane Eyre , which is known as \"the classic example of first-person narrative\" A classic example of a first-person protagonist narrator is Charlotte Brontë 's Jane Eyre (1847), in which the title character is telling the story in which she herself is also the protagonist: \"I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me\".
