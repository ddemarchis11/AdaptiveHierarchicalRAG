Band members have since wondered if Kath would have stayed with Chicago had he lived or started a solo career. In 2010, Parazaider said: \"I'm not sure about that. [Terry] was a free spirit ... He was his own person when it came to different things. I would like to think he (would still be with Chicago) but he was very independent and I wonder what he would have thought about the 1980s. I'd have to say it's 50/50. It could have gone either way.\" In 2012, Kath's daughter Michelle Kath Sinclair announced that enough funds had been donated to complete production on a documentary of his life, titled Searching for Terry: Discovering a Guitar Legend . In 2014, she confirmed she had interviewed the entire band except for Cetera and the project was planned for release in 2016.
