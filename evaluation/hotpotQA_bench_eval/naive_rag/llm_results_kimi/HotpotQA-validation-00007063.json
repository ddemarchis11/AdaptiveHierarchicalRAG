      "text": "Rolf Martin Theodor Dahlgren (7 July 1932 – 14 February 1987) was a Swedish - Danish botanist and professor at the University of Copenhagen from 1973 to his death. Life Dahlgren was born in Örebro on 7 July 1932 to apothecary Rudolf Dahlgren and wife Greta née Dahlstrand. He took his MSc degree in Biology in (1955) and PhD degree in Botany in (1963) at Lund University . He was killed in a car crash in Scania , Sweden on 14 February 1987. Career He continued working on South African plants during expeditions in 1956-57 and 1965–66, while affiliated with the Botanical Museum in Lund as docent . In 1973, he became professor of botany at the University of Copenhagen . Here, he developed his system of Angiosperm classification, based on many more characters simultaneously than previous systems, most notably many chemical plant traits (see also chemotaxonomy ). Although the system was first presented in Danish , it rapidly gained widespread acceptance, particularly due to the instructive diagrams, so-called Dahlgrenograms. His work on family circumscription in the Monocotyledons , published with Harold Trevor Clifford and Peter Frederick Yeo, has had profound influence well into the molecular age. A Rolf Dahlgren Memorial Symposium was held in Berlin , Germany later",

      "text": "the Faculty of Mathematics and Science was separated from the Faculty of Philosophy . In 1845 and 1862 Copenhagen co-hosted Nordic student meetings with Lund University . The first female student was enrolled at the university in 1877. The university underwent explosive growth between 1960 and 1980. The number of students rose from around 6,000 in 1960 to about 26,000 in 1980, with a correspondingly large growth in the number of employees. Buildings built during this time period include the new Zoological Museum, the Hans Christian Ørsted and August Krogh Institutes, the campus centre on Amager Island , and the Panum Institute . The Geological Museum, now part of the Natural History Museum of Denmark The new university statute instituted in 1970 involved democratisation of the management of the university. It was modified in 1973 and subsequently applied to all higher education institutions in Denmark. The democratisation was later reversed with the 2003 university reforms. Further change in the structure of the university from 1990 to 1993 made a Bachelor's degree programme mandatory in virtually all subjects. Also in 1993, the law departments broke off from the Faculty of Social Sciences to form a separate Faculty of Law . In 1994, the University of Copenhagen designated environmental studies , north–south relations, and biotechnology as areas of special priority according to its new long-term plan. Starting in 1996 and continuing to the present,",
