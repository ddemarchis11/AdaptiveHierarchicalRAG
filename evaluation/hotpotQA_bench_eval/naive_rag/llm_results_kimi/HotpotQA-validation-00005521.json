  "question": "What is the central institution of Cheyenne Indian tribal governance that Ehyophsta was not a member of?",
  "gold_answer": "the Council of Forty-four",
  "llm_answer": "The central institutions of traditional Cheyenne tribal governance are the Cheyenne military societies and the Council of Forty-four. Ehyophsta was a member of a society of women who had gone to war, but the evidence does not state that she was a member of either the Council of Forty-four or any of the named military societies. Therefore, the central institution she was not a member of is the Council of Forty-four.",

      "text": "A member of the Cheyenne Soldier Society, The Red Shields Cheyenne military societies are one of the two central institutions of traditional Cheyenne native American tribal governance, the other being the Council of Forty-four . While council chiefs are responsible for overall governance of individual bands and the tribe as a whole, the headmen of military societies are in charge of maintaining discipline within the tribe, overseeing tribal hunts and ceremonies, and providing military leadership. Historically, council chiefs selected which of the six military societies would assume these duties; after a period of time on-duty, the chiefs would select a different society to take up the duties. Four original societies The prophet Sweet Medicine ( Motsé'eóeve ) was said to designate the four original Cheyenne warrior societies (pl. Nótȧxévėstotȯtse , sing. Nótȧxévestȯtse ), which had their own society songs ( nótȧxénootȯtse ) and were governed by a head man ( nótȧxévėhoneve ). Over the ages, some have developed branches or have transformed.

Sixth society Contrary Warriors Society ( Hohnóhkao'o ), also known as the Inverted Bow-string Society . Its members, the Contrary Warriors, have proved their bravery by riding backward into battle. Contrary Society (sing. Hohnohka , pl. Hohnóhkao'o ), also known as Clown Society . This society draws upon the same spiritual powers as the Contrary Warriors Society. It is primarily composed of Cheyenne elders and may be a mature variation of the Contrary Warriors Society. They were charged with teaching the Cheyenne ceremonial ways of the cultural \"dos\" and \"don'ts\" through humour, sarcasm and satire, in a fashion contrary to the traditional Cheyenne culture. Warrior Women's Society Ehyophsta , who fought in the Battle of Beecher Island , was a member of a society of \"women who had gone to war with their husbands\". That qualification seems to be wrong since she is known to have become a warrior only when she was widowed. John Sipes Jr, late Southern Cheyenne tribal historian, mentioned that his ancestor Mochi was a warrior in her own right, had her own war pony and war medicine and was also a member of that society.

      "text": "Ehyophsta ( Cheyenne : Yellow-Haired Woman , c. 1826 – 1915) was a Cheyenne woman warrior. She was the daughter of a chief, Stands-in-the-Timber, who died in 1849, and the niece of Bad Faced Bull. She fought in the Battle of Beecher Island in 1868, and also fought the Shoshone that same year, where she counted coup against one enemy and killed another. She fought the Shoshone again in 1869, and during battle she stabbed and killed an enemy, saving a member of her own people. It is said that she rode her father's horse, and sang songs alongside a fellow woman warrior, Buffalo Wallow Woman of the Lakota. She was also a member of a secret society composed exclusively of Cheyenne women. During this period, Cheyenne women often participated in battle, dressed and armed the same as the male warriors were. She died in August of 1915 at the Tongue River Reservation in Montana, aged eighty-nine.
