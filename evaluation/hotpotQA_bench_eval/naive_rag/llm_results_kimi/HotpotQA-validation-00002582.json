Her father, a medical doctor, served as a lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve and was in private practice as an otolaryngologist until 2012. Her mother, Mary Elizabeth \"Betty\" ( née Reese) Witherspoon, holds a PhD in pediatric nursing and was a professor of nursing at Vanderbilt University . Witherspoon has claimed descent from Scottish-born John Witherspoon , who signed the United States Declaration of Independence . This claim has not been verified by genealogists from the Society of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence. Her parents are still legally married, although they separated in 1996. Raised as an Episcopalian , Witherspoon has expressed pride in her \"definitive Southern upbringing,\" which she said gave her \"a sense of family and tradition\" and taught her about \"being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible, and never taking for granted what you have in your life.\" At age seven, she was selected as a model for a florist's television ads, which motivated her to enroll in acting lessons. At age 11, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair. She received high grades in school and considered herself, as she put it, \"a big dork who [loved] read[ing] loads of books.\" Regarding this passion, she said, \"I",

      "text": "The City of New Orleans is a long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak in the Central United States between Chicago and New Orleans . The overnight train takes about 19 1 ⁄ 2 hours to complete its 934-mile (1,503 km) route, making major stops in Champaign–Urbana , Carbondale , Memphis , and Jackson as well as in other small towns. The City of New Orleans was first initiated by the Illinois Central Railroad in 1947 as the daytime complement to the Panama Limited , a night train dating back to 1911. In 1971 both routes were conveyed to Amtrak, which retained only the Panama Limited . In 1981 Amtrak revived the City of New Orleans name for the train, still on an overnight schedule, on the heels of the popular song of the same name by Steve Goodman . Additional corridor service on the northern segment of the route is provided by the Illini and Saluki between Chicago and Carbondale, Illinois. The City of New Orleans is the only Amtrak train to serve Tennessee . During fiscal year 2023, the train carried 233,876 passengers, an increase of 50.3% from FY2022. In FY2016, the last year that route-specific revenue data was given, the train had a total revenue of $ 18,706,915, a 3.7% decrease from FY2015. History Illinois Central IC #4017, an EMD",

      "text": "in 1967. Amtrak City of New Orleans , October 2005 When Amtrak assumed operation of U.S. passenger train service on May 1, 1971, it dropped the Panama Limited in favor of retaining the City of New Orleans on the traditional daytime schedule. At that time the City of New Orleans was one of four trains that called at Chicago's Central Station , which was originally Illinois Central's terminal in Chicago. All Amtrak trains were consolidated to Union Station by March 1972. Inauspiciously, the City of New Orleans was involved in Amtrak's first fatal derailment on June 10, near Salem, Illinois . Because this train made no connections with other trains at either New Orleans or Chicago, Amtrak moved the train to an overnight schedule on November 14, 1971, and renamed it the Panama Limited . In February 1981, Amtrak restored the City of New Orleans name while retaining the overnight schedule; Amtrak hoped to capitalize on the popularity of the song written by Steve Goodman and recorded in 1972 by Arlo Guthrie . A Kansas City section, the River Cities , began operation on April 29, 1984. It separated from the City of New Orleans at Centralia, Illinois (later Carbondale) and ran to Kansas City via St. Louis. This section ended on November 4, 1994. The northbound City of New Orleans began stopping at Gilman, Illinois , on",
