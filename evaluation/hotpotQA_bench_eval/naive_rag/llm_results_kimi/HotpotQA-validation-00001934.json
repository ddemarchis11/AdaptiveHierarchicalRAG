      "text": "Another Country is the third studio album by singer-songwriter Tift Merritt , released on February 26, 2008, by Fantasy Records . It was recorded in Los Angeles in the summer of 2007 with producer George Drakoulias , who had produced Merritt's previous studio album, Tambourine (2004). The songs for the album were written by Merritt on the pianos in the apartments she rented during an extended solo trip to Paris, which she undertook after feeling worn out from continual touring. She has described the writing as a plainspoken look at the distance we all attempt to cross: between two people, between one heart and the rest of the world. Its first week of release, \"Broken\", the album's first single, reached #1 on the Americana Radio Chart compiled by the Americana Music Association . Track listing All songs written by Tift Merritt, unless otherwise noted.
