  "question": "Who developed the jet fighters operated by the 41st Tactical Squadron of the Polish Air Force?",
  "gold_answer": "the Mikoyan design bureau",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence does not directly answer the question of who developed the jet fighters operated by the 41st Tactical Squadron of the Polish Air Force. However, it does mention that the 41st Tactical Squadron operates Mikoyan MiG-29 jet fighters acquired from the German Air Force.\n\nThe development of the MiG-29 is mentioned in the text, but it does not provide information on who developed it. However, it does mention that Poland acquired the MiG-29s from the German Air Force and that the first 12 MiG-29s delivered to Poland were manufactured in 1989-1990.\n\nTherefore, I can only provide a partial answer to the question. The development of the MiG-29 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided evidence, but it is known that the MiG-29 was manufactured by Mikoyan, a Russian aerospace company.",
