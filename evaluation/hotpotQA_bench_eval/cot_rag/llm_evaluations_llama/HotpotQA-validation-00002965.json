  "question": "Which has more species, Sonerila or Scaevola?",
  "gold_answer": "Sonerila",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, Scaevola has more species than Sonerila.\n\nScaevola has more than 130 species, as stated in the evidence [HotpotQA-validation-00002965/01_Scaevola-plant.html_c_0].\n\nSonerila has about 175 species, as stated in the evidence [HotpotQA-validation-00002965/00_Sonerila.html_c_0].\n\nHowever, a new species of Sonerila was described in 2025, which is Sonerila bababudangiriensis Karad. & Kakkal. This means that the total number of Sonerila species is now 176.\n\nSince Scaevola has more than 130 species and Sonerila has 176 species, Scaevola still has fewer species than Sonerila.",
