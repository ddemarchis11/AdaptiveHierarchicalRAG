    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies Esom, a South Korean actress, as the star of 'Innocence,' which is irrelevant to the question. The correct answer, Stephanie Caroline March, is clearly supported by the context, which mentions her role as Alexandra Cabot in the NBC series 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.' The Model Answer fails to address the question and does not align with the retrieved context or the Gold Answer."
