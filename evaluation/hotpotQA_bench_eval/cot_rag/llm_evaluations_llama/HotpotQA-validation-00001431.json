  "llm_answer": "The English nursery rhyme that appears on Teletubbies and says \"Eh-oh!\" is not explicitly mentioned in the provided evidence. However, the evidence does mention that the Teletubbies sing \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\" and the flowers from Teletubbyland sing \"Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary\".",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies 'Baa, Baa, Black Sheep' as one of the nursery rhymes sung by the Teletubbies, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces 'Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary' as sung by the flowers, which is irrelevant to the specific question. While the core answer is present, the model's phrasing creates ambiguity and does not clearly confirm 'Baa, Baa, Black Sheep' as the sole answer to the question."
