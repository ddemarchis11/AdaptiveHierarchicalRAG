  "question": "Are McFarland, USA and The Black Hole both sports films?",
  "gold_answer": "no",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, McFarland, USA is a sports film. \n\nThe evidence states that McFarland, USA is a 2015 American sports drama film directed by Niki Caro, based on the true story of a 1987 cross country team from a mainly Latino high school in McFarland, California.\n\nHowever, The Black Hole is not a sports film. The evidence lists various meanings of the term \"Black Hole\", including a 1979 science fiction film, a 1995 film, a 2006 film, a 2015 documentary film, a 2016 science fiction thriller, and a 2016 episode of the TV series House, but none of these are sports films.",
