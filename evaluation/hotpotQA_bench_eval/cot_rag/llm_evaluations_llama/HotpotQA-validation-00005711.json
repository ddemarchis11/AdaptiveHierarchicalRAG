  "question": "Robin R. Bottin is known for his collaboration with an American director and producer who won an Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA award for what movie?",
  "gold_answer": "The Social Network",
  "llm_answer": "There is insufficient evidence to determine which American director and producer Robin R. Bottin collaborated with to win an Academy Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA award.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that there is insufficient evidence to determine the answer, which is incorrect. The Gold Answer specifies 'The Social Network,' and the context confirms that David Fincher, a collaborator of Robin R. Bottin, won an Academy Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA for 'The Social Network.' The Model Answer is faithful to the context in acknowledging the lack of explicit evidence but fails to provide the correct answer or cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
