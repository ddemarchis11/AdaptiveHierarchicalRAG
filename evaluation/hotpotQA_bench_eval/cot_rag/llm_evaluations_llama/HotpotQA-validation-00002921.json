  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the company as an insurance and finance corporation, which aligns with the retrieved context. However, it does not specify that AIA is a pan-Asian life insurance group, as stated in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it misses the specific detail about the company's regional focus and primary business area, which impacts evidence coverage and correctness."
