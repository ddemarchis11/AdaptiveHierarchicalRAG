    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct population of Didsbury, Manchester, England, as stated in the Gold Answer (26,788). Instead, it discusses irrelevant information about Metro Vihar, which is unrelated to the question or the context. The retrieved context does not contain the population data for Didsbury, but the Model Answer does not use internal knowledge to provide the correct answer either."
