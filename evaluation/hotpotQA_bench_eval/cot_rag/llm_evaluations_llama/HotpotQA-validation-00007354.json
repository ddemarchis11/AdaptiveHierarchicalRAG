    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct county seat for Henderson Point, Mississippi, which is Gulfport and Biloxi as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context supports this information, as Henderson Point is part of the Gulfport-Biloxi Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Model Answer incorrectly claims the information is not explicitly stated, which is inaccurate."
