  "question": "What was the Canadian movie called in Italy that stared a professional American football defensive end of the National Football League along with Michael Ironside?",
  "gold_answer": "Anno 2053",
  "llm_answer": "Insufficient evidence to answer the question.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is correct based on the retrieved context, as the context does not provide any information about the Canadian movie 'Anno 2053' or its cast. However, the Model Answer fails to provide the correct answer ('Anno 2053') despite the Gold Answer being available, leading to a score of 0.0 for correctness and evidence coverage."
