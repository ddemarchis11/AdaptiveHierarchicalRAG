    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Waco Regional Airport as city-owned based on the context. However, it does not provide direct evidence from the retrieved context to confirm that Idaho Falls Regional Airport is city-owned, relying instead on indirect reasoning. This results in partial correctness and incomplete evidence coverage. Faithfulness is also partial due to the lack of explicit grounding for Idaho Falls Regional Airport's ownership."
