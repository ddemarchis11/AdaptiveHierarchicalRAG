    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that KSCW-DT is part of a duopoly with virtual channel 12 in Wichita but does not explicitly name KWCH-DT, which is the specific station mentioned in the Gold Answer. The context supports the relationship between KSCW-DT and KWCH-DT, making the answer faithful to the retrieved information. However, the omission of the specific station name reduces evidence coverage and correctness."
