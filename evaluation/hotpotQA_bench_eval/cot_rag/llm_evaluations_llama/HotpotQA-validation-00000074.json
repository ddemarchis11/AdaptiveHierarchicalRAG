    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct response to the question, which is William Jefferson Clinton. The retrieved context clearly supports this answer, as it mentions Suettinger's role during the Clinton administration. The Model Answer does not utilize the context effectively and does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
