    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct response, 'Russian Ark,' which is explicitly mentioned in the retrieved context as a historical drama filmed in the Winter Palace. Additionally, the model incorrectly states that it cannot verify the information, despite the context clearly supporting the answer. This results in a complete lack of correctness, faithfulness, and evidence coverage."
