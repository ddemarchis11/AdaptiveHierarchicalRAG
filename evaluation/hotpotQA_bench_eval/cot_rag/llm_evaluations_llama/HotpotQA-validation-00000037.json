    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the Livesey Hall War Memorial commemorates the fallen of both World War I and World War II, which is supported by the context. However, the User's Question specifically asks about the war with over 60 million casualties, which refers to World War II. The Model Answer does not directly address this specific aspect, leading to partial correctness and evidence coverage."
