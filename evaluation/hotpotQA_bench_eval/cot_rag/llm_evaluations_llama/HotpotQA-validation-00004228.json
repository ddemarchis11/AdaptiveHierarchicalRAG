    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the islands as the Antarctican Lindsey Islands, which are named after Alton A. Lindsey, the professor of forest ecology at Purdue University from 1947 to 1973. However, it does not specify their location at the northwest tip of Canisteo Peninsula in Amundsen Sea, as stated in the Gold Answer. The retrieved context supports the naming of the islands but does not provide their geographical location, so the Model Answer is faithful to the context but incomplete in terms of evidence coverage."
