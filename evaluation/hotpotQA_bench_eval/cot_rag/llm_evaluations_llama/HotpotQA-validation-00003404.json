    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not directly address the question of who wrote shorter stories between Raymond Carver and Lydia Davis. It provides general information about both authors' works but fails to establish that Lydia Davis wrote shorter stories, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide evidence to support the claims made in the Model Answer, making it unfaithful to the context. The Model Answer also misses the specific fact that Lydia Davis wrote shorter stories, which is the core of the Gold Answer."
