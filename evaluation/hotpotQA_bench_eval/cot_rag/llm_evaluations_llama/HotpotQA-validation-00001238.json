    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct birth year of Walter Dornberger, which is 1895, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the Retrieved Context contains sufficient information to identify Dornberger as the collaborator in Operation Lighthouse, but the Model Answer does not utilize this context effectively or provide any relevant information."
