    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides details about the diet advocated in 'Eat to Live,' such as vegetarian, vegan, low-salt, low-fat, and gluten-free aspects, which are supported by the context. However, it does not explicitly emphasize the 'micronutrient-rich' aspect, which is the core of the Gold Answer. While the additional details are accurate and grounded in the context, they miss the central focus on micronutrient richness, leading to partial correctness and evidence coverage."
