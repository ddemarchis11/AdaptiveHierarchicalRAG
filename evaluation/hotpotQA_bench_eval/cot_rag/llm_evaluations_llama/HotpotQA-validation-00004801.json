    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is correct based on the retrieved context, as there is no mention of J. Cole or any North Carolina native in relation to Danja's production work. However, the Model Answer does not provide the correct answer ('J. Cole') from internal knowledge, leading to a score of 0.0 for correctness and evidence coverage. Faithfulness is rated 1.0 because the response accurately reflects the lack of relevant information in the context."
