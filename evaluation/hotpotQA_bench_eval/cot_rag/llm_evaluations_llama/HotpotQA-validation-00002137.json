    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the user's question about other areas that share a common deer species with the Forests of Mara and Mondrem. While it correctly states the types of deer present in the forests, it does not provide the specific locations mentioned in the Gold Answer (New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the Falkland Islands, and Peru). The retrieved context does not provide information about these areas, so the model's response is faithful to the context but does not answer the question or cover the required evidence."
