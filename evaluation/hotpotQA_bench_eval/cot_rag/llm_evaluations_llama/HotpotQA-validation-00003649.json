  "question": "Are both Papa John's Pizza and Papa Gino's specialized in Pizza?",
  "gold_answer": "yes",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, both Papa John's Pizza and Papa Gino's are specialized in pizza, but to varying degrees.\n\nPapa John's Pizza is primarily a pizza restaurant chain, with a global presence of over 5,500 locations in 49 countries and territories, and it is the world's third-largest pizza delivery company. The company's slogan is \"Better Ingredients. Better Pizza. Papa John's,\" and it has a strong focus on pizza.\n\nPapa Gino's, on the other hand, is a restaurant chain that specializes in traditional thin crust pizza, but it also offers a variety of other menu items, including pasta, subs, salads, and appetizers. While pizza is a significant part of Papa Gino's menu, it is not the only thing they offer.\n\nTherefore, while both chains are specialized in pizza, Papa John's Pizza is more focused on pizza than Papa Gino's.",
