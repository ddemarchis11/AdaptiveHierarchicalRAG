  "question": "How many Academy Awards did the film, in which Jimmy Bryant provided the singing voice for the character Tony, win ?",
  "gold_answer": "10",
  "llm_answer": "Insufficient evidence to answer the question.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect. The Gold Answer clearly states that the film won 10 Academy Awards, and this information is supported by the context mentioning the 1961 film 'West Side Story,' which is widely known to have won 10 Academy Awards. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct response and does not utilize the retrieved context effectively."
