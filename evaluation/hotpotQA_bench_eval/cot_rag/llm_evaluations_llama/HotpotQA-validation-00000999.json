    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states 'played,' which is the shared musical action between Ndebele music and the Musical bow. The Model Answer incorrectly focuses on the use of a resonator, which is not mentioned in the Gold Answer or directly supported by the retrieved context as a shared action. Additionally, the context does not explicitly link Ndebele music to resonators, making the Model Answer unfaithful and missing the core factual point."
