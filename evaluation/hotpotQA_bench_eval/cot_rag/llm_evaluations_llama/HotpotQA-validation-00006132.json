    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the plant families and provides detailed information about Chamelaucium and Vanilla, but it does not directly address the question of their derivation from flowers, which is the core meaning of the Gold Answer. While the context supports the detailed descriptions, the omission of the direct link to 'flowers' reduces evidence coverage and correctness."
