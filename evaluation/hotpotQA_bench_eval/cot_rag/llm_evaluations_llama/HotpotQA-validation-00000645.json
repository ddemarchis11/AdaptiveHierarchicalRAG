    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect. The Retrieved Context explicitly mentions Rosie O'Donnell's involvement in 'Sleepless in Seattle,' confirming her as the comedian born on March 21, 1962, who appeared in the film. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct response and does not utilize the available context."
