    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that Benjamin Britten and Béla Bartók are not from the same country, aligning with the Gold Answer. It provides evidence that Bartók was Hungarian, which is supported by the context. However, the retrieved context does not mention Britten's nationality, and the Model Answer does not address Britten's origin explicitly, which limits evidence coverage and faithfulness to the context."
