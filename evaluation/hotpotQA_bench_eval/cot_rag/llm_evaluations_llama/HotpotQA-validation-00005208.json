    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the Van cat's eyes exhibit a feline form of complete heterochromia, which aligns with the Gold Answer's 'odd-eyed' description. However, it does not explicitly mention the term 'odd-eyed,' which is a key fact from the Gold Answer. The answer is faithful to the context, as the retrieved information supports the description of heterochromia in cats."
