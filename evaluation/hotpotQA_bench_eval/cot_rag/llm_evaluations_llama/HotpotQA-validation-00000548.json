  "question": "In the 2012-13 FC Sion they brought in Gennaro Gattuso and a player who now plays for what Scottish team?",
  "gold_answer": "Scottish Premiership club Hearts",

  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Kyle Lafferty as the player in question, which is supported by the context. However, it does not specify the Scottish team he currently plays for, which is Hearts according to the Gold Answer. While the context mentions Lafferty's career history, including his time at Hearts, the Model Answer fails to include this critical detail, reducing evidence coverage and correctness."
