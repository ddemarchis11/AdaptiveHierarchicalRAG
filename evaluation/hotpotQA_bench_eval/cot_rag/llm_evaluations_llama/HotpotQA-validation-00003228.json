    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that there is insufficient evidence to answer the question, which is incorrect as the Gold Answer provides the scientific name 'I. helicon'. The retrieved context does not directly support the Gold Answer, but the Model Answer fails to utilize internal knowledge to provide the correct response. Thus, the answer is not correct, but it is faithful to the context as it does not contradict or hallucinate information."
