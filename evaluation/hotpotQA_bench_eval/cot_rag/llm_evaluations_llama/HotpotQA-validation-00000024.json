    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies Antoni 'Tolek' Schmeichel as the person voted by the IFFHS in 1992, which is factually wrong. The correct answer is Peter Schmeichel being voted 'World's Best Goalkeeper' in 1992, as supported by the retrieved context. The Model Answer fails to address the question correctly and is not grounded in the provided context."
