    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Watertown, New York, as the location of the Woolworth Building, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces unnecessary and partially incorrect details about other cities like Lancaster and Utica, which are not relevant to the question. While the context supports Watertown as the correct answer, the additional claims about other cities are not fully grounded in the retrieved context, leading to partial faithfulness and evidence coverage."
