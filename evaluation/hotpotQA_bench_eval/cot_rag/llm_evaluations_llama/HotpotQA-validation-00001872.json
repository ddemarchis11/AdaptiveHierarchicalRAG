    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect. The Gold Answer (42.195 kilometers) is supported by the context, as it mentions Sabrina Mockenhaupt's specialization in marathons, which are standardized at 42.195 kilometers. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and does not utilize the context effectively."
