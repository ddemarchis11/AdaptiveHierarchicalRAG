  "question": "Which band did this American businessman, music publisher, writers' representative, filmmaker and record label executive manage while simultaneously managing this group of the album \"More Hot Rocks?\"",
  "gold_answer": "the Beatles",
  "llm_answer": "Insufficient evidence to answer the question.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect because the retrieved context explicitly mentions that Allen Klein managed both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones simultaneously. The Gold Answer is 'the Beatles,' which is supported by the context. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context in acknowledging the lack of explicit evidence for the question, it fails to provide the correct answer based on the available information."
