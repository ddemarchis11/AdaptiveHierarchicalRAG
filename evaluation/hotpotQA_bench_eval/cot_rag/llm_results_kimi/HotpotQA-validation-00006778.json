      "text": "The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game is a board game combining luck and tactics . It was designed by Simon Knock in 1987. Contents The game set consists of an oversized game board, bookmaker 's board, betting slips, deck of specials cards, stack of money, dice , and six large plastic horses-and-jockeys and other items.

Players can bet on another player's horse, and are issued cards which allow them to commit dirty tricks, for instance making a horse fall or forcing the winner to take a drug test . Reception Brian Walker reviewed The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game for Games International magazine, and gave it 3 stars out of 5, and stated that \"Undemanding families will no doubt enjoy it as it is, and for collectors, well, this will definitely go on top of the heap.\" References v t e",

Originally released for arcades using the Sega Model 2 board, ports were published for the Sega Saturn in 1995 and Microsoft Windows in 1997. It is a rally racing game that simulates driving on different surfaces with varying friction, with the car's handling changing accordingly. As the first racing game to incorporate this feature, Sega Rally Championship is considered to be a milestone in the evolution of the racing game genre. The game features both cooperative and competitive multiplayer. An enhanced version was released for the Saturn in 1998, supporting analog controls with the Saturn 3D Pad and online play via the Sega Net Link . Sega Rally Championship received critical acclaim, with praise for its gameplay and controls, and it is considered one of the greatest video games of all time . The Saturn version was lauded for its accuracy to the arcade version; later ports were less well-received. The game spawned the Sega Rally series, and was followed by several ports and sequels on subsequent platforms. Gameplay Gameplay of the desert stage in the Saturn version.

      "text": "Reception Reception The Dreamcast version received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic . Reviewers of IGN and Eurogamer praised the presentation of the PlayStation ( IGN ) and Dreamcast versions ( Eurogamer ), and how the developers were able to recreate popular attractions in-game, and the \"Disney-esque\" charm it has. Both also berated the difficulty (with the CPU racers being so hard to beat), some of the graphics, and the fact that the developers only used a small sound sample from each attraction and looped it, which got annoying quickly. A reviewer of GameSpot called the Dreamcast version a good entry to the kart racing genre, while also bringing attention to its many similarities to Mario Kart . The amount of detail put into the tracks and the sound were also praised, but the reviewer was disappointed by the game's short play length. Greg Orlando of NextGen said of the same console version: \"Video game behemoth Eidos has fallen prey to the notion that wacky characters plus karts plus odd power-ups automatically equals good racing fun. It doesn't\". Nintendo Power gave the Game Boy Color version a mixed review, nearly three months before its U.S. release date.

Completion of an occupation path enables a player to pick up an 'experience' card, which they can use instead of rolling the dice. These enable the player to move one, two or three squares. If a player completes a single occupation path several times, they can pick up multiple experience cards. Other 'opportunity' cards are collected when landing on particular squares on the outer track which gives a player the option to move to an occupation path. Some of these cards are special or golden opportunities and enable the player to begin the occupation path without the usual prerequisites (usually a payment, a particular degree or having completed another occupation path). An unusual feature of this game compared to more modern board games is that individual players need to record much information on their own scoresheet, such as annual salary, degrees earned and number of times occupation paths have been completed. Towards the end of the game, players can trade cards for money or other favors (such as not knocking to the park bench). Reception Games magazine included Careers in their \"Top 100 Games of 1980\", praising it as a \"classic family game\" that is \"Good for two to six players\".
