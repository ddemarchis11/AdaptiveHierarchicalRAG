      "text": "Juan Carlos Onetti Borges (July 1, 1909 – May 30, 1994) was a Uruguayan novelist and author of short stories . Early life Onetti was born in Montevideo , Uruguay. He was the son of Carlos Onetti, a customs official, and Honoria Borges, who belonged to a Brazilian aristocratic family from the state of Rio Grande do Sul . He had two siblings: an older brother Raul, and a younger sister Rachel. The original surname of his family was O'Nety (of Irish or Scottish origin). The writer himself commented: \"the first to come here, my great-great-grandfather, was English , born in Gibraltar . My grandfather was the one who italianized the name\". Career A high school drop-out, Onetti's first novel, El pozo , published in 1939, met with his close friends' immediate acclaim, as well as from some writers and journalists of his time. 500 copies of the book were printed, most of them left to rot at the only bookstore that sold it, Barreiro (the book was not reprinted until the 1960s, with an introduction and preliminary study by Ángel Rama ). Aged 30, Onetti was already working as editing secretary of the famous weekly Uruguayan newspaper Marcha . He had lived for some years in Buenos Aires , where he published short stories and wrote cinema critiques for the local",

      "text": "April Fool's Day is a 1993 book by Australian author Bryce Courtenay . The book is a biography of and tribute to the author's son, Damon Courtenay, a haemophiliac who contracted HIV/AIDS through an infected blood transfusion . The title refers to the date of Damon's death, 1 April 1991 ( April Fools' Day ). Damon was a classic haemophiliac all his life. He attempted to write this book himself but did not have much success. On his death bed, he asked his father to write it for him. Damon talked a lot about love; he believed it was important that everybody knew how to love. Evidence of this is his attitude towards people who treated people with AIDS unfairly.  Not much was known about AIDS back then and those affected were stigmatized. Sources Official website v t e",
