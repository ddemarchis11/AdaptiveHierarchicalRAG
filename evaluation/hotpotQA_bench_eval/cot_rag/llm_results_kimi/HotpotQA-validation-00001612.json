      "text": "signal is multiplexed : Broadcast on behalf of another station Analog-to-digital conversion KWCH shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 12, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 19 to VHF channel 12. After the transition, KWCH became one of four television stations that operated their digital signals on the VHF band that were granted a power increase later that month due to reception issues that the stations experienced as a result of moving their digital channel allocations from UHF to VHF. As reception problems continued even after the increase, the FCC granted KWCH-DT permission to swap transmitter facilities with sister station KSCW-DT; on September 29, 2009, KWCH-DT moved its digital signal back to UHF channel 19, with KSCW-DT moving its digital allocation to VHF channel 12. In 2012, Schurz built a digital replacement translator of KSCW-DT in Wichita, broadcast from the studios. The 12.1 and 12.2 subchannels are also carried; this aids reception of KSCW and KWCH in parts of Wichita that may not get as strong a signal from the Hutchinson",

It is owned by Gray Media alongside Hutchinson -licensed CBS affiliate KWCH-DT (channel 12). The two stations share studios on 37th Street in northeast Wichita; KSCW-DT's transmitter is located in rural northeastern Reno County (east of Hutchinson). KSCW-DT also operates a digital replacement translator on UHF channel 33 (its previous analog signal allotment) from a transmitter in North Wichita, just north of the station's studio facility. History KWCV's second logo used from 2003 to 2006. The station was first licensed on June 8, 1988, under permits from LIN TV filing an application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), under the call letters KWCV. It was temporarily licensed as DKWCV on November 5, 1998, but on February 11, 1999, it was changed back to KWCV. The station first signed on the air on August 5, 1999, along with LIN TV (which also briefly owned KAKE and its satellites in 2000 before selling KAKE to Benedek Broadcasting ) forming and owning 50% of Banks Broadcasting, which would become the station's owner. Originally operating as a WB affiliate, it was branded on-air as \"Kansas' WB\". Prior to the station's launch, The WB's",

      "text": "KWCH-DT (channel 12) is a television station licensed to Hutchinson, Kansas , United States, serving the Wichita area as an affiliate of CBS . It is owned by Gray Media alongside CW affiliate KSCW-DT (channel 33) and maintains studios on 37th Street North in northeast Wichita and a transmitter facility located east of Hutchinson in rural northeastern Reno County . KWCH-DT serves as the flagship of the Kansas Broadcasting System ( KBS ), a network of four full-power stations that relay CBS network and other programming provided by KWCH across central and western Kansas , as well as bordering counties in Colorado , Nebraska , and Oklahoma . The station was established as KTVH in Hutchinson on July 1, 1953, and was the first television station built within the state. Though based in Hutchinson until 1978, when the main studio was officially moved to Wichita, it has had a presence in that city since 1954. The KBS network took its present form in the early 1960s. KTVH was the third-rated news outlet in the area until the owners of two of the other three KBS stations purchased it, changed the call letters to KWCH in 1983, and successfully led it to first place in the local ratings. History KTVH On June 30, 1952, Wichita-Hutchinson Company, Inc., filed an application for a construction permit to build channel 12 in Hutchinson, which the Federal",

      "text": "launched. KSCW became the CW outlet for the market when that network launched on September 18; the station also changed its branding to \"Kansas CW\" on that date. In March 2007, Banks Broadcasting announced that it would sell the station to Schurz Communications , owner of CBS affiliate KWCH (channel 12). The sale closed on July 20, 2007, after which the FCC granted Schurz a \"failing station\" waiver to acquire KSCW. This was necessary because the Wichita designated market area has only seven \"unique\" full-power television stations. The full-power stations operating outside the immediate metropolitan area all operate as satellites of each of Wichita's four major network affiliates (KWCH, KSNW (channel 3), KAKE (channel 10) and KSAS-TV (channel 24)), and the FCC considers the parent and all of its satellites together as one station. That number of unique full-power stations is normally not enough to legally support a duopoly , because Banks Broadcasting tried and failed to find a buyer for KSCW that did not need the \"failing station\" waiver.

Schurz began the process of transitioning the websites of its media properties to the Tribune Interactive platform in Summer 2010 with KWCH and KSCW being the first two using the relaunched Tribune-run platform in late-June (as of 2013, the Schurz television station websites are now operated by Internet Broadcasting ). In 2009, KSCW traded transmitter facilities, moving to KWCH's tower just east of Hutchinson in Reno County . Schurz announced on September 14, 2015, that it would exit broadcasting and sell its television and radio stations, including KSCW-DT, KWCH-DT, and the JSA with KDCU-DT, to Gray Television for $442.5 million. Gray already owns KAKE in Wichita; however, it will sell that station and keep KSCW and KWCH. The FCC approved the Schurz sale on February 12, 2016, and the sale was finalized on February 16. Programming In 2024, KSCW parent company Gray Television reached an agreement to broadcast eight Oklahoma City Thunder games on the station.
