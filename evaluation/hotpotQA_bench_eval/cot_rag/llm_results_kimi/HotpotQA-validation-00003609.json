The evidence describes Incubus as a nu-metal/alternative rock band with no connection to classical music. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to determine if Even/Incubus is known for classical music skill.",

Incubus produced many of their early recordings with Jim Wirt and Chillum Records in the Santa Monica studio 4th Street Recording, only able to work on their music during hours in which they were not in school. In 1994, they recorded their first two-song EP, Let Me Tell Ya 'Bout Root Beer . This was later followed by the debut album Fungus Amongus , also recorded with Wirt and released on Incubus's own label Stopuglynailfungus Music . Incubus then added Gavin Koppel (known by his stage name DJ Lyfe) to the band. In the following year, Incubus signed a seven-record deal with Sony 's Immortal Records , later to become Epic Records . The group was spotted by Epic/Immortal A&R Paul Pontius, who was also responsible for signing Korn to the label. The 1997 six-track EP Enjoy Incubus was the band's first major-label release and was created so the band could present a recording while touring with Korn in Europe. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. (1997–1998) S.C.I.E.N.C.E. , Incubus's second studio album, was released on September 9, 1997. After their album release,",

On February 1, 2007, five finalists were announced for the \"I Dig Incubus\" contest. In a video interview on Blender , bassist and vocalist Ben Kenney said, \"It's almost something that will happen whether or not we want to do it. People will make their own videos for songs. It's kind of a cool way for us to get together with fans out there who are artistic.\" On August 4, 2007, Incubus played on the first day at Baltimore 's Virgin Festival along with bands such as the Police and Beastie Boys . Michael Einziger had been suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome and although he had an operation that has corrected the problem, he needed to recuperate for a few months, hence recent tour plans were postponed. Incubus apologized to fans and continued the tour in the summer and autumn. In February and March 2008, Incubus hit the road again starting in New Zealand and headlining the Soundwave festival in Australia alongside the Offspring and Alexisonfire , and toured Asia performing to sell-out crowds. In Singapore, they met fans at a Meet and Greet session at Changi Airport and performed at Fort Canning Hill. In April, Incubus",

NME described Incubus as a \"fusion-generated funk/nu-metal band\". Maui Time Weekly wrote, \"Incubus was one of the few nu metal bands to survive the purge of the millennium, and they did it through consistent hard work–the band is constantly either in the studio or on tour–and musical development. There are still elements of nu metal in the music the band makes today as they still have a DJ. But in retrospect, Incubus treated that genre like the fad it was, more an indication of that specific time in music, not as the character of the musicians.\" When asked about his thoughts on the scene in a 2013 interview, Brandon Boyd reflected \"Something I know that separated us from nu-metal was a lot of those bands had misogynist lyrics, and we never wrote stuff like that. I never wrote lyrics like that. I guess there were similarities in some of my musical and vocal stylings, but then we came off tour for S.C.I.E.N.C.E. around early '99, and wrote Make Yourself , which was a vastly different album but we were still the same band. We don't try and create any kind of album really. I don't attempt to write any kind of music, this is just what comes out.\" He also told Kerrang :",
