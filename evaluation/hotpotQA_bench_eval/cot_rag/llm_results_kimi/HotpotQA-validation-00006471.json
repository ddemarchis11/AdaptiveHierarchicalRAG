      "text": "\" Grow Some Funk of Your Own \" is a song by British musician Elton John . It was released as a single in 1976 from the album Rock of the Westies . It shared its A-side status with \" I Feel Like a Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford) \". The song went to No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 , but in Britain broke a five-year run of successful singles by failing to reach the top 50 despite extensive radio play. Guitarist Davey Johnstone is credited as a co-writer. Synopsis The song centers on a man who wakes up after a bad dream entailing an episode set in Mexico, where the protagonist (presumably either John or Taupin) falls for a young lady in a small town but is dismissed by her boyfriend, telling him to return to where he came from (hence the lyric, \"Take my advice/take the next flight/and grow your funk/grow your funk at home\"). Reception Cash Box called it \"a hard-driving rocker which has a part audiences will sing along to and maybe provide another encore to his live show\" with \"an absolutely frantic ending with the vibraphones receiving the beating of their lives.\" Record World said that \"Elton shows why he's on top with his 'English charm' and an enthusiastic no holds barred rock 'n' roll sound.\" Personnel Ray Cooper – castanets , tambourine, bell tree , vibraphone Kiki Dee –",
