      "text": "Bruno Richard Hauptmann (November 26, 1899 – April 3, 1936) was a German-American carpenter and criminal who was convicted of the abduction and murder of Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., the 20-month-old son of aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh . The Lindbergh kidnapping became known as the \" crime of the century \". He was executed in 1936 by electric chair at the Trenton State Prison . Both Hauptmann and his wife, Anna Hauptmann, proclaimed his innocence. In recent years, Hauptmann's guilt has been questioned by authors and researchers, and law enforcement behavior in the case has been widely criticized. Background Bruno Richard Hauptmann was born on November 26, 1899, in Kamenz , a town near Dresden in the Kingdom of Saxony , which was a state of the German Empire . He was the youngest of five children. Neither Hauptmann nor his family or friends used the name Bruno, although prosecutors in the Lindbergh kidnapping trial insisted on referring to him by that name. At age 11, Hauptmann joined the Boy Scouts ( Pfadfinderbund ). He attended public school during the day while attending trade school ( Gewerbeschule ) at night, studying carpentry for the first year, then switching to machine building ( Maschinenschlosser ) for the next two years. Hauptmann's father died in 1917. That same",

Released after three years in prison, Hauptmann was arrested three months later on suspicion of additional burglaries. Hauptmann illegally entered the United States by stowing away on an ocean liner. Landing in New York City in November 1923, the 24-year-old Hauptmann was protected by a member of the established German community and worked as a carpenter . He married a German waitress, Anna Schoeffler (1898–1994), in 1925 and became a father eight years later. Hauptmann was known to be very secretive; Anna did not know his first name was Bruno until his arrest. Lindbergh kidnapping Crime and investigation On the evening of March 1, 1932, Charles Lindbergh Jr., 20-month-old son of aviator Charles Lindbergh , was kidnapped from Highfields , New Jersey; a homemade ladder was found under the window of the child's room. A ransom note demanded $50,000 (equivalent to $1.15 million in 2024). John F. Condon delivered the requested money, but the infant's body was found on May 12 in woods 4 miles (6.4 km) from the family's home. The death was ascribed to a blow to the head, which some have theorized occurred accidentally during the abduction. The ransom bills became increasingly used, and NYPD officer James J.",

This was the first American prosecution for a crime which took place in two different jurisdictions, as Botkin had sent the poison from California, but it was received in Delaware. Background Botkin was born in Polk County, Missouri in 1854. She later moved with her family to California , where she married her husband, Welcome Botkin. They were the parents of one son. In 1895, Botkin met John Preston Dunning while he was bicycling in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park . At the time she was 41 years old, nine years his senior. Both of them were married, but Dunning was smitten with her. Dunning was a highly regarded reporter for the Associated Press , having completed overseas assignments in Samoa and Chile. He had been promoted to superintendent of the Associated Press's Western Division bureau in San Francisco. In 1896, Dunning's wife, Mary Elizabeth (Penington) Dunning, upset by her husband's marital indiscretions, left him and returned with their daughter to Dover, Delaware , to the home of her father, former Congressman John B. Penington . By then Botkin had become Dunning's lover and constant companion. Botkin was estranged from her own husband, a grain broker in Stockton, California , but he supported her",

The term has sometimes been used to refer to electric chairs in general, and not the one used in any specific state. New Jersey New Jersey's Old Smokey is on display at the New Jersey State Police Museum . The chair's most notorious target was Richard Hauptmann , the man behind the Lindbergh kidnapping . The chair at the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton was used in the electrocution of 159 men for capital punishment in New Jersey , starting with Saverio DiGiovanni on December 11, 1907, and ending with Ralph Hudson on January 22, 1963, which also was the final execution carried out in New Jersey. Hauptmann was executed on April 3, 1936. After the death penalty was abolished nationwide in 1972 following Furman v. Georgia , the chair was moved to storage and the chamber was converted to a visitor center. In the 1980s, the chair was put on exhibit at the now-defunct Capital Punishment Museum, housed in a building at the New Jersey State Corrections Academy; after its curator died in 1995, the chair was sent to the New Jersey State Museum and later was transferred to the New Jersey State Police Museum in Ewing Township , where it remains on display.

He was acquitted at trial, thanking Costello in the courtroom after the verdict. Costello was allowed to retire after conceding control of what is today called the Genovese crime family to Genovese. Luciano was powerless to stop these events. On October 25, 1957, Genovese and Gambino successfully arranged the murder of Anastasia, another Luciano ally. The following month, Genovese called a meeting of bosses in Apalachin, New York , to approve his takeover of the Genovese family and to establish his national power. Instead, the Apalachin Meeting turned into a fiasco when law enforcement became aware of the meeting and conducted a raid. Over 65 high-ranking mobsters were arrested, and the Mafia was subjected to publicity and numerous grand jury summonses . The enraged mobsters blamed Genovese for the disaster, opening a window of opportunity for Genovese's opponents. Luciano allegedly attended a meeting at a hotel in Palermo to discuss heroin trade as part of the French Connection . After this meeting, Luciano allegedly helped pay part of $100,000 to a Puerto Rican drug dealer to falsely implicate Genovese in a drug deal. On April 4, 1959, Genovese was convicted in New York of conspiracy to violate federal narcotics laws. Sent to prison for fifteen years,",
