Scoot Allan of Screen Rant noted that Avengers Assemble aimed primarily at younger audiences, similar to Disney XD's Ultimate Spider-Man . He explained that after two seasons, the show reinvented itself each year with a new team and title to reflect the season's storyline, such as Avengers: Ultron Revolution , Avengers: Secret Wars , and Avengers: Panther's Quest . Allan acknowledged that the series' kid-friendly focus alienated some fans of the previous show, but still considered it one of the best Avengers animated series due to its reinvention and ability to honor established screen portrayals while adding its own unique twist.
