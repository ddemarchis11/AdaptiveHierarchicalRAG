      "text": "Discofox or disco fox is a social partner dance which evolved in Europe in the mid-1970s as a rediscovery of the dance hold in the improvisational disco dance scene dominated by solo dancing, approximately at the same time when the hustle emerged in the United States . Both dances were greatly influenced by Saturday Night Fever starring John Travolta . In various regions, it is also known under different names: disco hustle, swing fox, disco swing, and rock fox. Discofox is popular in Austria , Germany , Poland , Switzerland ,  as well as in Russia .  Discofox may be danced to a wide variety of 2 4 and 4 4 music such as 1970s disco, 1980s Eurodisco , Italo disco , disco polo , pop , and techno . Tempo may vary. In a social setting it is mostly danced in one place, although the couple may also move across the dance floor. It is danced with various types of single and double handhold . Among the figures are various handwraps, spins, throw-outs/catches, poses, drops, and for competitions also acrobatic figures. There are international competitions in discofox.  Basic timing and step The beginner's count of the basic step is \"step-step-tap\". Advanced dancers use the hustle-style split-beat four-step basic (still occupying 3 beats of music), counted variously: (1,2, & 3), (1,2,",

      "text": "Saturday Night Fever is a 1977 American dance drama film directed by John Badham and produced by Robert Stigwood . It stars John Travolta as Tony Manero, a young Italian-American man who spends his weekends dancing and drinking at a local disco while dealing with social tensions and disillusionment in his working class ethnic neighborhood in Brooklyn . The story is based on \" Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night \", a mostly fictional 1976 New York article by music writer Nik Cohn . A major critical and commercial success, Saturday Night Fever had a tremendous impact on the popular culture of the late 1970s. It helped popularize disco around the world and initiated a series of collaborations between film studios and record labels. It made Travolta, already well known from his role in the popular TV sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter , a household name. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, at the time becoming the fourth-youngest nominee in the category. The film showcases aspects of the music, dancing, and subculture surrounding the disco era, including symphony-orchestrated melodies, haute couture styles of clothing, pre- AIDS sexual promiscuity and graceful choreography. The Saturday Night Fever soundtrack , featuring songs by the Bee Gees , is one of the best-selling soundtrack albums worldwide. Travolta reprised his role of Tony Manero in Staying Alive in 1983, which was panned by critics despite being successful at the",

      "text": "The spy's dance references Tony Monero's dancing to \"You Should Be Dancin.'\" The 2018 film Ready Player One features a dance scene that references Saturday Night Fever , particularly the red, yellow, and blue dance floor from the 2001 Odyssey night club in the film. In November 2023, Capital One began airing a holiday-themed commercial titled \"Holiday Night Fever\" which contained an homage to the opening scene of the movie. In the sixty second version, as the Bee Gees' \"Stayin' Alive\" plays over the scene, Santa Claus (a heavily made-up John Travolta) struts down a street that has been mostly cleared of snow after a winter storm. He carries a can of \"magical glitter paint\"; buys two cookies (instead of pizza slices) at a walk-up window and asks \"what happened to three?\" (he was offered three slices in the movie); eats them stacked; then pauses at a shoe store window and compares his shoes to a pair of elven boots with a jingle bell on them; he flirts with a store clerk (Donna Pescow); buys a disco ball Christmas ornament for his sleigh ; throws some of the glitter paint onto a Christmas tree that is set up on the sidewalk; then goes to a disco where he asks how his hair looks and dances on the illuminated floor. The shorter version of the commercial was still being aired as of November 2024. See also 1970s",

The article centers on working class Italian-Americans in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and on the lives of young men who work dead-end jobs but live for their nights dancing at the local discotheque.

      "text": "Two of a Kind is a 1983 American romantic fantasy crime comedy-drama film directed by John Herzfeld and starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John . The film reunited Travolta and Newton-John who had appeared together in 1978's Grease . The original musical score was composed by Patrick Williams . Travolta plays cash-strapped inventor Zack Melon while Newton-John plays Debbie Wylder, the bank teller whom he attempts to rob. They must come to show compassion for one another in order to delay God 's judgment upon the Earth. Despite being a critical failure, the film's soundtrack was a commercial success, yielding three hit singles for Newton-John and being certified Platinum . Plot Four angels — Charlie, Earl, Gonzales, and Ruth — have been in charge of Heaven for the last twenty-five years. They are playing a golf match in Heaven when their game is interrupted by God , who has returned to the office and does not like what he sees down on Earth. God wants to order up another flood and start all over again (despite his promise in the rainbow that he never would again), but the four angels persuade him to reconsider, reasoning that, if a typical Earth man can reform, it would prove that all mankind is capable of it. God agrees to the scheme, and the typical Earth man selected by the angels is Zack Melon, a failed inventor who, threatened by loan sharks , decides to hold up a bank . Zack points his gun",
