Early on in the development process, the filmmakers chose the Deer Lodge, a winter hotel in Banff, Alberta as the primary filming location. For the film's antagonist, filmmakers drew inspiration from the Native American legend of the Wendigo , a cannibalistic spirit that possessed humans, roaming the wilderness in search of human flesh. According to Makichuk, the Wendigo was originally intended to have a more substantial role in the film, but many scenes had to be removed due to budget restraints. Casting The majority of the cast were locally-hired actors in the Calgary area, with the exception being lead Riva Spier, who was an actress hired out of Montreal . For the majority of the cast, Ghostkeeper was their first and final film credit; Georgie Collins was primarily a well-known stage actress in Calgary, and was cast in the role of the mysterious elderly hotel proprietor.
