A live performance of the song is included in Florence and the Machine's live album MTV Unplugged – A Live Album (2012) which was recorded in December 2011. Since then \"Never Let Me Go\" has only been played on one subsequent tour, 2022's Dance Fever Tour and 2026's Everybody Scream Tour This was because Florence \"didn't like it\" because it was a time in her life where she was under pressure writing her second album, and being \"sad, young and drunk\" vowing never to play it again. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic she vowed to bring it back as a thank-you.

      "text": "The OU812 Tour was a concert tour by the American hard rock band Van Halen in support of their studio album OU812 . Background Van Halen began their tour with a United States leg known as the \"Monsters of Rock\" tour through 23 cities alongside Metallica, Scorpions, Dokken and Kingdom Come which would feature a specially constructed stage with lights and state-of-the-art sound equipment. The tour originated when promoter Louis Messina had approached the band and suggested a five-band summer long tour, up to which the band didn't hesitate to sign. In the end, the leg itself was a financial failure, though it would be their most expensive tour. Some of the cities the band performed in during the \"Monsters of Rock\" tour had however shown some success while there was confusion from the promoters where the tour didn't do well, bringing up speculation that the album wasn't familiar with the audience yet, while others stated that the shows were on a weekday while school was going on. During the show in East Troy, Hagar fell during the opening song on the set, receiving a minor tailbone fracture. Despite his injury, he did finish the performance. Following the Monsters of Rock tour, the band did go on a brief hiatus before continuing the tour. On the second North American leg, Van Halen performed in smaller venues, wrapping up the tour with shows in Japan and Hawaii. Reception Mark Madden, a staff writer from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette gave the performance",

The virtual Gorillaz members \"performed\" at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2005 and again at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2006, appearing to perform on stage via Musion Eyeliner technology. Albarn later expressed disappointment at the execution of the performance, citing the low volume level required so as to not disturb the technology: \"That was tough... They started and it was so quiet cause they've got this piece of film that you've got to pull over the stage so any bass frequencies would just mess up the illusion completely.\" At the Grammys, the band won Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for \"Feel Good Inc.\", which was also nominated for Record of the Year . Albarn and Hewlett explored the idea of producing a full \"live holographic tour\" featuring the virtual Gorillaz appearing on stage with Musion Eyeliner technology after the Grammys performance, but the tour was ultimately never realised due to the tremendous expense and logistical issues that would have resulted. In October 2006 the band released the book Rise of the Ogre . Presented as an autobiography of the band ostensibly written by the fictional members and expanding on the band's fictional backstory and universe, the book was actually written by official Gorillaz script writer and live drummer Cass Browne and featured new artwork by Hewlett.
