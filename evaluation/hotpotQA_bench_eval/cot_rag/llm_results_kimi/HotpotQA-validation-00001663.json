Ultimately, Volvo introduced three models in the compact premium segment: the XC40/EX40, the EC40, and the Polestar 2. The XC40, launched in 2017, became Volvo's primary compact model, while the fully electric EC40 followed in 2023. Meanwhile, the Polestar 2, introduced in 2020, served as a sedan-like alternative under Volvo's performance brand, Polestar. However, a direct sedan or station wagon successor to the S40 and V50 was never produced.

Its safety features included forward collision warning , blind spot monitor and alert, lane departure warning , adaptive cruise control , flashing brake lights during hard braking, and headlights that follow the curvature of the road as the car turns. Many of these features would become commonplace years later. The SCC also featured a head-up display and communication with the car via mobile phone.

However, as Audi had already reserved the \"S4\" name, Volvo opted to name the range S40 (saloon), and V40 (estate). These cars were manufactured at the Nedcar factory at Born in the Netherlands (a pre Ford joint venture between Volvo and Mitsubishi Motors ) and based on a common platform with the Mitsubishi Carisma , later used by the Proton Waja .
