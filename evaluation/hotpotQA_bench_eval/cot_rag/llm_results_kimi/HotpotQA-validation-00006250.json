Animation-related jokes are prevalent in the show, such as the Manhattan Madness cartoon in \" The Day the Violence Died \", which is based on very early animated cartoons such as Gertie the Dinosaur . The cartoons also occasionally serve to play out an exaggerated form of the conflict in the surrounding episode. For example, in \" Deep Space Homer \" ( season five , 1994), Homer is recruited by NASA , and later watches an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon which directly (and gruesomely) parodies the films 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien . Fictional production history Several full episodes of The Simpsons were centered on the fictional production history of The Itchy & Scratchy Show . It begins with Chester J. Lampwick creating Itchy the mouse for the now- lost silent cartoon Manhattan Madness , in which Itchy brutally attacks and kills an Irishman and Theodore Roosevelt , in 1919 (the year of the first Felix the Cat cartoon). However, the character was later stolen by Roger Meyers. Scratchy starred in his first cartoon in 1928 titled That Happy Cat . The film, a 13-second-long animation showing the cat whistling and tipping his hat, was a commercial failure. Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first cartoon together called Steamboat Itchy , a violent parody of Disney 's Steamboat Willie . Along with the cartoon shorts,",

Design \"On Batman , our vision of Gotham City was influenced by the tone of the 'Dark Knight' comics, and also Andreas Feininger 's photographs of New York buildings and the work of Japanese architect Shin Takamatsu . ( Blade Runner was consciously avoided as a reference; no one was allowed to watch it while we were designing the film and neon was shunned altogether!)\" —Art director Nigel Phelps Burton had been impressed with the design of Neil Jordan 's The Company of Wolves (1984), but was unable to hire its production designer Anton Furst for Beetlejuice as he had instead committed to Jordan's London-filmed ghost comedy High Spirits (1988), a choice he later regretted. A year later Burton successfully hired Furst for Batman , and they enjoyed working with each other. \"I don't think I've ever felt so naturally in tune with a director,\" Furst said. \"Conceptually, spiritually, visually, or artistically. There was never any problem because we never fought over anything. Texture, attitude and feelings are what Burton is a master at.\" Furst and the art department deliberately mixed clashing architectural styles to \"make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable\". Furst continued, \"[W]e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission . A city run by crime, with a riot",
