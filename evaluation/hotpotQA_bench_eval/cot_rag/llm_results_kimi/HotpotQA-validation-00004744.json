Musical style Along with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers , the Yardbirds were part of the British blues scene of the 1960s. As the blues rock genre developed, some acts like Chicken Shack were playing a louder and more aggressive style, while the Yardbirds emphasized instrumental textures and extended instrumental improvisations. They covered blues classics like Howlin' Wolf 's \" Smokestack Lightning \" (1956) and Bo Diddley 's 1955 \" I'm a Man \" which had a repetitive structure where instrumental solos were brief breaks between repetition of verses. The Yardbirds often extended these instrumental sections into \"heavy jams\".

Bo Diddley was honored by the Mississippi Blues Commission with a Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker placed in McComb , his birthplace, in recognition of his enormous contribution to the development of the blues in Mississippi. On June 5, 2009, the city of Gainesville, Florida, officially renamed and dedicated its downtown plaza the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. The plaza was the site of a benefit concert at which Bo Diddley performed to raise awareness about the plight of the homeless in Alachua County and to raise money for local charities, including the Red Cross . Beat The \"Bo Diddley beat\" is essentially the clave rhythm , one of the most common bell patterns found in sub-Saharan African music traditions . One scholar found this rhythm in 13 rhythm and blues recordings made in the years 1944–55, including two by Johnny Otis from 1948. Bo Diddley gave different accounts of how he began to use this rhythm. Ned Sublette says, \"In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], 'Bo Diddley' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'Rhumba' on the track sheets.\" The Bo Diddley beat is similar to \"",

Soon after Clapton joined John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers , Jeff Beck replaced him. The band first approached Jimmy Page, but content with his lucrative sessions work, and worried about both his health and the politics of Clapton's departure, Page recommended his friend Jeff Beck. Beck played his first gig with the Yardbirds two days after Clapton's departure. Beck line-up (1965–1966) The Yardbirds in 1965. Clockwise from top: Jeff Beck, Paul Samwell-Smith, Chris Dreja, Jim McCarty, Keith Relf. Beck's exploration of fuzz tone, reverb, feedback, sustain, distortion, and hammer-on soloing fitted well into the increasingly raw style of British beat music. The Yardbirds began to experiment with eclectic arrangements reminiscent of Gregorian chants and various European and Asian styles while Beck infused a pervasive Middle Eastern influence into the mix. Beck was voted No. 1 lead guitarist of 1966 in the British music magazine Beat Instrumental . The Beck-era Yardbirds produced many groundbreaking recordings, including the hit singles \" Heart Full of Soul \", \" Evil Hearted You \"/\"Still I'm Sad\", a cover of Bo Diddley's \" I'm a Man \" (US only), \" Shapes of Things \", and \" Over Under Sideways Down \", and the Yardbirds album",
