Baza Lotnicza ) ( ICAO : EPLK ) is a Polish Air Force base, located in Łask , about 30 km south-west of Łódź . It is one of the two bases where Poland 's F-16 fighters are stationed, the other being 31st Air Base . 9 of them were first moved there in October 2008. The goal is to have 16 fighters, operated by the 10th Tactical Squadron . A detachment of the US Air Force has been permanently based at Łask since November, 2012. Additional units rotate to the base periodically to conduct training exercises. The force is thought to be nuclear-capable and has joined nuclear exercises with NATO . The base airfield was built in 1957. The current base unit, combining infrastructure and ground personnel, was formed in 2001. In the past there were plans to use this airfield for civilian airliners, but with the expansion of nearby Łódź Władysław Reymont Airport these have been shelved.

Of the 22 MiG-29s Poland received from the German Air Force in 2004, a total of 14 were overhauled and taken into service. They were used to equip the 41st Tactical Squadron ( 41. elt ), replacing its MiG-21s. As of 2008, Poland was the biggest NATO MiG-29 user. Poland had 31 active MiG-29s (25 MiG-29As, six MiG-29UBs) as of 2017. They are stationed with the 1st Tactical Squadron at the 23rd Air Base near Mińsk Mazowiecki and the 41st TS at the 22nd Air Base near Malbork . There have been unconfirmed reports that Poland has at one point leased a MiG-29 from its own inventory to Israel for evaluation and the aircraft has since been returned to Poland, as suggested by photographs of a MiG-29 in Israeli use. Three Polish MiG-29As were reported in Israel for evaluation between April and May 1997 in the Negev Desert .  On 7 September 2011, the Polish Air",

After the Russian invasion in February 2022, three Azerbaijani Air Force MiG-29s undergoing overhauls were transferred to the Ukrainian Air Force , bolstering the total of aircraft operated by the 40th and 204th Tactical Aviation Brigades from around 55 to 58. In April 2014, during the Russian invasion of Crimea , 45 Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29s and 4 L-39 combat trainers were reportedly captured by Russian forces at Belbek air base . Most of the planes appeared to be in inoperable condition. In May, Russian troops dismantled them and shipped them back to Ukraine. On 4 August 2014, the Ukrainian government stated that a number of them had been put back into service to fight in the war in the east of the country. During the initial days of the war in Donbas in April 2014, the Ukrainian Air Force deployed some jet fighters over the Donetsk region to perform combat air patrols and show of force flights. Probably due to the limited number of jet fighters available, a MiG-29 belonging to the Ukrainian Falcons display team was spotted armed with a full air-to-air load and performing a low altitude",

      "text": "The Mikoyan MiG-29 ( Russian : Микоян МиГ-29 ; NATO reporting name : Fulcrum ) is a twin-engine fighter aircraft designed in the Soviet Union . Developed by the Mikoyan design bureau as an air superiority fighter during the 1970s, the MiG-29, along with the larger Sukhoi Su-27 , was developed to counter U.S. fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon . The MiG-29 entered service with the Soviet Air Forces in 1983. While originally oriented towards combat against any enemy aircraft, many MiG-29s have been furnished as multirole fighters capable of performing a number of different operations, and are commonly outfitted to use a range of air-to-surface armaments and precision munitions . The MiG-29 has been manufactured in several major variants, including the multirole Mikoyan MiG-29M and the navalised Mikoyan MiG-29K ; the most advanced member of the family to date is the Mikoyan MiG-35 . Later models frequently feature improved engines, glass cockpits with HOTAS (\"hands-on-throttle-and-stick\")-compatible flight controls, modern radar and infrared search and track (IRST) sensors, and considerably increased fuel capacity; some aircraft have also been equipped for aerial refueling .
