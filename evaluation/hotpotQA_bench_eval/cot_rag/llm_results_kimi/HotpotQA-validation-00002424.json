      "text": "The Passion of the Christ is a 2004 American epic biblical drama film co-produced and directed by Mel Gibson from a screenplay he wrote with Benedict Fitzgerald . It stars Jim Caviezel as Jesus , Maia Morgenstern as his mother Mary , and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene . It depicts the arrest, trial and crucifixion of Jesus , largely according to the canonical gospels as well as additional accounts such as the purported mystical visions by Anne Catherine Emmerich and the Friday of Sorrows . The film primarily covers the final twelve hours before Jesus Christ's death, known as \"the Passion\". It begins with the Agony in the Garden of Olives (i.e., Gethsemane), continues with the betrayal of Judas Iscariot , the Flagellation of Christ , the suffering of Mary as prophesied by Simeon , the crucifixion and death of Jesus , and ends with a brief depiction of his resurrection . The narrative is interspersed with moments in Jesus's life, such as the Last Supper and the Sermon on the Mount , and moments of Jesus' early life. The film was mostly shot in Italy. The dialogue is entirely in reconstructed Aramaic , Hebrew , and Latin . Although Gibson was initially against it, the film is subtitled.

Bellucci's agent advised her against appearing in this film due to its potential failure because its distribution was undetermined at the time. Bellucci ignored her agent's suggestion and rejected another film offer. Gibson chose Bellucci for the role because they \"liked each other\". She wanted to portray the character as \"strong and deep\" but no-one believed the film would succeed. Eventually, Bellucci played an expressive Mary Magdalene in Gibson's Christian drama The Passion of the Christ (2004), which depicts the final hours of the life of Jesus Christ. The film includes dialogue in Aramaic and Latin , languages Bellucci had to quickly learn. The New York Times film critic A. O. Scott said Bellucci was the only exception to the \"absence of identifiable movie stars\". Expressing a similar opinion, Le Monde said in the film portraying a fundamentalist view of the Gospel , Bellucci stands out from the cast list the most.

In Terry Gilliam 's fantasy adventure film The Brothers Grimm (2005), Bellucci played the 500-year-old Mirror Queen, starring opposite Matt Damon and Heath Ledger . Gilliam later said: \"[i]mmediately she comes on-screen, it seems to me the whole film lifts up into another realm, a realm of sex and sensuality and danger\". San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle said Bellucci convincingly portrayed her character, whose centuries-old age appeared to him to be discordant with her \"allure\".
