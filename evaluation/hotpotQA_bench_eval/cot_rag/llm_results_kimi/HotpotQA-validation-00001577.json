It was headquartered in Didsbury , Manchester, England, it operated a network of domestic and European services from a number of airports in the United Kingdom on behalf of British Airways . The airline operated as a low-cost carrier , with food sold via a ' buy on board ' programme (except for flights to London City Airport ). On 3 November 2006, British Airways announced the sale of BA Connect to Flybe . It formally transferred to Flybe on 25 March 2007.

On 30 July 1993 the company was renamed Brymon Airways Limited to reflect the operating name. The company was purchased by British Airways in 1993 and on 28 March 2002 it was merged with British Regional Airlines and was renamed British Airways Citiexpress Ltd operating as BA CitiExpress .

On 1 February 2006 the airline was renamed BA Connect Limited operating as BA Connect and operations moved to a low-cost carrier model, with food sold via a ' buy on board ' programme (except for flights to London City Airport ). However, allocated seating and a baggage valet service were still available, while lounge access, tier points and BA Miles remained unaffected for those in the Executive Club. Operationally the new service came into effect on 26 March 2006. BAe 146-200 departing Manchester Airport in 2007 BA Connect handled most of British Airways' domestic and European services that do not serve London’s Heathrow or Gatwick airports. It had hubs in Birmingham , Bristol , London–City , Manchester and Southampton . From these locations the carrier operated services to several northwest European destinations and also to Glasgow , Edinburgh and Aberdeen . A few services also operated from Gatwick. In total, BA Connect flew from 17 airports in the UK and Ireland on 63 routes to major or central regional airports. On 3 November 2006, British Airways chief executive said that he had reached an agreement for Flybe to purchase BA Connect. BA would ensure that Flybe has sufficient funding in order to achieve its growth targets and the transition out of current BA Connect fleet.

      "text": "In return BA would acquire a 15% stake in the new business. The acquisition (which did not include BA Connect routes to London City or from Manchester to New York) would significantly increase the Flybe route network in both the UK and continental Europe, making Flybe the largest regional airline in Europe. Retention of the London City routes would result in BA retaining the RJ100 aircraft for these domestic and European services. BA had to pay Flybe a sum of money to take on the company due to Flybe actually taking on a company that would cost them money rather than make profits for the foreseeable future. Much concern was expressed at the shedding of routes across Scotland, but Flybe stated that BA Connect routes would be kept and expanded. On 6 March 2007 Flybe stated that they would not be operating any former BA Connect services from Bristol. Consequently, the last flights on any of BA Connect's routes from Bristol was on 24 March 2007. Services BA Connect operated from several destinations that were also served by the parent company, and were part of British Airways destinations . Those that were not served by British Airways itself, mainly UK regional destinations, are listed in British Airways franchise destinations .

      "text": "Didsbury is a suburb of Manchester , England, on the north bank of the River Mersey , 5 miles (8 kilometres) south of Manchester city centre . The population at the 2011 census was 26,788. Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire , there are records of Didsbury existing as a small hamlet as early as the 13th century. Its early history was dominated by being part of the Manor of Withington , a feudal estate that covered a large part of what is now the south of Manchester. Didsbury was described during the 18th century as a township separate from outside influence. In 1745 a section of the Jacobite army including the Duke of Perth crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby. Didsbury was largely rural until the mid-19th century, when it underwent development and urbanisation during the Industrial Revolution . It became part of Manchester in 1904. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was formed in Didsbury in 1889. History Toponymy Didsbury derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon Dyddi's burg , probably referring to a man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township it was on a low cliff overlooking a place where the River Mersey could be forded. In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre,",
