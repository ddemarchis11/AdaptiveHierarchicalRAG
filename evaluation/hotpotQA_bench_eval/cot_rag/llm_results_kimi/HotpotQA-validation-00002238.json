      "text": "The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bamenda is the metropolitan see of the ecclesiastical province of Bamenda in Cameroon . It was by the bull Tametsi Christianarum , of 13 August 1970, that Pope Paul VI erected the Diocese of Bamenda with territory detached from the Diocese of Buéa. On 18 March 1982 Pope John Paul II created, by the bull Eo Magis Ecclesia Catholica , the Archdiocese of Bamenda and the Ecclesiastical Province of Bamenda, and erected the Diocese of Kumbo with territory detached from the Diocese of Bamenda. Bamenda was by the same bull made into the metropolitan see of the ecclesiastical province with Buéa and Kumbo as its suffragans. Mamfe was later created into a diocese with territory detached from Buéa. Bamenda, therefore, has three suffragan sees: Buéa, Kumbo and Mamfe. As of November 2013 there are 35 parishes in Bamenda divided into six deaneries: Njinikom, Mankon, Widikum, Bambui, Wum and Ndop.

Sarum Use The Sarum Rite (more properly called Sarum Use ) was a variant of the Roman Rite widely used for the ordering of Christian public worship, including the Mass and the Divine Office . It was established by Saint Osmund , Bishop of Salisbury in the 11th century and was originally the local form used in the Cathedral and Diocese of Salisbury; it later became prevalent throughout southern England and came to be used throughout most of England, Wales, Ireland and later Scotland until the reign of Queen Mary. Although abandoned after the 16th century, it was also a notable influence on the pattern of Anglican liturgy represented in the Book of Common Prayer . Occasional interest in and attempts at restoration of the liturgy by Anglicans and Catholics have not produced a general revival, however.
