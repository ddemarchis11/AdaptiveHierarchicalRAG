On larger scales, such drinks are often commercially made in larger machines and come in various flavors with various alcohol or liquors. Another way to create a frozen daiquiri (mostly fruit-flavored variants) is by using frozen limeade , providing the required texture, sweetness and sourness all at once.

The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore by body mass, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species is sexually dimorphic , as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water. Polar bears are both terrestrial and pagophilic (ice-living) and are considered marine mammals because of their dependence on marine ecosystems . They prefer the annual sea ice but live on land when the ice melts in the summer. They are mostly carnivorous and specialized for preying on seals , particularly ringed seals . Such prey is typically taken by ambush; the bear may stalk its prey on the ice or in the water, but also will stay at a breathing hole or ice edge to wait for prey to swim by. The bear primarily feeds on the seal's energy-rich blubber . Other prey include walruses , beluga whales and some terrestrial animals. Polar bears are usually solitary",

      "text": "of a \"polar bear king\" known as the bjarndýrakóngur . This beast was depicted as a polar bear with \"ruddy cheeks\" and a unicorn -like horn, which glows in the dark. The king could understand when humans talk and was considered to be very astute. Two Norwegian fairy tales, \" East of the Sun and West of the Moon \" and \" White-Bear-King-Valemon \", involve white bears turning into men and seducing women. Drawings of polar bears have been featured on maps of the northern regions. Possibly the earliest depictions of a polar bear on a map is the Swedish Carta marina of 1539, which has a white bear on Iceland or \"Islandia\". A 1544 map of North America includes two polar bears near Quebec . Notable paintings featuring polar bears include François-Auguste Biard 's Fighting Polar Bears (1839) and Edwin Landseer 's Man Proposes, God Disposes (1864). Polar bears have also been filmed for cinema. An Inuit polar bear hunt was shot for the 1932 documentary Igloo , while the 1974 film The White Dawn filmed a simulated stabbing of a trained bear for a scene. In the film The Big Show (1961), two characters are killed by a circus polar bear. The scenes were shot using animal trainers instead of the actors. In modern literature, polar bears have been characters in both",

      "text": "The daiquiri ( / ˈ d aɪ k ər i , ˈ d æ k -/ ; Spanish : daiquirí [dajkiˈɾi] ) is a cocktail whose main ingredients are rum , citrus juice (typically lime juice ), and sugar or other sweetener. The daiquiri is one of the six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury 's classic The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , which also lists some variations. Origins Daiquirí is also the name of a beach and an iron mine near Santiago de Cuba in eastern Cuba, and is a word of Taíno origin. Historians widely agree that the cocktail was invented by an American mining engineer named Jennings Cox , who was in Cuba (then at the tail-end of the Spanish Captaincy-General government ) at the time of the Spanish–American War of 1898. It is also possible that William A. Chanler , a US congressman who purchased the Santiago iron mines in 1902, introduced the daiquiri to clubs in New York in that year. Originally the drink was served in a tall glass packed with cracked ice. A teaspoon of sugar was poured over the ice, and the juice of one or two limes was squeezed over the sugar. Two or three ounces of white rum completed the mixture. The glass was then frosted with a long-handled spoon . Later the daiquiri evolved to be mixed in a shaker with",

Polar bears are usually solitary but can be found in groups when on land. During the breeding season, male bears guard females and defend them from rivals. Mothers give birth to cubs in maternity dens during the winter. Young stay with their mother for up to two and a half years. The polar bear is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with an estimated total population of 22,000 to 31,000 individuals. Its biggest threats are climate change , pollution and energy development. Climate change has caused a decline in sea ice , giving the polar bear less access to its favoured prey and increasing the risk of malnutrition and starvation. Less sea ice also means that the bears must spend more time on land, increasing conflicts with humans. Polar bears have been hunted, both by native and non-native peoples, for their coats, meat and other items. They have been kept in captivity in zoos and circuses and are prevalent in art, folklore, religion and modern culture. Naming The polar bear was given its common name by Thomas Pennant in A Synopsis of Quadrupeds (1771). It was known as the \"white bear\" in Europe between the 13th and 18th centuries, as well as \"ice bear\", \"sea bear\" and \" Greenland bear\". The Norse referred to it as",

In modern literature, polar bears have been characters in both children's fiction , like Hans Beer's Little Polar Bear and the Whales and Sakiasi Qaunaq's The Orphan and the Polar Bear , and fantasy novels, like Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials series. In radio, Mel Blanc provided the vocals for Jack Benny 's pet polar bear Carmichael on The Jack Benny Program . The polar bear is featured on flags and coats of arms, like the coat of arms of Greenland , and in many advertisements, notably for Coca-Cola since 1922. As charismatic megafauna , polar bears have been used to raise awareness of the dangers of climate change. Aurora the polar bear is a giant marionette created by Greenpeace for climate protests. The World Wide Fund for Nature has sold plush polar bears as part of its \"Arctic Home\" campaign. Photographs of polar bears have been featured in National Geographic and Time magazines, including ones of them standing on ice floes, while the climate change documentary and advocacy film An Inconvenient Truth (2006) includes an animated bear swimming. Automobile manufacturer Nissan used a polar bear in one of its commercials, hugging a man for using an electric car. To make a statement about global warming, in 2009 a Copenhagen ice statue of a polar bear with a bronze skeleton was purposely left to melt in the sun. See",
