      "text": "The City of New Orleans is a long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak in the Central United States between Chicago and New Orleans . The overnight train takes about 19 1 ⁄ 2 hours to complete its 934-mile (1,503 km) route, making major stops in Champaign–Urbana , Carbondale , Memphis , and Jackson as well as in other small towns. The City of New Orleans was first initiated by the Illinois Central Railroad in 1947 as the daytime complement to the Panama Limited , a night train dating back to 1911. In 1971 both routes were conveyed to Amtrak, which retained only the Panama Limited . In 1981 Amtrak revived the City of New Orleans name for the train, still on an overnight schedule, on the heels of the popular song of the same name by Steve Goodman . Additional corridor service on the northern segment of the route is provided by the Illini and Saluki between Chicago and Carbondale, Illinois. The City of New Orleans is the only Amtrak train to serve Tennessee . During fiscal year 2023, the train carried 233,876 passengers, an increase of 50.3% from FY2022. In FY2016, the last year that route-specific revenue data was given, the train had a total revenue of $ 18,706,915, a 3.7% decrease from FY2015. History Illinois Central IC #4017, an EMD",

      "text": "in 1967. Amtrak City of New Orleans , October 2005 When Amtrak assumed operation of U.S. passenger train service on May 1, 1971, it dropped the Panama Limited in favor of retaining the City of New Orleans on the traditional daytime schedule. At that time the City of New Orleans was one of four trains that called at Chicago's Central Station , which was originally Illinois Central's terminal in Chicago. All Amtrak trains were consolidated to Union Station by March 1972. Inauspiciously, the City of New Orleans was involved in Amtrak's first fatal derailment on June 10, near Salem, Illinois . Because this train made no connections with other trains at either New Orleans or Chicago, Amtrak moved the train to an overnight schedule on November 14, 1971, and renamed it the Panama Limited . In February 1981, Amtrak restored the City of New Orleans name while retaining the overnight schedule; Amtrak hoped to capitalize on the popularity of the song written by Steve Goodman and recorded in 1972 by Arlo Guthrie . A Kansas City section, the River Cities , began operation on April 29, 1984. It separated from the City of New Orleans at Centralia, Illinois (later Carbondale) and ran to Kansas City via St. Louis. This section ended on November 4, 1994. The northbound City of New Orleans began stopping at Gilman, Illinois , on",

The Illinois Central Railroad introduced the original City of New Orleans on April 27, 1947. It was a daytime, all-coach companion to the overnight Panama Limited , which had been all- Pullman for most of its run. EMD E7 diesel locomotives pulled new lightweight Pullman Company coaches. The 921-mile (1,482 km) route, which the City of New Orleans covered in 15 hours 55 minutes, was the longest daytime schedule in the United States. The City of New Orleans exchanged St. Louis —New Orleans through cars at Carbondale, Illinois and Louisville —New Orleans cars at Fulton, Kentucky . The average speed of the new train was nearly 60 mph (97 km/h) with a maximum of 100 mph (160 km/h); a result of the largely flat route of the Illinois Central along the Mississippi River . By October 25, 1959, the timetable had lengthened to 16 hours 30 minutes. The train remained popular throughout the 1960s and gained ex- Missouri Pacific Railroad dome coaches in 1967.

Club wrote that while the two lead actors had done good work elsewhere they were \"atrocious\" in this film, \"He's irritatingly smarmy, she's abrasively sassy, and together they're insufferable.\" Rabin concluded, \"This should be avoided by all\". Rebecca Murray, writing for About.com , disagreed and gave Overnight Delivery a more positive review. She stated that the movie did not receive the attention it deserved by going straight to video, and it should have been given a better shot. \"I actually laughed out loud at parts of Overnight Delivery and wish it had been given a better shot at [the] theatrical run.\" References External links Overnight Delivery at IMDb",
