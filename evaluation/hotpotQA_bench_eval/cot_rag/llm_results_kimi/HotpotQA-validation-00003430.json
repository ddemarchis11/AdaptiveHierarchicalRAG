Robyn also re-introduced The Australian Women's Weekly Book Club which was launched at an event in Sydney in 2008 by award-winning writer Di Morrissey , who had begun her career as a cadet at The Australian Women's Weekly. Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) launched Women's Weekly versions in Singapore (1997) and Malaysia in 2000. The magazine in each country follows the Australian Weekly 's writing style, while its content is idiosyncratic to the country. In 2012 the parent company of the magazine, ACP Magazines , a subsidiary of Nine Entertainment , was acquired by the Bauer Media Group . Audited circulation under Nene King was 980,000. The 60th anniversary edition sold in excess of one-million. Audited circulation in June 2013 was 459,175 copies monthly. Readership numbers for September 2014 were estimated to be 1,828,000. In mid-June 2020, the Sydney –based investment company Mercury Capital acquired The Australian Women's Weekly as part of its acquisition of Bauer Media's Australian and New Zealand magazine brands. In late September 2020, Mercury Capital rebranded Bauer Media as Are Media , which took over publication of the Woman's Weekly .

      "text": "The Australian Women's Weekly , sometimes known simply as The Weekly , is an Australian monthly women's magazine published by Are Media in Sydney and founded in 1933. For many years it was the number one magazine in Australia before being outsold by the Australian edition of Better Homes and Gardens in 2014. As of February 2019 [update] , The Weekly has overtaken Better Homes and Gardens again, coming out on top as Australia's most read magazine. The magazine invested in the 2020 film I Am Woman about Helen Reddy , singer and feminist icon. History and profile The magazine was started in 1933 by Frank Packer and Ted Theodore as a weekly publication. The first editor was George Warnecke and the initial dummy was laid out by William Edwin Pidgeon who went on to do many famous covers over the next 25 years. It was to have two distinctive features; firstly, the newspaper's features would have an element of topicality, and secondly the magazine would appeal to all Australian women, regardless of class, and have a national focus. Wanting it to appeal to a mass audience, Warnecke hoped The Weekly would be a sign that Australia finally was coming out of the Depression . Jean Williamson was hired (moving from the Sydney Morning Herald ) where she was surprised to find that she was the editor for \"fiction\". Soon letters were arriving from women who were obviously lonely and light fiction brought them comfort. In the coming decades, The Weekly",

      "text": "Cultural impact The overall popularity of the magazine between the 1930s–1980s meant that articles and advertisements published in it were widely read across Australia , not only by women, but men as well. The magazine's power to influence and shape culture across the nation intersected with the rise of various women's and parenting issues. In a review of issues published between the 1930s–1980s, historians have argued that The Australian Women's Weekly promoted school uniforms for children at a time when school uniforms were not mandatory across the country. This promotion, mainly through targeted coverage of school aged children, shaped views of motherhood and child-rearing throughout Australia. Publications in the magazine focused on products, children's fashion, and celebrity children continue to shape readers views of motherhood and child-rearing. Format and frequency The magazine is usually 240 pages long and printed on glossy paper trimmed to A4 page size , although it was originally a tabloid in size and layout. It typically contains feature articles about the modern Australian woman. For many years, it included a lift-out TV guide. In 1982, publication frequency was reduced from weekly to monthly. \"Weekly\" was retained in the name for reasons of familiarity and because a woman's \"monthly\" was a slang term for menstruation . The final weekly edition was dated 15 December 1982, followed by the first monthly edition dated January 1983. The TV guide was discontinued on introduction of the monthly format.",
