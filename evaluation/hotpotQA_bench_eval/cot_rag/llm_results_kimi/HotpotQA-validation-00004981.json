At the time of its launch it received high popularity amongst DStv subscribers, especially in South Africa and Nigeria. Thus the launching of a sister channel, Africa Magic Plus, was made possible.

      "text": "Lagos is classified as a Medium-Port Megacity. Lagos emerged as a home to the Awori people , an Ijebu subgroup of the Yoruba of West Africa , in the 15th century, which is contained across the present-day Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) of Lagos Island , Eti-Osa , Amuwo-Odofin , and Apapa . Before the 15th century, the Awori settled on a farmstead along the coastal line, in and around which they worked and lived. Farmstead translates to Ereko in Yoruba, from which comes the Lagos indigenous name Eko . The lands are separated by creeks, fringing the southwest mouth of Lagos Lagoon , while being protected from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands and long sand spits such as Bar Beach , which stretch up to 100 km (62 mi) east and west of the mouth. Due to rapid urbanisation, the city expanded to the west of the lagoon to include areas in the present-day Lagos Mainland , Ajeromi-Ifelodun , and Surulere . This led to the classification of Lagos into two main areas: the Island , which was the original city of Lagos, and the Mainland , which it has since expanded into. This city area was governed directly by the Federal Government through the Lagos City Council until the creation of Lagos State in 1967, which led to the splitting of Lagos city into the present-day seven",
