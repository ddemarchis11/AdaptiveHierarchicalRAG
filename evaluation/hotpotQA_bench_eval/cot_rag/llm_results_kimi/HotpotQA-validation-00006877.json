He co-starred with Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli in the musical Lucky Lady (1975), directed by Stanley Donen , a notorious flop. After making the neo-noir thriller The Domino Principle (1977) for Stanley Kramer , Hackman was part of an all-star cast in the war film A Bridge Too Far (1977), playing Polish General Stanisław Sosabowski , and was an officer in the French Foreign Legion in March or Die (1977). Hackman showed a talent for both comedy and the \"slow burn\" as criminal mastermind Lex Luthor opposite Christopher Reeve in the leading role in the superhero film Superman: The Movie (1978). Ron Pennington of The Hollywood Reporter wrote of his performance, \"Hackman plays Lex Luthor, 'the greatest criminal mind of our time,' with an effective light touch, making him humorous but not out-and-out comical.\" He reprised the role for two of its sequels, Superman II (1980) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987). 1980–1999: Established career and acclaim Gene is someone who is a very intuitive and instinctive actor ... The brilliance of Gene Hackman is that he can look at a scene and he can cut through to what is necessary, and he does it with extraordinary economy –",

In Zack Snyder 's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice , Lex is named after his father, Alexander Luthor Sr. , the founder of LexCorp and an oil and machinery tycoon immigrant from East Germany who died in 2000. When confronting Superman, Lex mentions his father's abusive behavior in his childhood.

      "text": "The comic book features a battle with the failed prototype of Nuclear Man resembling Bizarro and an around-the-world fight with the second Nuclear Man. The adaptation has an alternate ending with Superman and Jeremy flying above Earth, observing that the planet is, in reality, just one world, rather than the divided world one sees on a man-made map. In the adaptation, Jeremy is seen in orbit with a space suit but in the deleted footage from the film, Jeremy (portrayed by Damian McLawthorn) is not wearing any vacuum protection of any kind, as was Lacy Warfield when she was rescued from the second Nuclear Man by Superman. The alternate ending appears in the Deluxe Edition DVD, incorporated in the deleted footage section. There was also a book novelization written by Bonnie Bryant , in which scenes based on deleted footage are included. The novelization was released in 1987, along with the premiere of the film.

      "text": "Lex Luthor: Man of Steel (later collected as simply Luthor ) is a five-issue monthly American comic book limited series written by Brian Azzarello and illustrated by Lee Bermejo , which features Superman 's nemesis Lex Luthor as the protagonist. The story explores Luthor's motivations behind being a constant foe to the Man of Steel inside a city that has largely embraced him. Luthor views Superman as a demigod who looks down on humanity and believes that in order to \"save\" the human race from extraterrestrial threats, Superman must be stopped. Plot The story is narrated from Lex Luthor 's point of view, depicting him much differently than the ruthless, corrupt killer that readers are accustomed to. Luthor charitably invites a loyal employee to the grand opening of his Science Spire, a new Metropolis attraction under construction. Luthor watches footage of Superman engaging criminals with heat vision and wonders to himself why the public invests so much trust in an alien simply because he looks human. In Chechnya, Elias Orr , one of Lex's operatives, leads a group of mercenaries in a raid to free a Russian scientist named Sasha Federov, whom Luthor enlists in a new project. During a business meeting, Luthor learns the Science Spire has gone over budget. He stuns LexCorp executives by tossing out his previous business plan and undercutting union demands by making the project non-profit. In a LexCorp lab, he meets with",
