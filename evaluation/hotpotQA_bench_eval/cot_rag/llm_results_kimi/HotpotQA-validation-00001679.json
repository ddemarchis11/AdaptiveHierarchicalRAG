In October 2022, Norton was involved in controversy over comments he made in an interview with Mariella Frostrup at the Cheltenham Literature Festival . He expressed scepticism over the existence of cancel culture , arguing that \"I think the word should be 'accountability'.\" When Frostrup countered that J. K. Rowling had been \"deluged with ... anger, rage and attempts at censorship\" over her views on transgender rights , Norton responded that it would be better to \"talk to trans people, talk to the parents of trans kids, talk to doctors\" about the issue than to celebrities like himself. Rowling criticised Norton's comments on Twitter , citing him as part of a \"recent spate of bearded men stepping confidently onto their soapboxes to define what a woman is and throw their support behind rape and death threats to those who dare disagree\". Following further criticism on Twitter from supporters of Rowling, Norton deactivated his Twitter account.
