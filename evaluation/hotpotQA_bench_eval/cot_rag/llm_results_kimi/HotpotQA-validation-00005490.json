As he turns round to face her, she suddenly realizes that the \"Captain\" is actually Arlecchino and begins reproaching him for his faithlessness, only pausing to powder her face. In response Arlecchino delivers a short speech concerning his views on marriage and fidelity: Die Treue, Madame, ist ein Laster, das meiner Ehrsamkeit nicht ansteht. – \"Fealty, madame, is a vice which does not apply to my respectability.\" 5b. Arietta. Arlecchino concludes by asking Colombina how she sleeps. Colombina changes her tune. Singing in alternating 3/4 and 2/4, she attempts to flatter Arlecchino, describing how other women envy her position as his wife. She then sings of her own virtues as a wife: she can dance and sing, and play the tambourine. As Colombina nestles up to him, Arlecchino, not taken in by her ploy, says: O Colombina, siehst du jenen Stern? - \"Oh Colombina, dost thou see yonder star?\" As Colombina gazes up at the night sky, he quickly makes his escape. 6.

ARLECCHINO als Sieger [Arlecchino as Conqueror] (Allegretto sostenuto) The roles in Arlecchino are derived from the Italian commedia dell'arte . It is unusual in that the title role of Arlecchino is primarily a speaking role. The composer has said that Arlecchino \"has a tendency to ambiguity and hyperbole in order to place the listener momentarily in a position of slight doubt.\" Ronald Stevenson has described it as an \"anti-opera,\" and an \"anti-war satire.\" Guido M. Gatti has commented that the opera itself illustrates Busoni's own particular ideas about opera as not depicting \"realistic events,\" and also making use of music not continuously, but instead when it is needed and words are insufficient alone to convey the ideas of the text. Larry Sitsky describes the music as \"tightly integrated\" and \"largely based on the 'row' [of tones] which appears as a fanfare at the commencement of the opera.\" And Henry Cowell has characterised this composition as \"the only opera to betray knowledge of Schoenberg 's early style before",

      "text": "Arlecchino , oder Die Fenster ( Harlequin, or The Windows , BV 270) is a one-act opera with spoken dialogue by Ferruccio Busoni , with a libretto in German , composed in 1913. He completed the music for the opera while living in Zurich in 1916. It is a number opera written in neo-classical style and includes ironic allusions to operatic conventions and situations typical of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It even includes a parody of a duel . Performance history The premiere performance was on 11 May 1917 at the Stadttheater, Zürich . Busoni's two-act opera Turandot was also performed on the program as part of a double-bill. The first British staged performance of Arlecchino was in 1954 at Glyndebourne . However, Edward Clark had produced a concert version in London in 1939, using an English translation by Edward Dent . It was conducted by Hyam Greenbaum on 12 February 1939 and televised by the BBC. Background The opera is in four movements with a corresponding representation of Arlecchino in each of them: I. ARLECCHINO als Schalk [Arlecchino as Rogue] (Allegro molto) II.

Second movement: Arlecchino as Warrior. 4. March and Scene. In the company of two constables ( Italian : sbirros ) Arlecchino returns in military attire and informs Matteo he has been called up and has three minutes in which to get his house in order. While away Arlecchino has made a copy of the key, and surreptitiously returns the original. The dumbfounded tailor appears in a ridiculous improvised uniform, requests and receives permission to carry along his beloved Dante, and sadly goes off, accompanied by the two constables. [This bit evokes a sad event in Italian history. In 1499 the French captured Milan and imprisoned the leader of the city, Ludovico Sforza (who was also a close friend of Leonardo da Vinci ). He was allowed one book: Dante's La divina Commedia . ] Third movement: Arlecchino as Husband. 5a. Scene and Aria . To Arlecchino's consternation, his wife Colombina appears just as he is trying to use his new key to open up Matteo's house. Not recognizing him initially, she asks the presumed Captain to protect her as an abandoned wife. As he turns round to face her, she suddenly realizes that the \"Captain\"",
