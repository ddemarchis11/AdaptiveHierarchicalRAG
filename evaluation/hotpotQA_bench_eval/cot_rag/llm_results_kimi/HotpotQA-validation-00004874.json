The group subsequently became known as the Bolton Whitman Fellowship or the \"Whitmanites\". Its founder members were Dr. John Johnston, Fred Wild, and Wallace. The group held an annual 'Whitman Day' celebration around the May 31st, the poet's birthday. Wallace and Johnston corresponded with Whitman, and Johnston visited Whitman at his home in Camden, New Jersey . Wallace visited Whitman in 1891. This visit was the subject of a play by Stephen M Hornby called \"The Adhesion of Love\" which toured the North West in 2019, including to Bolton Museum and the Bolton Socialist Club, whose members run the annual 'Whitman Day'. It was the national LGBT History Month heritage premiere for 2019. The play speculates that the men in the group were experimenting with different forms of emotional and sexual intimacy with each other and that this was a significant factor in the success of the group and its interest in Walt Whitman. Wallace moved to Adlington in the early 1890s and invited Charles Sixsmith to join the group which continued until the death of Wallace in 1926, and in a more modest form after that. After Wallace moved to Adlington in the early",

Huxley recounted that he once overheard a conversation about the club between two men of the Athenaeum Club, and when one asked what the X-Club did, the other explained \"Well they govern scientific affairs, and really, on the whole, they don't do it badly.\" Informal notes of early meetings seem to confirm some of the concerns. Discussion often surrounded the nomination of members to offices of major societies, as well as the negotiation of pension and medal claims. In 1876, the club even voted to collectively support Lubbock's candidacy for the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Huxley, however, always stated that the simple purpose of the club was to bring friends together who may have drifted apart otherwise. According to Huxley, the fact that all the members of the club gained distinction within science was merely coincidental.

In 1883, Spottiswoode died of typhoid and at the same time, according to Spencer, only two of the remaining eight members of the X club were in good health. Attendance at meetings began to dwindle and by 1885, Frankland and Lubbock",

The members of what would become the X Club sided with the Ethnological Society of London , which denounced slavery and embraced academic liberalism. The men of the X Club, especially Lubbock, Huxley, and Busk, felt that dissension and the \"jealousies of theological sects\" within learned societies were damaging, and they attempted to limit the contributions the Anthropological Society made to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, a society of which they were all members. Thus, by 1864, the members of the X Club were joined in a fight, both public and private, to unite the London scientific community with the objective of furthering the ideas of academic liberalism. Dining clubs Dining clubs, common in late-Victorian England, were characterised by informal gatherings where men with similar interests could share new ideas and information among friends. Many formal societies and institutions that existed in England during the 19th century started as informal dining clubs. The problem with most formal societies at the time, especially to those men that would come together to form the X Club, was the manner in which meetings were conducted; most were too large and unsuitable for the discussion of private scientific matters. In addition, due to the outbreak of debates over evolution and religion within the scientific societies of London during the",

It was organized by Mikhail Petrashevsky , a follower of the French utopian socialist Charles Fourier . Among the members were writers, teachers, students, minor government officials and army officers. While differing in political views, most of them were opponents of the tsarist autocracy and Russian serfdom . Like that of the Lyubomudry group founded earlier in the century, the purpose of the circle was to discuss Western philosophy and literature that was officially banned by the Imperial government of Tsar Nicholas I . Among those connected to the circle were the writers Dostoevsky and Saltykov-Shchedrin , and the poets Aleksey Pleshcheyev , Apollon Maikov , and Taras Shevchenko . Nicholas I, alarmed at the prospect of the revolutions of 1848 spreading to Russia, saw great danger in organisations like the Petrashevsky Circle. In 1849, members of the Circle were arrested and imprisoned. A large group of prisoners, Dostoevsky among them, were sent to Semyonov Place for execution. As they stood in the square waiting to be shot, a messenger interrupted the proceedings with notice of a reprieve. As part of a pre-planned intentional deception, the Tsar had prepared a letter to general-adjutant",
