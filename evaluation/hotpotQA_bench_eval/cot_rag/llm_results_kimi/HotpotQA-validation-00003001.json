Originally playing heavier nu metal and funk metal style music, the band achieved mainstream popularity in 1997 with their more pop -influenced single \" Fly \". The song's success led the band to shift its style dramatically to the more radio-friendly pop sound with their subsequent releases. Their best-selling album, 14:59 , was released in 1999, and featured popular singles \" Every Morning \", \" Someday \", followed by a self-titled album in 2001 featuring the single \" When It's Over \". The band would release two further albums, In the Pursuit of Leisure (2003) and Music for Cougars (2009), though the albums and respective singles generally sold far less.

The band's debut album, Lemonade and Brownies , was released in 1995 and though it failed to produce a major hit single it did earn them recognition in alternative circles. Floored (1997–1998) Sugar Ray's first mainstream hit came in the summer of 1997 with their song \" Fly \", which was released from the album Floored and featured reggae musician Super Cat . \"Fly\" did not sound anything at all like the rest of the tracks on the album and received frequent radio play, resulting in a number one rank on the Billboard's Airplay List. As a result of the success of \"Fly\", Floored sold well and was certified double platinum .
