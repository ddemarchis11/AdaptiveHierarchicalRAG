      "text": "Woolworth Building, 2004 The Woolworth Building is a historic building in Watertown, New York . It is a contributing building in the Public Square Historic District . Plans for the Woolworth Building were begun in 1916 by Frank W. Woolworth , the founder of the Woolworth's chain of department stores. Entrance marker History Woolworth began his retail career at the Smith and Moore Dry Goods Store in Watertown in 1873. It was during his time here that he was given the idea of selling fixed price merchandise, which led him to create his successful chain of five and dime department stores in 1879. The Smith and Moore store later became a member of the Woolworth chain. In 1916, Woolworth purchased the American Building in Watertown, which housed the store in which he began his career. Woolworth planned to demolish this structure, and build a grander building in its place. Woolworth's death in 1919 initially halted these plans, but the Woolworth Corporation eventually decided to go ahead with his plans, and the new six story Woolworth Building opened its doors in 1921. Woolworth's Department Store occupied the building until 1971, when the store was moved into a modern facility. Many shops occupied the bottom floor of the building in the ensuing years, while the upper five floors remained occupied by various business offices.

Using the sign from the Utica store, Woolworth opened his first successful \"Woolworth's Great Five Cent Store\" on June 21, 1879, in Lancaster. He brought his brother, Charles Sumner Woolworth , into the business. The two Woolworth brothers pioneered and developed merchandising , direct purchasing, sales, and customer service practices commonly used today. Despite its growing to be one of the largest retail chains in the world through most of the 20th century, increased competition led to its decline beginning in the 1980s apart from the company's growing sporting goods division. The chain went out of business in July 1997, when the company decided to focus primarily on sporting goods and renamed itself Venator Group . By 2001, the company focused",

The Woolworth's concept was widely imitated, and five-and-ten-cent stores (also known as five-and-dime stores or dimestores) became a 20th-century fixture in American downtowns. They would serve as anchors for suburban shopping plazas and shopping malls in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Criticisms that five-and-dime stores drove local merchants out of business would repeat themselves in the early 21st century, when big-box discount stores became popular.

They used the mayor's house or place of business for his office and council meetings. After it was completed, this building served as a jail into the late 1930s and as the city hall until 1952, when a new community building was completed. For most of the time it served as a jail it was outfitted with bars and had bunks. It was a short-term lock-up for those who committed minor infractions. It was used for a public library beginning in the 1940s. After its use as a city hall, it was bought by a local merchant for use in his grocery store in 1957.

It is located east of the central business district where warehouses and other industrial buildings are located. It housed the Sioux City Linseed Oil Works (initially known as Hubbard and Gere) from 1884, when it was built, until 1927 when its owner, the American Linseed Oil Company, ceased production here. The building was largely destroyed in a fire that began late in the night of May 20, 1891. Mankato, Minnesota architect William D. McLaughlin stepped in to complete the work begun by Sioux City architect E.W. Loft. The building was rebuilt and was very similar in appearance to the original structure. The gable roof on the westernmost wing was replaced by a flat roof, and two floors were added to the rebuilt press room annex in the back. The building was acquired by Bekins Van and Storage Company in 1928. They began operations here two years later and remained the primary tenant in the building until 1972. There was a variety of other tenants who were housed here over the years. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. References v t e v t e",
