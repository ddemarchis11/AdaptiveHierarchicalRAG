First lady in Manhattan Melania Trump with Donald Trump at the Liberty Ball, January 20, 2017 After Donald's inauguration as president on January 20, 2017, Melania announced that she would not move to Washington, D.C. , with him, instead staying in Manhattan so Barron could finish the school year there. Remaining in New York also allowed her to introduce her son to the White House gradually so as not to overwhelm him. According to biographer Mary Jordan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post journalist, \"Melania also used this time to negotiate new terms for her prenuptial agreement with Donald to reflect the changes in their lives since it was signed and to ensure that Barron would receive a suitable inheritance.\" (Mrs. Trump's spokesperson dismissed Jordan's book as \"belonging in the fiction genre\".) Melania's absence from the White House caused speculation that her stepdaughter Ivanka would serve",

She has served as First Lady of the United States since January 2025, a role she previously held from January 2017 to January 2021. Trump is the first naturalized citizen and the first non-native English speaker to become first lady; the second foreign-born first lady, after Louisa Adams ; the second Roman Catholic first lady, after Jacqueline Kennedy ; and the second to hold the position nonconsecutively, after Frances Cleveland . Melanija Knavs was born in Yugoslavia , where she began working as a fashion model at the age of 16 while pursuing her education. She changed the spelling of her name to Melania Knauss and traveled to Paris and Milan to seek modeling work before meeting Paolo Zampolli , who hired her and sponsored her immigration to the United States in 1996. She worked as a model in Manhattan , where she began dating Donald Trump shortly after Zampolli introduced them in 1998. Trump worked to get Knauss more modeling jobs, and she supported him during his 2000 presidential campaign . They married in 2005, and the following year had a son, Barron Trump . Knauss started her own jewelry brand, Melania , in 2009. After encouraging her husband to run for president",

      "text": "documentary in a decade. Public image A 2017 Women's March protester with a Free Melania sign Melania limits her interactions with the public, creating a public image heavily influenced by speculation. Because Louisa Adams , the only other first lady to be born outside of the United States, had an American father, Trump has been seen by the American public as the first foreigner to become first lady. First tenure as first lady In her first tenure as first lady, Trump worked to protect her privacy as first lady, and her staff was instructed not to answer any questions about her whereabouts at a given time. With limited information, commentators have portrayed her as being a reluctant companion to her husband or as a woman who has no independence of her own. Several incidents during her husband's presidency led to rumors that she had a secret animosity toward her husband, such as her delay in moving to the White House and allegations that he had committed adultery. The rumors led to popular use of the hashtag #FreeMelania by those who believed them. Though she disliked the idea that people saw her as helpless, Melania found the campaign amusing. This became less common by 2020 as she had become more publicly associated with the role of first lady. She is often seen as cold by the public, though people who interact with her describe her as a warm presence. As with previous first ladies, Trump's fashion was heavily scrutinized, and particularly expensive pieces were criticized. More than other first ladies, her fashion was",

      "text": "The Adamses lived in England for two years before returning to the United States when John was appointed Secretary of State . Louisa became a prominent cabinet wife and regularly hosted important guests in her home. She worked to build connections for her husband's 1824 presidential run , allowing for his victory. She was unsatisfied in the White House , where she became reclusive and grew distant from her husband. She instead took to writing, producing plays, essays, poems, and an autobiography. She wished for retirement after her husband lost re-election, but he was elected to the United States House of Representatives . She took a more active interest in politics, supporting abolitionism and greater rights for women in society. She was widowed in 1848, and she had a stroke in 1849 that left her with limited mobility. She died on May 15, 1852, at the age of 77, and Congress adjourned for her funeral, the second time a woman was honored in this way. She was the only foreign-born first lady of the United States until 2017, when Melania Trump became first lady. Her tenure as first lady is not as well studied as other parts of her life, due to her reclusiveness and the limited records she kept at the time. Still, she is generally rated in the upper half of first ladies by historians. Early life (1775–1788) Louisa Catherine Johnson was born in London on February 12,",
