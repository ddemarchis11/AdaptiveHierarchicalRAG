      "text": "Caesium-137 ( 137 55 Cs ), cesium-137 (US), or radiocaesium , is a radioactive isotope of caesium that is formed as one of the more common fission products by the nuclear fission of uranium-235 and other fissionable isotopes in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons . Trace quantities also originate from spontaneous fission of uranium-238 . It is among the most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products. Caesium has a relatively low boiling point of 671 °C (1,240 °F) and easily becomes volatile when released suddenly at high temperature, as in the case of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and with nuclear explosions , and can travel very long distances in the air. After being deposited onto the soil as radioactive fallout , it moves and spreads easily in the environment because of the high water solubility of caesium 's most common chemical compounds , which are salts . Caesium-137 was discovered by Glenn T. Seaborg and Margaret Melhase . Decay 137 Cs decay scheme showing half-lives , daughter nuclides , and types and proportion of radiation emitted. 137 Cs gamma spectrum. The characteristic 662 keV peak does not originate directly from 137 Cs , but from the decay of 137m Ba to its stable state. Caesium-137 has a half-life of about 30.04 years, decaying by beta emission to stable barium-137 .",

Caesium-137 is produced from the nuclear fission of plutonium and uranium ,‍ and by observing the characteristic gamma rays emitted by this isotope, one can determine whether the contents of a given sealed container were made before or after the first atomic bomb explosion ( Trinity test , 16 July 1945), which spread some of it into the atmosphere, quickly distributing trace amounts of it around the globe. This procedure has been used by researchers to check the authenticity of certain rare wines, most notably the purported \" Jefferson bottles \".‍ Surface soils and sediments are also dated by measuring the activity of 137 Cs . Nuclear bomb fallout Bombs in the Arctic area of Novaja Zemlja and bombs detonated in or near the stratosphere released caesium-137 that landed in upper Lapland , Finland. Measurements of caesium-137 in the region in the 1960s were reportedly 45,000 becquerels . Figures from 2011 have a midrange of about 1,100 becquerels, but no increase in cancer cases has been identified.‍ ‍ ‍ Chernobyl disaster As of today and for the next few hundred years or so, caesium-137 and strontium-90 continue to be the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , and pose the greatest risk to health, owing to their approximately 30-year half-life",

Due to the residual radioactivity and legal hurdles, the resulting material is not commonly recovered even from \"spent\" radioactive sources, meaning in essence that the entire mass is \"lost\" for non-radioactive uses. As an almost purely synthetic isotope not existing in the environment before 1945, caesium-137 has been used to date wine and detect counterfeits‍ and as a relative-dating material for assessing the age of sedimentation occurring after 1945.‍ Caesium-137 is also used as a radioactive tracer in geologic research to measure soil erosion and deposition; its affinity for fine sediments is useful in this application.‍ Health risks The biological behaviour of caesium is similar to that of potassium ‍ and rubidium . After entering the body, caesium gets more or less uniformly distributed throughout the body, with the highest concentrations in soft tissue .‍ However, unlike group 2 radionuclides like radium and strontium-90 , caesium does not bioaccumulate and is excreted relatively quickly.

Barium-137m has a half-life of about 153 seconds, its dropping to the ground state usually (85.1% of all 137 Cs decays) emitting photons having energy 0.6617 MeV .
