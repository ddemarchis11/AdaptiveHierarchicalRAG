St Vincents Hall is a Gothic Revival mansion in Grantham , Lincolnshire , England. It is a Grade II listed building . History The house was designed in the Gothic Revival style and built for the industrialist Richard Hornsby , who founded Richard Hornsby & Sons , an engine and machinery manufacturer, in 1868. The Hornsby family sold the property to the Paravicini family before the building was sold to the Air Ministry .

In December 1943 the building became headquarters for the USAAF 's Ninth Air Force 's IX Troop Carrier Command . After the war the house was retained by the Air Ministry and in 1960 became the headquarters of the Air Ministry Works Directorate No 1 Area, housing civil, mechanical and electrical engineers and surveyors. In 1962, the property agencies of the Air Ministry, Admiralty and War Office were amalgamated into the Ministry of Public Building and Works. Two years later, the Ministry was reorganised and St Vincents became surplus to requirements. It was eventually purchased by South Kesteven District Council and became home to the local planning authority. St Vincents is now privately owned.

Swanson would later star in many television and film productions including the smash hit Sunset Boulevard . Despite booming success under Charlie Chaplin, Essanay Studios soon faced a downturn. Chaplin did not like Chicago due to unpredictable weather conditions. After only one month of work, Chaplin left Chicago to head west. Spoor and Anderson soon hired French comedian, Max Linder , to take the role of Chaplin. Linder's wry humor was not appreciated by the Chicago audiences. The company suffered economically due to the inability to produce a popular film. In 1918 George Kleine purchased the studio to form a merger between Vitagraph, Lubin, Selig, and Essanay known as V-L-S-E, Incorporated which would eventually be absorbed by Warner Brothers . The Essanay location would eventually be taken over by industrial film producer, Norman Wilding. Currently, the remnants of the studio are part of St. Augustine's College which built a Charlie Chaplin memorial theater on site.
