In 3D printing PETG has become a popular material - used for high-end applications like surgical fracture tables to automotive and aeronautical sectors, among other industrial applications.

      "text": "Polyethylene terephthalate (or poly(ethylene terephthalate) , PET , PETE , or the obsolete PETP or PET-P ) is the most common thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in fibres for clothing, containers for liquids and foods, and thermoforming for manufacturing, and in combination with glass fibre for engineering resins . In 2020, annual global production of PET was 82 million tons. In the context of textile applications, PET is referred to by its common name, polyester , whereas the acronym PET is generally used in relation to packaging. PET used in non-fiber applications (i.e. for packaging) makes up about 6% of world polymer production by mass. Accounting for the >60% fraction of polyethylene terephthalate produced for use as polyester fibers, PET is the fourth-most-produced polymer after polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PET consists of repeating (C 10 H 8 O 4 ) units. PET is commonly recycled , and has the digit 1 (♳) as its resin identification code (RIC). The National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR) defines PET as: \"Polyethylene terephthalate items referenced are derived from terephthalic acid (or dimethyl terephthalate ) and mono ethylene glycol , wherein the sum of",

      "text": "Krones AG is a German packaging and bottling machine manufacturer. It produces lines for filling beverages in plastic and glass bottles or beverage cans. The company manufactures stretch blow-moulding machines for producing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, plus fillers, labellers, bottle washers, pasteurisers, inspectors, packers and palletisers . This product portfolio is complemented by material flow systems and process technology for producing beverages for breweries, dairies and soft-drink companies. History Krones' corporate evolution is closely connected to the socioeconomic conditions prevalent in Germany following World War II. Hermann Kronseder, the father of the present-day chairman of the supervisory board, used his own designs to manufacture semi-automatic labellers starting with 1951. In the further development as from the 1960s, the firm's range of machinery was extended to include packers and filling systems. In 1980, the company was converted into a stock corporation as Krones AG. With acquisitions of other companies the present-day range of machines for the beverage industry was reached: 1983: Anton Steinecker Maschinenfabrik (brewhouse manufacture), Freising , Germany 1988: Zierk Maschinenbau GmbH (bottle washers), Flensburg , Germany 1998: Max Kettner GmbH (packaging machines), Rosenheim , Germany 2000: Sander Hansen A/S (pasteurising systems),",

      "text": "important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, diethylene glycol (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via stretch blow molding (\"SBM\"), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages. Production Polyethylene terephthalate is produced largely from purified terephthalic acid (PTA), as well as to a lesser extent from (mono-)ethylene glycol (MEG) and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT). As of 2022, ethylene glycol is made from ethene found in natural gas , while terephthalic acid comes from p-xylene made from crude oil . Typically an antimony or titanium compound is used as a catalyst, a phosphite is added as a stabilizer and a bluing agent such as cobalt salt is added to mask any yellowing. Processes Dimethyl terephthalate process Polyesterification reaction in the production of PET In the dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) process, DMT and excess ethylene glycol (MEG) are transesterified in the melt at 150–200 °C with a basic",

      "text": "high value of the resin and the almost exclusive use of PET for widely used water and carbonated soft drink bottling. PET bottles lend themselves well to recycling (see below). In many countries PET bottles are recycled to a substantial degree, for example about 75% in Switzerland. The term rPET is commonly used to describe the recycled material, though it is also referred to as R-PET or post-consumer PET (POSTC-PET). The prime uses for recycled PET are polyester fiber, strapping, and non-food containers.  Because of the recyclability of PET and the relative abundance of post-consumer waste in the form of bottles, PET is also rapidly gaining market share as a carpet fiber. PET, like many plastics, is also an excellent candidate for thermal disposal ( incineration ), as it is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with only trace amounts of catalyst elements (but no sulfur).  In general, PET can either be chemically recycled into its original raw materials (PTA, DMT, and EG), destroying the polymer structure completely;  mechanically recycled into a different form, without destroying the polymer;  or recycled in a process that includes transesterification and the addition of other glycols, polyols, or glycerol to form a new polyol. The polyol from the third method can be used in polyurethane (PU foam) production, or epoxy-based products, including paints. In 2023 a process was",
