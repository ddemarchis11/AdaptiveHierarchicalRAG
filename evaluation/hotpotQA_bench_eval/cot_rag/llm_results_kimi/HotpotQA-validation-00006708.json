In June 2016, Harris released her second mixtape, S.T.D (Shelters to Deltas) . It was preceded by the single \" Best Dick Sucker \". Other tracks, such as \"Doggy Style\" and \"Motherlands\", were also later released as singles. The mixtape was listed among Rolling Stone 's \"Best Rap Albums of 2016 So Far\".

Other tracks on the album such as \"Spider-Man Dick\" and \"LGBT\" were accompanied by music videos.

      "text": "Vibe is an American music and entertainment magazine founded by producers David Salzman and Quincy Jones . The publication predominantly features R&B and hip hop music artists, actors and other entertainers. After shutting down production in the summer of 2009, it was purchased by the private equity investment fund InterMedia Partners , then issued bi-monthly with double covers and a larger online presence. The magazine's target demographic is predominantly young, urban followers of hip hop culture. In 2014, the magazine discontinued its print version. The magazine features a broader range of interests than its closest competitors The Source and XXL , which focus more narrowly on rap music, or the rock- and pop-centric Rolling Stone and Spin . The May 1998 Vibe article \"Racer X\" by Ken Li is credited as the basis for the 2001 film The Fast and the Furious and the resulting franchise . Publication history Quincy Jones launched Vibe in 1993, in partnership with Time Inc. Originally, the publication was called Volume before co-founding editor, Scott Poulson-Bryant named it Vibe . Vibe was initially \"founded with a test issue in 1992 by Time Warner.\"  Though hip hop mogul Russell Simmons was rumored to be an initial partner, publisher Len Burnett revealed in a March 2007 interview that Simmons clashed with editor-in-chief Jonathan Van Meter. In May 1994, Meter resigned after Jones prevented the publication of the June/July 1994 issue",

Career 2012–2016: Early output, Cum Cake , S.T.D (Shelters to Deltas) , and Audacious Harris released her first music video, \"Money\" onto her official YouTube channel in August 2012. She was only 15 at the time of its release—the original video has since been deleted. Over the next few years, she continued to release original music, as well as freestyles using beats from other artists through her YouTube channel, where she has amassed over 1.2 million subscribers. In October 2015, the official music video for her song \"Vagina\" was released on YouTube via YMCFilmz. According to Cupcakke, she wrote the song because she was inspired by Khia 's dirty rap song \" My Neck, My Back (Lick It) \" from 2002. One month later, Harris released \"Deepthroat\" on her own channel. Within weeks, the two videos went viral on YouTube, Worldstar, and Facebook . The songs later became singles for Harris' debut mixtape, Cum Cake , which was released in February 2016. Its release was also supported by further singles such as \"Juicy Coochie\", \"Tit for Tat\", and \"Pedophile\".

On March 7, English singer-songwriter Charli XCX premiered her song \"Lipgloss\", which featured Harris. The song was later included on XCX's mixtape, Number 1 Angel , which was released on March 10. Her second studio album, titled Queen Elizabitch , was released on March 31, 2017. The Fader described it as \"the type of nasty rap that made her a viral sensation, alongside all-out pop bangers like '33rd' and the confessional a cappella freestyle 'Reality, Pt. 4'.\" Stereogum also noted that the album \"sees CupcakKe engaging with the current political climate and radio trends in a way that could help her cross over to a more mainstream audience\". On April 7, 2017, Queen Elizabitch was removed from online streaming services and digital music stores due to an illegal backing track that Harris had purchased from what she described as a \"shady producer\". She soon announced on Twitter that Queen Elizabitch would be re-released on April 16. She then released the singles \" Exit \" and \" Cartoons \" in November 2017.",
