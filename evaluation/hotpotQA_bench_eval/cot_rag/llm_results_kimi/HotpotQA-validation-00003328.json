Each guest has four of the eight chefs assigned to them, and each guest presents two categories of food that he or she would like cooked. Examples of categories include Western-style food or a seafood dish that the guest's children would enjoy. Each of the four chefs chooses the category they wish to compete in,",

Before starting high school, his family moved to an apartment in Spring Lake, New Jersey . \"Nick\", as he was known to his high school friends, attended nearby Manasquan High School , where he was voted \"Class Clown\" by the Class of 1954. He was in detention every day for a whole school year. A theatre and a drama award at the school are named in his honor.
