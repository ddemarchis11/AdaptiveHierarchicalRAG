The website's consensus reads: \"Funny, self-referential, and irreverent to a fault, The Wolf of Wall Street finds Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio at their most infectiously dynamic.\" Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned the film a score of 75 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine named The Wolf of Wall Street as the third-best movie of 2013, behind 12 Years a Slave and Gravity . Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \"it is the best and most enjoyable American film to be released this year.\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker called the film \"Olympian\", saying that if it was Scorsese's last film it \"would rank among the most harshly awe-inspiring farewells of the cinema.\" The Chicago Sun-Times 's Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, calling it \"good, not great Scorsese\". Dana Stevens of Slate was more critical, calling the film \"epic in size, claustrophobically narrow in scope.\" Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post argued that the story \"wants us to be interested in characters who are dull people to start with, made duller by their delusions of being interesting because they are high\". Some critics viewed the film as an irresponsible glorification",
