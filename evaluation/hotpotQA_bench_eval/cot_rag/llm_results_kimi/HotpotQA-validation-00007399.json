      "text": "Copsi (or Copsig ; Old English : Cōpsige ; died 1067) was a Northumbrian magnate in late Anglo-Saxon England . He was a supporter of Tostig , and was exiled along with him in 1065. Copsi soon fled to Orkney (then a part of Norway ). The next year (1066), he joined Tostig at Sandwich , in Kent , with 17 ships. Copsi survived Tostig's defeat at Stamford Bridge , and when William the Conqueror prevailed at Hastings he travelled, in March 1067, to pay William homage at Barking (where William was staying while his tower was being constructed in London ). In return, William made Copsi Earl of Northumbria and sent him back to York . Copsi's rule lasted a mere five weeks, at which time he was murdered by Osulf , son of Eadulf IV of the ancient Bernician family which had historically governed the area from Bamburgh , at Newburn-upon-Tyne . Osulf led a small force which surprised Copsi during a banquet and forced him to flee to a nearby church, which was then set on fire. He was then captured and beheaded by Osulf. Osulf, however, only ruled as earl until that autumn, when he was killed by an outlaw he was tracking. Sources Stenton, Sir Frank M. Anglo-Saxon",

In the Middle Ages it became the northern England ecclesiastical province 's centre, and grew as a wool-trading centre. In the 19th century it became a major railway network hub and confectionery-manufacturing centre. In the Second World War York was bombed in the Baedeker Blitz . Although York was less targeted during the war than other, more industrialised northern cities, several historic buildings were gutted and restoration lasted until the 1960s. Historic local governance of the city was as a county",

Reclamation of parts of the town was initiated in the 7th century under King Edwin of Northumbria , and York became his chief city. The first wooden minster church was built in York for the baptism of Edwin in 627, according to the Venerable Bede. Edwin ordered the small wooden church be rebuilt in stone; however, he was killed in 633, and the task of completing the stone minster fell to his successor Oswald . In the following century, Alcuin of York came to the cathedral school of York. He had a long career as a teacher and scholar, first at the school at York now known as St Peter's School , founded in AD 627, and later as Charlemagne 's leading advisor on ecclesiastical and educational affairs. In 866 Northumbria was in the midst of internecine struggles when the Vikings raided and captured York. As a prosperous economic centre, York was a target for the Vikings. Led by Ivar the Boneless and Halfdan , Scandinavian forces (referred to by the Anglo-Saxons as the \" Great Heathen Army \") attacked the town on All Saints' Day. Launching the assault on a holy day proved an effective tactical move – most of York's leaders were in the cathedral, leaving the town vulnerable to attack and unprepared for battle. After it was",
