      "text": "Imperial War Museum North (sometimes referred to as IWM North ) is a museum in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester , England. One of five branches of the Imperial War Museum , it explores the impact of modern conflicts on people and society. It is the first branch of the Imperial War Museum to be located in the north of England. The museum occupies a site overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal on Trafford Wharf Road, Trafford Park , an area which during World War II was a key industrial centre and consequently heavily bombed during the Manchester Blitz in 1940. The area is now home to the Lowry cultural centre and the MediaCityUK development, which stand opposite the museum at Salford Quays . The museum building was designed by architect Daniel Libeskind and opened in July 2002, receiving 470,000 visitors in its first year of opening. It was recognised with awards or prize nominations for its architecture and is a prime example of Deconstructivist architecture. The museum features a permanent exhibition of chronological and thematic displays, supported by hourly audiovisual presentations which are projected throughout the gallery space. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions in a separate gallery. Since opening, the museum has operated a successful volunteer programme, which since January 2007 has been run in partnership with Manchester Museum . As part of a national museum, Imperial War Museum North is financed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and by self-generated income. Admission is free. Planning and construction",

      "text": "The Pittsburgh Light Rail (commonly known as The T or the Trolley ) is a 26.2-mile (42.2 km) light rail system in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania, and surrounding suburbs. It operates as a deep-level subway in Downtown Pittsburgh , but runs mostly at-grade in the suburbs south of the city. The system is largely linear in a north–south direction, with one terminus near Pittsburgh's central business district and two termini in the South Hills . The system is owned and operated by Pittsburgh Regional Transit . The T is one of the surviving first-generation streetcar systems in North America , with the oldest portions of the network dating back to 1903 and the Pittsburgh Railways . It is also one of only three light rail systems in the United States that continues to use the broad 5 ft 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1,588 mm ) Pennsylvania trolley gauge on its lines instead of the 4 ft 8 + 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1,435 mm ) standard gauge . In 2024, the system had a ridership of 3,236,100. History Overview In the early 1960s, Pittsburgh had the largest surviving streetcar system in the United States, with the privately owned Pittsburgh Railways Company operating more than 600 PCC cars on 41 routes. In 1964 the system was acquired by the Port Authority of Allegheny County , which rapidly converted most",

Proposed extensions Former Chief Executive of Allegheny County Dan Onorato hoped to eventually extend the light-rail system east to Oakland and west to Pittsburgh International Airport . In 2009, Onorato, along with Congressman Mike Doyle , requested approximately $7 million in funding from the federal government for preliminary planning of the extension. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette took a strong editorial stance in late 2012 for a workable extension to the northern suburbs all the way to Cranberry .

Large-scale abandonments of lines began in the late 1950s, usually associated with highway or bridge work. 1960s and Skybus 1970s In the 1960s a 92-mile (148 km) automated guideway transit system was planned fanning out to the north, south, east, southeast and west, including connections to both the Pittsburgh International Airport and the Allegheny County Airport , Monroeville Mall and adjacent to Kennywood Amusement Park. The modern subway and light rail system can be traced to the abandonment of the proposed \"Skybus\" system in the mid-1970s, and the subsequent $265 million federal grant on May 7, 1979, for construction of a downtown subway and modernization of suburban light rail.  Modern system Train of CAF LRV rolling stock crossing the Monongahela River on the Panhandle Bridge Downtown subway and Beechview Line (Stage I) PRT, working with community representatives and government officials, undertook a detailed study on the future of the South Hills trolley lines, resolving to transform these valuable, high-density transit corridors into a modern LRT system. The resulting Stage I LRT plan achieved a comprehensive reconstruction and upgrading of the 10.5-mile (16.9 km)",

In the Boston area, trackage is owned by a mixture of the MBTA and several freight railroads. Commuter rail services are operated by the Keolis Commuter Services (KCS) under contract to the MBTA, intercity passenger services are operated by Amtrak , and freight services are operated by the various freight railroads. Trackage rights allow trains of one operator to make use of tracks owned by another. Commuter rail Commuter Rail train at Wellesley Hills The MBTA commuter rail system brings people from as far away as Worcester and Providence (Rhode Island) into Boston. There are approximately 125,000 one-way trips on the commuter rail each day, making it the fifth-busiest commuter rail system in the country, outranked only by the various systems serving New York and Chicago suburbs. There are two major rail terminals in Boston: North Station and South Station . Commuter rail lines from the North Shore and northwestern suburbs begin and terminate at North Station; lines from the South Shore and the west start and end at South Station. There is no direct rail connection between North Station and South Station, so that interchange between the two stations generally requires the use of two different subway lines (Red/Orange or Red/Green).",
