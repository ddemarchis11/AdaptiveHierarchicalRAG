      "text": "Orfeo ed Euridice ( Italian: [orˈfɛːo ed euriˈdiːtʃe] ; French : Orphée et Eurydice ; English: Orpheus and Eurydice ) is an opera composed by Christoph Willibald Gluck , based on the myth of Orpheus and set to a libretto by Ranieri de' Calzabigi . It belongs to the genre of the azione teatrale , meaning an opera on a mythological subject with choruses and dancing. The piece was first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 5 October 1762, in the presence of Empress Maria Theresa . Orfeo ed Euridice is the first of Gluck's \"reform\" operas, in which he attempted to replace the abstruse plots and overly complex music of opera seria with a \"noble simplicity\" in both the music and the drama. The opera is the most popular of Gluck's works, and was one of the most influential on subsequent German operas . Variations on its plot—the underground rescue mission in which the hero must control, or conceal, his emotions—can be found in Mozart 's The Magic Flute , Beethoven 's Fidelio , and Wagner 's Das Rheingold .

It is the third of Gluck's so-called reform operas for Vienna, following Orfeo ed Euridice and Alceste , and the least often performed of the three. Like its predecessors, the libretto was written by Ranieri de' Calzabigi . The opera tells the story of the events between the Judgment of Paris and the flight of Paris and Helen to Troy . It was premiered at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 3 November 1770. Roles Synopsis The hero Paris is in Sparta , having chosen Aphrodite above Hera and Athena , sacrificing to Aphrodite and seeking, with the encouragement of Erasto, the love of Helen . Paris and Helen meet at her royal palace and each is struck by the other's beauty. She calls on him to judge an athletic contest and when asked to sing he does so in praise of her beauty, admitting the purpose of his visit is to win her love. She dismisses him. In despair Paris pleads with her, and she begins to give way. Eventually, through the intervention of Erasto, who reveals himself as Cupid , she gives way, but Pallas Athene (Athena) warns them of sorrow to come. In the final scene Paris and Helen make ready to",

      "text": "Romolo ed Ersilia is a three-act opera composed by Johann Adolph Hasse to an Italian-language libretto by Pietro Metastasio . The opera was commissioned by Empress Maria Theresa to celebrate the marriage of her son Leopold to Maria Luisa of Spain . The opera was first performed on 6 August 1765, the day after their wedding, in the court theatre of the Imperial Palace in Innsbruck . The opera received its first performance in modern times in 2011 during the Innsbruck Festival of Early Music . The opera is loosely based on The Rape of the Sabine Women , an episode in the legendary history of Rome , traditionally dated to 750 BC. The opera's main protagonists are Romolo ( Romulus , the founder and ruler of Rome) and Ersilia ( Hersilia , who became the wife of Romulus). The same libretto was set eight years later by Josef Mysliveček and again titled Romolo ed Ersilia . The libretto also formed the basis for a 1780 ballet d'action choreographed by Charles Le Picq to music by Martín y Soler and entitled Il ratto delle Sabine . An opera entitled Romolo ed Ersilia is the opera seria which is parodied as the \"opera within an opera\" in Donizetti 's Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali .

Orfeo sings of his grief in the famous aria \"Che farò senza Euridice?\"/\"J’ai perdu mon Eurydice\" (\"What shall I do without Euridice?\"/\"I have lost my Euridice\") Orfeo decides he will kill himself to join Euridice in Hades, but Amore returns to stop him (1774 only: Trio: \"Tendre Amour\"). In reward for Orfeo's continued love, Amore returns Euridice to life, and she and Orfeo are reunited. After a four-movement ballet, all sing in praise of Amore (\"Trionfi Amore\"). In the 1774 version, the chorus (\"L’Amour triomphe\") precedes the ballet, to which Gluck had added three extra movements.

      "text": "'s Das Rheingold . Though originally set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to the genre of French opera , particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence of vocal virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera to suit the tastes of a Parisian audience at the Académie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline . This reworking was given the title Orphée et Eurydice , and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes. Background Algarotti by Jean-Étienne Liotard in the Rijksmuseum Francesco Algarotti 's Essay on the Opera (1755) was a major influence in the development of Gluck's reformist ideology. Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of opera seria , with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music or ballet or staging. The drama itself should \"delight the eyes and ears, to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense\". Algarotti's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist, Calzabigi. Calzabigi was himself a prominent advocate of reform, and he stated, \"If Mr Gluck was the creator of dramatic music, he did not create it from",
