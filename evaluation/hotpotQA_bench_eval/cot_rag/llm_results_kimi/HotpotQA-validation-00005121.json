According to the original sleeve notes, all the songs have a \"common geographical root: the American South.\" In 1963, Capitol Records re-released Swingin' Down Yonder under the titled Southern Style . The 1991 Capitol Records CD reissue added eight bonus tracks which for the most part uphold the Dixieland sound. By contrast, the 2005 Collectors' Choice reissue selected four bonus tracks of dubious connection to the American South, including \"Under the Bridges of Paris\".

It is the first long-play 10-inch album recorded by Martin for Capitol Records during two sessions recorded on the evening of November 20, 1952. The first session was recorded between 5 and 8 PM and it produced five songs featuring string arrangements. \"There's My Lover\" was recorded but not released. After a 90-minute break, Martin was joined by a brass arrangement to record the remaining four songs. Seven of the eight songs on this album appeared in the Martin & Lewis film, The Stooge . Two years later, the songs from this 10-inch album would be combined with four newly popular songs recorded between 1951 and 1953 to create a full-length 12-inch album. The 2005 Collectors' Choice reissue added four bonus songs recorded between 1949 and 1953 and was released with alternative cover artwork.

Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Martin out on stage and as the two men embraced, the audience gave them a standing ovation and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon's most profitable years up to that time. Lewis later reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, \"So, you working?\" Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was appearing \"at the 'Meggum ' \" (meaning the MGM Grand Hotel). This, with the death of Martin's son Dean Paul Martin more than a decade later, helped bring the two men together. They maintained a quiet friendship, but only performed again once, on Martin's 72nd birthday in 1989. Martin returned to films briefly with appearances in the star-laden, critically panned but commercially successful The Cannonball Run and its sequel Cannonball Run II . He also had a minor hit single with \" Since I Met You Baby \" and made his first music video, which appeared on MTV and was created by Martin's youngest son, Ricci. On March 21, 1987, Martin's son, actor Dean Paul Martin (formerly Dino of the 1960s \" teeny-bopper \" rock group Dino, Desi & Billy ), died when his F-4 Phantom II jet fighter crashed while flying with the California Air National Guard .

Nicknamed the \" King of Cool \", he is regarded as one of the most popular entertainers of the 20th century. Martin gained his career breakthrough together with comedian Jerry Lewis , billed as Martin and Lewis , in 1946. They performed in nightclubs and later had numerous appearances on radio and television and in films. Following an acrimonious ending of the partnership in 1956, Martin pursued a solo career as a performer and actor. He established himself as a singer, recording numerous contemporary songs as well as standards from the Great American Songbook . Martin became one of the most popular acts in Las Vegas and was known for his friendship with fellow artists Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. , who together with several others formed the Rat Pack . Starting in 1965, Martin was the host of the television variety program The Dean Martin Show , which centered on Martin's singing and comedic talents and was characterized by his relaxed, easy-going demeanor. From 1974 to 1984, Martin was roastmaster on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast , a popular show that drew celebrities, comedians and politicians. Throughout his career, Martin performed on concert stages, in nightclubs and audio recordings and appeared in 85 film and television productions and sold 12 million records in the United States alone,",
