      "text": "Call Me by Your Name is a 2017 coming-of-age romantic drama film directed by Luca Guadagnino . Its screenplay, by James Ivory , who also co-produced, is based on the 2007 novel by André Aciman . The film is the final installment in Guadagnino's thematic \"Desire\" trilogy, after I Am Love (2009) and A Bigger Splash (2015). Set in northern Italy in 1983, Call Me by Your Name chronicles the romantic relationship between 17-year-old Elio Perlman ( Timothée Chalamet ) and Oliver ( Armie Hammer ), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father Samuel ( Michael Stuhlbarg ), an archaeology professor. The film also stars Amira Casar , Esther Garrel , and Victoire Du Bois . Development began in 2007 when producers Peter Spears and Howard Rosenman optioned the rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory was chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino joined the project as a location scout and eventually became sole director and co-producer. Call Me by Your Name was financed by several international companies, and its principal photography took place mainly in the city and comune of Crema, Lombardy , in May and June 2016. Cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom used 35 mm film , as opposed to employing digital",

In September 2016, Ivory confirmed they were no longer involved in the project. Ivory said he got along with LaBeouf, who had read for the film in New York City, but the production company later felt he was unsuitable after his \"various troubles\". Ivory thought Scacchi and LaBeouf read well together and could have made it into the film, but the company disagreed. Guadagnino was impressed by Armie Hammer 's performance in The Social Network (2010), calling him a \"sophisticated actor, with a great range\". Hammer almost turned down the role of Oliver after reading the draft script because it contained nudity, saying: \"There's a lot of stuff here that I've never done on film before.
