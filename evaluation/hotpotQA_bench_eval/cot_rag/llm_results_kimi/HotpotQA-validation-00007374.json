The book offers a formula for weight loss that health equals nutrients divided by calories. The diet is vegetarian, vegan, low-salt, low-fat, and gluten-free for the first six weeks, after which animal products may be added. The diet is considered \"extremely restrictive\" for its restrictions against snacks, sugar, and oils. Notes",

      "text": "has promoted a vitalistic view of food and the pseudoscientific idea of detoxification . Dietitian Carolyn Williams has described Fuhrman's Nutritarian diet as a fad diet . According to Williams \"This can be helpful for people who feel stuck in their weight loss journey and want to totally reset or detox their diet following a holiday or vacation. Although this diet is marketed as an eating pattern, it is essentially a fad diet. Those who do try this diet should go into it knowing that it is not sustainable for everyone long-term, and is only a temporary quick fix to lose weight.\" Harriet Hall , a founder of Science-Based Medicine , a website owned and operated by the New England Skeptical Society, reviewed Fuhrman's Nutritarian diet and commented that he tends to incorrectly assume association studies show causation and that his diet has not been tested in controlled trials. Hall stated that \"Fuhrman makes extraordinary claims for the Nutritarian diet, but extraordinary claims must be supported by extraordinary evidence, and the evidence he presents is far from compelling.\" Books Fasting and Eating for Health: A Medical Doctor's Program for Conquering Disease (1995) ISBN 978-0312187194 Eat to Live: The Amazing Nutrient-Rich Program for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss (2003) ISBN 978-0316120913 Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right (2006) ISBN",

VLCD is used for clinical purposes since at least the 1980s. In 1978, 58 people died in the United States after following very-low-calorie liquid protein diets. Following this event, the FDA requires since 1984 that protein VLCDs providing fewer than 400 calories a day carry a warning that they can cause serious illness and need to be followed under medical supervision. However, newer regulations require this warning only on protein products that aim to provide more than half of a person's calories and are promoted for weight loss or as a food supplement . This enabled protein VLCD drinks such as Slim-Fast that provide fewer than 400 calories to avoid warnings by recommending that users \"also eat one sensible meal each day\". In 1991, the Federal Trade Commission charged three liquid VLCD companies, Optifast, Medifast and Ultrafast, with deceptive advertising. The case was settled after the companies agreed to stop using what the FTC alleged to be deceptive claims about the long-term results and the safety of these diets.
