      "text": "The Livesey Hall War Memorial , in Lewisham , Greater London, commemorates the fallen of World War I and World War II who had been employed by the South Suburban Gas Company of London. It is also a tribute to those employees who served in the wars. The monument was designed and executed by the British sculptor Sydney March , of the March family of artists. Location Livesey Memorial Hall in 2011 The Livesey Hall War Memorial is located in the Sydenham area of Lewisham , Greater London, England. The locality is also referred to as Catford . It is positioned on Perry Hill, in the Bell Green neighbourhood, in front of Livesey Memorial Hall. Both structures take their name from the philanthropist Sir George Livesey (1834–1908), former chairman of the South Metropolitan Gas Company, as did the Livesey Museum for Children . Design The monument includes a bronze winged female figure with outstretched arms held aloft and wings spread horizontally. The triumphant Victory statue stands on a bronze globe encircled with serpents and set on a bronze wreathed base. This is all set on a semi-circular stone base to which a small bronze plaque was attached. Three steps lead to a backdrop of vertical limestone slabs on which three bronze plaques were affixed, two on the front and one on the back. The inscriptions on the left hand panel on the front and the smaller panel in the centre dedicated the memorial",

First World War memorial Background The Port of London Authority building at 10 Trinity Square is one of several nautical buildings in the area. In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain and other countries affected. In particular, the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) assumed responsibility for commemorating all casualties from the British Empire . The commission was established in 1917, and one of its first principal architects was Sir Edwin Lutyens , an English architect who made his reputation building country houses and later designed much of New Delhi . Lutyens acted as an unpaid advisor to the IWGC during the war, in which capacity he made several visits to France to make initial plans for organised cemeteries. The war had a profound effect on Lutyens; following it, he devoted much of his time to memorialising its casualties. He designed The Cenotaph on Whitehall in central London (which became Britain's national memorial to the two world wars) and many other cemeteries and memorials for the IWGC, including the Thiepval Memorial (completed 1932). The IWGC and its founder, Fabian Ware , were determined from the outset that all casualties should be individually and equally",

Sculptor The Livesey Hall War Memorial was designed and sculpted by the British artist Sydney March. The son of George and Elizabeth March, he was born in 1876 in Stoneferry , a suburb of Hull , East Riding of Yorkshire, England. He was the second of nine children, eight of whom became artists. As a child, Sydney March worked as a monumental sculptor's apprentice. Later, he attended the Royal Academy Schools , where he won first prize in 1900. March exhibited thirteen times at The Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts between 1906 and 1932. His family established studios at their home of Goddendene in Farnborough , Kent after 1901. Sydney March was a prolific artist whose primary focus was war memorials, as well as sculptures of British royalty and other contemporary figures. He and his siblings completed the National War Memorial of Canada after the 1930 death of their brother, sculptor Vernon March . Other monuments for which he is renowned include the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers South African War Memorial in Northern Ireland, the United Empire Loyalist Monument in Canada, and the Lancaster Monument in England. Smaller-scale pieces include the portrait busts of King Edward VII and Cecil John Rhodes , both in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Sydney March died in 1968 at the age of 92.

His ashes were interred in the family plot at St Giles the Abbot Churchyard in Farnborough. In 1922, Sydney had sculpted the bronze angel monument that marks the March plot. Theft of plaques In October 2011, the three bronze plaques from the front of the monument were stolen. Police in the Greater London area reported in late 2011 that incidents of metal theft began about 2006, and had increased since then. Thieves were not only stealing memorial plaques from monuments and cemeteries, but also other sources of metal such as roofs, manhole covers, and railway cable.
