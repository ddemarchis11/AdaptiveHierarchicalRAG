Drew did not warm to the song at first, but accepted an invitation to hear it live at the Roostertail, where Valli was performing a weeklong stint with the Four Seasons. Drew liked what he heard and added the song to his station's playlist. \"The switchboards lit up, and the rest, as they say, is history\", Gaudio recalled. Valli recalled in 2014 that \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" was the first step in the fulfillment of his goal to sing music that did not require him to use falsetto : \"I didn't want to sing like that my whole life. Once we established the sound, the plan was that eventually I would do solo [records] and some things I really wanted to do. I was very lucky to make the transition to 'My Eyes Adored You' and ' Swearin' to God ', which had none of that.\" Valli also recalled that the record had been mothballed by The Four Seasons' record company for a year because of their fear that The Four Seasons (who had already lost Nick Massi in 1965) were breaking up, to which Valli insisted that he had no intentions of ever leaving The Four Seasons. Credits The song was written by Bob Crewe and Bob Gaudio . Melodic elements bear a similarity to passages from the \"Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia\" section of",

The latter became a UK single but failed to chart, while the former was released as a single in America, inching its way into the Hot 100 and became a top-5 hit, the group's last, in South Africa . Valli had planned to add his daughter Francine to the act in 1980, but Francine unexpectedly died that year. The early 1980s saw the addition of keyboardist/music director Robby Robinson , who has remained a member of the Four Seasons for the rest of their history. In 1984, a long-awaited collaboration between the Four Seasons and the Beach Boys, \"East Meets West\", was released on FBI Records, owned by the Four Seasons Partnership, which included most of the surviving Beach Boys (including Brian Wilson). However, the record did not sell well. Even after the rise and fall of the band's sales in the disco era, the Four Seasons, in one version or another, continued to be a popular touring act. The touring contributed to roughly half of the group's income in the late 1980s, with the other half coming from royalties and Gaudio's songwriting and production work for other artists; under the terms of his original partnership with Valli, any songwriting revenue Gaudio earned would be split evenly with Valli. In August 1985, MCA Records released the band album Streetfighter , which yielded two singles in the title track and",

The band recruited Clay Jordan as their new keyboardist; Jordan was unable to handle the vocal strain of Gaudio's tenor parts, and touring keyboardist Bill DeLoach took his place. On March 25, 1973, with DeVito's debts finally paid off and following a concert in which DeLoach was unable to sing, Valli—in severe pain from ulcers and losing his hearing due to otosclerosis — angrily fired everyone in the band except Joe Long and briefly announced his intent to disband the Four Seasons.

Clockwise from top: Demetri Callas , Joe Long , Frankie Valli , Bob Gaudio . Valli was soon persuaded to return; Bob Crewe then convinced Nick Massi to return to the studio to help Valli and the band record eight tracks for a potential second MoWest album in late 1973 and 1974. These sessions were where Gaudio met his next songwriting partner and future wife, Judy Parker . Valli rehired Callas, hired 19-year-old Lee Shapiro as keyboardist and arranger, and Gerry Polci as drummer and eventual vocalist. The sessions produced the single",

In August 1985, MCA Records released the band album Streetfighter , which yielded two singles in the title track and \"Book of Love\", a post-disco -style revamp of the Monotones' 1957 recording. In September 1992, the band released an album entitled Hope + Glory on the MCA/Curb label; this is the most recent band studio album to date, but Valli has released three solo albums since then. On at least one or two occasions, starting in the late 1980s or early 1990s, former member Joe Long would make guest appearances with Valli and the band at select shows, but it is unclear if this included full performances or parts of concerts. Nick Massi also had occasional brief reunions with the group. In 1990, the original four members - Frankie Valli, Bob Gaudio, Tommy DeVito, and Nick Massi - appeared together for the first time in 25 years, at the Four Seasons' induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Valli had unsuccessfully fought to have Joe Long included in the induction.

The tour was abruptly halted on September 29, 2025, due to Valli suffering an illness, and most remaining tour dates were cancelled. Throughout the Four Seasons' 66-year existence, no incarnation of the group has ever won a competitive Grammy Award . In 2025, Valli was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award , the only Grammy the group has yet received.
