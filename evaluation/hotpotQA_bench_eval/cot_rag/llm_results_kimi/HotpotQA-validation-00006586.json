History Before colonization Boston Harbor was inhabited for thousands of years prior to European colonization of the Americas , with some of the earliest human remains in the Boston area found on Peddocks Island , dated to more than 4000 years before present.

Boston Harbor was recognized by Europeans as one of the finest natural harbors in the world due to its depth and natural defense from the Atlantic as a result of the many islands that dot the harbor. It was also favored due to its access to the Charles River , Neponset River , and Mystic River , which made travel from the harbor deeper into Massachusetts far easier. By 1660, almost",

Geography A section of the Boston Harborwalk U.S. Coast Guard escorts an LNG tanker in Boston Harbor in 2016 Boston Harbor is a large harbor, which constitutes the western extremity of Massachusetts Bay . The harbor is sheltered from Massachusetts Bay and the open Atlantic Ocean by a combination of the Winthrop Peninsula and Deer Island to the north, the hooked Nantasket Peninsula and Point Allerton to the south, and the harbor islands in the middle. The harbor is often described as being split into an inner harbor and an outer harbor. The harbor itself comprises 50 square miles (130 km 2 ) with 180 miles (290 km) of shoreline and 34 harbor islands. Inner Harbor The inner harbor was historically the main port of Boston and is still the site of most of its port facilities as well as the Boston waterfront, which has been redeveloped for residential and recreational uses. The inner harbor extends from the mouths of the Charles River and the Mystic River , both of which empty into the harbor, to Logan International Airport and Castle Island , the latter now connected by land in 1928 to Boston, where the inner harbor meets the outer harbor. Outer Harbor The outer harbor stretches to the south and east of the inner harbor. To its landward side, and moving in a counterclockwise direction, the harbor is made up of the three small bays of Dorchester Bay , Quincy Bay and Hingham Bay . To seaward, the",
