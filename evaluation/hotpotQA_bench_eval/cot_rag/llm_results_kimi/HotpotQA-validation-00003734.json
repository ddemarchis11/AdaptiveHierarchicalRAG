This prediction, however, failed to materialize when Soares won by a landslide. Soares' campaign received third-party support from the progressive, union-backed Working Families Party, which viewed Soares' victory as a sign of its own influence and of a mandate for reform of New York's Rockefeller drug sentencing laws (which were opposed by Soares, but supported by Clyne). Michael Slackman of The New York Times stated that the Party had \"established itself as an emerging political force statewide by getting a little-known candidate elected district attorney in Albany County.\" Soares' victory was called one of the \"most stunning upsets in New York political history.\" The New York Times noted the unusual nature of that upset the day that almost all incumbents won easy re-election. 2008 re-election campaign Former DA Clyne, who lost to current DA Soares by a landslide in the 2004 Democratic primaries, initially contemplated opposing his successor for re-election; but",

      "text": "Paul Clyne was the District Attorney of Albany County, New York from January 2001 through December 2004. A graduate of Albany Law School , he spent about 14 years as an assistant district attorney, before he was tapped by local politicians to replace the retiring District Attorney, Sol Greenberg . He was defeated for re-election by David Soares , first in the Democratic Party primary election in September 2004, and then in the general election in November 2004, in which he ran on an independent line. After a stint teaching at the New York Prosecutors Institute, he went into private practice as a criminal defense attorney in 2007, with an office in Albany, New York . Clyne is married and has two children, Maddie and John. His brother, Matthew J. Clyne, is an election commissioner for Albany County. In April 2008, Clyne said he was opposing his successor, David Soares, for re-election, and the Albany County Democratic candidate selection committee refused to endorse either candidate. He ended up not running after all; in November 2008, Soares won re-election, by a 73 to 27% margin against another candidate. In April 2010, Clyne joined Council 82, a labor union for law enforcement officers, as a full-time staff attorney. References External links NPR Interview of June 29, 2004",

Soares beat Kindlon handily in a primary that year, illustrating that Kindlon's argument did not negatively influence voters in the least. In addition, the Working Families Party circulated a petition supporting Soares' decision not to prosecute the Occupy protesters. Soares received criticism from one Albany County official for arguing back vacation pay to an assistant district attorney whom he had dismissed. Michael Conners, County Comptroller, noted his supposed hypocrisy , since Soares had received his past due pay when Clyne had fired him. Soares distinguished the two cases, because he fired the ADA for cause, while he had been fired for running against his boss. Awards and Public Recognition Soares has received several public service awards during his tenure as District Attorney, including being named a 2015 \"America's Top 10 Animal Defender\" by the Animal Legal Defense Fund , and the Whitney M. Young Community Partner of the Year Award in",

For a moment it looked as though Soares might run unopposed since no candidate from either major parties, Democratic or Republican, had filed to run for the office of District Attorney of Albany County before the deadline to file expired. However, since there was still time left for independent candidates to file, Roger Cusick, a Republican, who had opposed DA Soares in 2004 and lost, declared himself as an independent candidate on August 18, one day before the deadline to file as an independent candidate would have expired. Cusick was able to get enough signatures to put himself in the ballot list. He once again opposed DA Soares in the November 2008 election. In November 2008, Soares won re-election by a landslide, 73% to 27%, with a 50,000 vote margin. November 2008 election for district attorney P. David Soares (D), 80,441 votes, or 73% Roger J.
