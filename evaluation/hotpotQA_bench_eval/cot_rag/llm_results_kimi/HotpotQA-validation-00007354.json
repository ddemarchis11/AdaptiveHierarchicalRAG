      "text": "Hendersonville is a city in and the county seat of Henderson County, North Carolina , United States, located 22 miles (35 km) south of Asheville . Like the county, the city is named for 19th-century North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Leonard Henderson . As of the 2020 census , Hendersonville had a population of 15,137. Introduction Prior to the Treaty of Hopewell , the land that now is occupied by Hendersonville was settled by Cherokee tribes. Following this treaty, white settlers entered the region, eventually taking the land of what is now Henderson County in full from the original inhabitants. Poor trade links still restricted economic and demographic growth in the region, until the development of the Buncombe Turnpike , completed in 1827. Wealthy low-country planters started to migrate to the area, building summer homes and bringing lots of money with them. In response to this population growth, Henderson County was split off from Buncombe County and founded in 1838. Judge Mitchell King owned 1,000 acres (4.0 km 2 ), of which he donated 50 acres for the establishment of the town of Hendersonville. He used some of the enslaved African Americans he owned as workers to lay out its 100-foot-wide (30 m) Main Street. Formed in 1838 and chartered in 1847 as the county seat of Henderson County, Hendersonville is traditionally known as \"The City of Four Seasons\". The town",

The town has a well-preserved Main Street and adjoining downtown areas with many restaurants, antique shops and boutiques in buildings that housed key local businesses until the mid-1980s. At that point some businesses moved to suburban or highway locations, or were put out of business by big box competition. The town's architecture reflects the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Much downtown revitalization has occurred since the early 1990s. Larger stores have been developed almost entirely along the commercial strips extending outward from the downtown along U.S. Highway 64 east and U.S. Highways 176 and 25 . There are historic neighborhoods outside the Main Street corridor, including the 5th Avenue neighborhood on the city's west side and the Druid Hills neighborhood north of downtown. Depressed areas are found along the city's east side, but redevelopment efforts are underway in the historic commercial district along 7th Avenue East. The architectural focus of the downtown area is the historic Henderson County Courthouse , completed in 1905 and completely renovated in 2008. The newly restored City Hall (erected 1924) and the modern Henderson County Courthouse (1995) are also located downtown.
