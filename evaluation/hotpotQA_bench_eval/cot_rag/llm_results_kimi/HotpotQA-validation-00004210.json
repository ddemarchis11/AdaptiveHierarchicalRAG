      "text": "Don Quichotte ( Don Quixote ) is an opera in five acts by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Henri Caïn . It was first performed on 19 February 1910 at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo . Massenet's comédie héroïque , like many dramatized versions of the story of Don Quixote, relates only indirectly to the novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes . The immediate inspiration was Le chevalier de la longue figure , a play by the poet Jacques Le Lorrain [ fr ] first performed in Paris in 1904. In this version of the story, the simple farm girl Aldonza (Dulcinea) of the original novel becomes the more sophisticated Dulcinée, a flirtatious local beauty inspiring the infatuated old man's exploits. Composition history Conceiving originally Don Quichotte to be a three-act opera, Massenet started to compose it in 1909 at a time when, suffering from acute rheumatic pains, he spent more of his time in bed than out of it, and composition of Don Quichotte became, in his words, a sort of \"soothing balm\". In order to concentrate on that new work, he interrupted composition of another opera Bacchus . Despite its five acts, there is under two hours of music in the opera. Massenet identified personally with his comic-heroic",

      "text": "opera Bacchus . Despite its five acts, there is under two hours of music in the opera. Massenet identified personally with his comic-heroic protagonist, as he was in love with Lucy Arbell who sang Dulcinée at the first performance. He was then 67 and died just two years later. The role of Don Quichotte was one of the most notable achievements of the Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin , for whom the role was specifically conceived. The opera was one of six commissioned from Massenet by Raoul Gunsbourg for the Opéra de Monte-Carlo . Performance history Don Quichotte was premiered in Monte Carlo on 19 February 1910, followed by stagings in Brussels that May, and Marseille and Paris in December 1910. Its première at the Opéra-Comique in October 1924 was followed by over 60 performances during the succeeding quarter of a century; Arbell sang in the 1924 and 1931 runs, and Chaliapin appeared there in 1934, while the conductors included Maurice Frigara , Paul Bastide and Roger Désormière . In 1912 it was presented at the French Opera House in New Orleans (27 January), and the London Opera House (17 May). On 15 November 1913 the work was presented in Philadelphia. The Chicago premiere of the work (by the Chicago Grand Opera Company ) took place at the Auditorium Theatre on 27 January",

Other than full-length opera performance recordings, Domingo has also made many music albums, recording opera arias , live opera performances and concerts, and crossover songs in solo and duet. His albums have simultaneously appeared on Billboard charts of best-selling classical and crossover recordings; contributing to many gold and platinum records and nine Grammy Awards . Below are the lists of his recordings in full-length opera performances, music albums and compilation albums (including concerts) with other singers.

      "text": "Tosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa . It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou 's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca , is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples 's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon 's invasion of Italy . It contains depictions of torture, murder, and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias. Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias , recitative , choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas.",
