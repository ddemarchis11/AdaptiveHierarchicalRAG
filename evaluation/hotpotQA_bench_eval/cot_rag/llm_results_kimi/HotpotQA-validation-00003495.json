In Chalte Chalte , Aadesh Shrivastava composed several songs, while in Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya , one song was composed by Himesh Reshammiya and Sajid–Wajid .

Later, they also composed a song for Sanjay Dutt to sing in the film Khoobsurat . Jatin–Lalit has composed the highest-selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year on four occasions – Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge in 1995, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in 1998, Mohabbatein in 2000, and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham in 2001. The duo has been accused of plagiarism. Indian music critic Karthik Srinivasan , on his website ItwoFS , which tracks plagiarism in the Indian film music industry, lists 23 such tunes. Among those is Suno Zara from the movie Bada Din (1998) allegedly taken from Anne Murray ’s You Needed Me (1978). The separation and reunion After working for almost 16 years together, they announced that they would be parting ways due to personal problems. Reasons for the separation still are unknown.

      "text": "Musical career The creation of the pair Jatin–Lalit was by accident. In the early 80s, Jatin teamed up with Mandheer (elder brother) to team up as Jatin-Mandheer. This pair never had any big hits to their name. However, they earned the badge of working with legends - Kishore Kumar -Wafaa (1990) and Mohd Rafi - Dil Hi Dil Main (1982). Lalit, the youngest brother, was discovering his love for music. Since, the Jatin-Mandheer pair didn't really sizzle in the circuit, and Lalit was eager to make a mark as well, it was decided to revisit the music combination, and thus Jatin -Lalit - the duo, was formed. Their first foray as a pair was a private album Rhythmic Love. This album had quite a few songs, which were later recreated by the pair, in successful films like Yaara Dildaara, Yes Boss. They began their career in 1991, composing music for the Hindi movie Yaara Dildara . Although the film was a Romantic Film, its music was the biggest hit. The evergreen famous song of the movie was \"Bin Tere Sanam\", which topped the charts. They were first noticed for their work on the soundtrack of the movie Khiladi and for \"Pehla Nasha\", a romantic song from Jo Jeeta",
