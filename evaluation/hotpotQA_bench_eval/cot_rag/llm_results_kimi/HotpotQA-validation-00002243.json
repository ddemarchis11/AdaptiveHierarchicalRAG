MacDonald voiced Mickey in most of the remaining theatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in 1976. However, other actors would occasionally play the role during this era. Clarence Nash , the voice of Donald Duck, provided Mickey's voice in four theatrical shorts, Plutopia , R'coon Dawg , Pluto's Party , and Pluto's Christmas Tree . Stan Freberg voiced Mickey in the Freberg-produced record Mickey Mouse's Birthday Party . Alan Young voiced Mickey in the Disneyland record album An Adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players in 1974. The 1983 short film Mickey's Christmas Carol marked the theatrical debut of Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse, who was the official voice of Mickey from 1977 until his death in 2009, although MacDonald returned to voice Mickey for an appearance at the 50th Academy Awards in 1978. Allwine once recounted something MacDonald had told him about voicing Mickey: \"The main piece of advice that Jim gave me about Mickey helped me keep things in perspective. He said, 'Just remember kid, you're only filling in for the boss.' And that's the way he treated doing Mickey for years and years. From Walt, and now from Jimmy.\" In 1991, Allwine married Russi Taylor , the voice of",

Peter Renaday voiced Mickey in many 1970s and 1980s Disney records and albums, such as Yankee Doodle Mickey , Mickey Mouse Splashdance , and several Disney Read-Along titles. He also provided his voice for The Talking Mickey Mouse toy in 1986. Jack Wagner voiced Mickey and other Disney characters in the 1980s, primarily for live entertainment offerings in the parks, Disney on Ice shows, and live-action clips for television. Les Perkins did the voice of Mickey in two TV specials, \"Down and Out with Donald Duck\" and \"DTV Valentine\", in the mid-1980s. Quinton Flynn briefly filled in for Allwine as the voice of Mickey in a few episodes of the first season of Mickey Mouse Works whenever Allwine was unavailable to record. Bret Iwan , a former Hallmark greeting card artist, has been the official voice of Mickey since 2009. Iwan was originally cast as an understudy for Allwine due to the latter's declining health, but Allwine died before Iwan could get a chance to meet him and Iwan became the new official voice of the character at the time.

Films and theater The multi- Academy Award -winning 1955 film Marty , an independently produced movie that undercut the Hollywood studio system, provided a business template Klein closely studied and later adapted to the recording industry. In the late 1950s Klein shared an office with press agent Bernie Kamber, who represented Burt Lancaster , one of Marty 's producers. Klein absorbed much from Kamber about how the producers had structured their business model, a paradigm whose strength derived from the fact that artists, not film studios or record labels, drove marketplace success and that intense preparation and canny negotiation could lavishly reward artists and their representatives. In 1961 Klein did accountancy work for an independent film, Force of Impulse , and formed lasting relationships that he turned to for many film projects of his own. In 1962 he produced a film, Without Each Other . He took it to the Cannes Film Festival and later claimed that it had won the \"Best American Picture Award\" there, though no such award existed. A distributor never materialized, but Klein's enthusiasm for film persisted. Starting in 1967 Klein produced four films in the Spaghetti Western genre, a lean-and-mean style of cowboy movie with taciturn heroes and explosive violence. Klein used actor Tony Anthony , whom he'd met on Force of Impulse , in all four. Their films included a trilogy comprising A Stranger In Town , The Stranger Returns (1967), and The Silent Stranger",
