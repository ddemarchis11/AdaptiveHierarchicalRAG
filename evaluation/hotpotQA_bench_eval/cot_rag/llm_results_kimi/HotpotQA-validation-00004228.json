      "text": "Alton A. Lindsey (May 7, 1907 – December 19, 1999) was a pioneering ecologist who was largely responsible for the creation of nature preserves in the state of Indiana , where he was a professor of forest ecology at Purdue University from 1947 to 1973. His book, \"Natural Areas of Indiana and Their Preservation\" (published 1970), was used to support the creation of Indiana's first nature preserve, Pine Hills Nature Preserve, and he was also instrumental in the creation of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore . The Army Corps of Engineers plan to dam Big Walnut Creek in Indiana was also halted due to the efforts of Lindsey and a number of other activists; today there is also a large nature preserve along the Big Walnut. Lindsey was on Admiral Byrd ’s second Antarctica expedition as a biologist and brought a number of penguins back to the states with him, before he had even graduated from Cornell University . He was nationally known for his work in ecology, and published several books on ecological and other areas of natural history . He published 10 books (not counting some small-press books of nature poetry , many of a humorous nature) in addition to scientific articles. Lindsey was a founding member of The Nature Conservancy . Honors: Named Eminent Ecologist of 1976, Ecological Society of America Antarctican Lindsey Islands named for him. Fellowships established in his name at Purdue University and Goshen College",

She served as president of the Ecological Society of Australia in 2011–13. She initiated a collaborative project, the Ecosystem Science Long-Term Plan , including the Australian Academy of Science and the Terrestrial Environmental Research Network, which resulted in the publication of the report \"Foundations for the future: A long-term plan for Australian ecosystem science\", an advisory document for government. She has served on the group's steering committee since 2013.

Covington is known for his research and outreach activities on conservation, forest health, fire ecology , and ecological restoration, drawn from his research since 1970 on the ponderosa pine , aspen, dry mixed conifer, and pinyon-juniper forests and woodlands of the West, particularly those that surround Flagstaff, Arizona . He has been called perhaps the nation's most visible forest scientist, by Science magazine . Biography Covington spent his youth in Oklahoma and Texas . His father, who died when Covington was young, instilled in his son a love and respect of nature. They spent every other weekend out of doors, living off the land. He also introduced his son to the teachings of restoration pioneer Aldo Leopold , who became a major influence on Covington. Covington's mother was a schoolteacher, and encouraged his scholastic nature. Covington excelled at school, and received his B.A. (honors) in Biology at the University of North Texas in 1969. He enrolled directly in medical school, with the intention of studying pediatric oncology. The emotional nature of the work took its toll, however, and he took a year's leave to teach school in Gallup, New Mexico .",

      "text": "The emotional nature of the work took its toll, however, and he took a year's leave to teach school in Gallup, New Mexico . He never returned to medical school. Instead, inspired by ecology classes taken as an undergraduate, he enrolled in the graduate program at the University of New Mexico , where he earned an M.S. in ecology in 1972. Covington continued on to earn a Master of Forestry in 1974 and a Ph.D. in 1976 from Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, where Leopold studied. Covington joined the faculty at Northern Arizona University in 1975, and began researching the ponderosa pine forests in the area. In 1996 Covington became the founder and director of the new Ecological Restoration Program, established with funding provided by the Arizona legislature to NAU. Researchers from the program began to work with land managers to design, implement, and monitor restoration treatments at a variety of sites in the West. In 2004 Congress passed PL 108-317 establishing the Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at NAU and sister institutes in Colorado (the Colorado Forest Restoration Institute at Colorado State University ) and New Mexico (the New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute at New Mexico Highlands University). The ERI, along with its sister institutes, provides ecological restoration research, development, and outreach throughout the West, as well as work experience, formal course work, and thesis opportunities for undergraduate and graduate",
