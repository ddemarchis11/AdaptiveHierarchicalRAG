History Early years and first album (1981–1983) Violent Femmes were founded by bassist Brian Ritchie and percussionist Victor DeLorenzo in 1981, joined shortly thereafter by lead vocalist and guitarist Gordon Gano . According to Ritchie, he came up with the name of the group as a fake band name when one of his bandmates questioned his assertion that his brother was also in a band. He and DeLorenzo liked the name, so they used it for the rhythm duo in which they played prior to Gano joining the group. In its early days, the band frequently played coffee houses and street corners. They were discovered by James Honeyman-Scott (of the Pretenders ) on August 23, 1981, when the band was busking on a street corner in front of the Oriental Theatre , the Milwaukee venue that The Pretenders would be playing later that night. Chrissie Hynde invited them to play a brief acoustic set after the opening act. In 1983, the band released their self-titled debut album, Violent Femmes . Later years and brief split (1984–1992) The band at the Sydney Opera House (1990).",

After releasing two more albums, Hallowed Ground (1984) and The Blind Leading the Naked (1986), the band's future was uncertain and they split up in 1987 when Gano and Ritchie went solo. They regrouped a year later, however, releasing their fourth album 3 (1989). The follow-up album, Why Do Birds Sing? (1991), contains the fan favorite and concert staple \"American Music\".  In 1993, founding member Victor DeLorenzo (percussion, snare drum) left Violent Femmes and was replaced by Guy Hoffman, who debuted on the band's sixth album New Times (1994). Two more albums – Rock!!!!! (1995) and Freak Magnet (2000) – were released with this lineup before DeLorenzo rejoined the band in 2002 for what was to be a farewell tour. Following the commercial failure of Freak Magnet , Violent Femmes did not release any more studio albums for almost two decades, although a number of compilation albums were released in the early 2000s, along with a few one-off songs. Some controversy over the licensing of the band's songs for commercial use led to an official break-up in 2009, though they re-formed in 2013 (shortly before DeLorenzo left Violent Femmes again), and have since released two",

Formed in early 1998, the group was originally centred around the trio of Deron Miller on guitar and lead vocals, Chad I Ginsburg on lead guitar and Jess Margera on drums. The band debuted in 1999 with Volume 1 , gaining underground recognition from its association with the CKY video series produced by Margera's brother, skateboarder Bam Margera . After signing with The Island Def Jam Music Group , CKY released its second album Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild in 2002, which reached the top half of the US Billboard 200 chart. The 2005 follow-up An Answer Can Be Found reached the US top 40, after which the band (with bassist Matt Deis ) released Carver City on Roadrunner Records . In late-2011, following many years of tensions between himself and the other members, Miller left CKY. Following Miller's departure, CKY spent several years making only sporadic live appearances. The band played shows with stand-in frontman Daniel Davies during 2012 and 2015, before Ginsburg took over lead vocal duties for the group's studio return, 2017's The Phoenix . Deis, who had returned to the band in 2015, left CKY for a second time in 2019, after which Ginsburg and Margera performed with a string of touring",
