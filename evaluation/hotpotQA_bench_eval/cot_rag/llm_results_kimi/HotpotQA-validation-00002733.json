      "text": "Heart of Darkness is an 1899 novella by Polish-British novelist Joseph Conrad , in which sailor Charles Marlow tells the story of his assignment as steamer captain for a Belgian company in the African interior. The novel is widely regarded as a critique of European colonial rule in Africa , whilst also examining the themes of power dynamics and morality. Although Conrad does not name the river on which most of the narrative takes place, at the time of writing, the Congo Free State —the location of the large and economically important Congo River —was a private colony of Belgium's King Leopold II . Marlow is given an assignment to find Kurtz , an ivory trader working on a trading station far up the river, who has \"gone native\" and is the object of Marlow's expedition. Central to Conrad's work is the idea that there is little difference between \"civilised people\" and \"savages\". Heart of Darkness implicitly comments on imperialism and racism. The novella's setting provides the frame for Marlow's story of his fascination for the prolific ivory trader Kurtz. Conrad draws parallels between London (\"the greatest town on earth\") and Africa as places of darkness. Originally issued as a three-part serial story in Blackwood's Magazine to celebrate the 1000th edition of the magazine, Heart of Darkness has been widely republished and translated in many languages. It provided the inspiration for Francis Ford Coppola 's 1979 film Apocalypse Now . In 1998,",

      "text": "Heart of Darkness was later included in the book Youth, A Narrative; and Two Other Stories , published on 13 November 1902 by William Blackwood , although it was originally intended to be published in a Marlow trilogy, consisting of Youth , Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim . The Blackwood volume consisted of Youth: A Narrative , Heart of Darkness and The End of the Tether in that order. In 1917, for future editions of the book, Conrad wrote an \"Author's Note\" where he, after denying any \"unity of artistic purpose\" underlying the collection, discusses each of the three stories and makes light commentary on Marlow, the narrator of the tales within the first two stories. He said Marlow first appeared in Youth . On 31 May 1902, in a letter to William Blackwood, Conrad remarked, I call your own kind self to witness ... the last pages of Heart of Darkness where the interview of the man and the girl locks in—as it were—the whole 30 000 words of narrative description into one suggestive view of a whole phase of life and makes of that story something quite on another plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa. Researchers have suggested more than twenty prototypes for the character of Kurtz. Georges-Antoine Klein, an agent who became ill and died aboard Conrad's steamer, is proposed by literary critics as a basis for Kurtz. The principal figures involved in the disastrous",

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Heart of Darkness 67th on their list of the 100 best novels in English of the 20th century. Composition and publication Joseph Conrad based Heart of Darkness on his own experiences in the Congo . In 1890, at the age of 32, Conrad was appointed by a Belgian trading company to serve on one of its steamers . While sailing up the Congo River from one station to another, the captain became ill and Conrad assumed command. He guided the ship up the tributary Lualaba River to the trading company's innermost station, Kindu , in Eastern Congo Free State ; Marlow has similar experiences to the author. When Conrad began to write the novella, eight years after returning from Africa, he drew inspiration from his travel journals . He described Heart of Darkness as \"a wild story\" of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the (African) interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of natives. The tale was first published as a three-part serial, in February, March, and April 1899, in Blackwood's Magazine (February 1899 was the magazine's 1000th issue: special edition).

The novel ends upon that cry, and it is unclear whether his decision is too late, whether it is the right one, and whether he, others, and the country itself will receive the help needed. Relation to other texts The novel can be related in many ways to the seminal works of Frantz Fanon , specifically Black Skin, White Masks . Fanon discusses the politics of desire between black men and white women, as Salih also explores extensively in the relationships of Mustafa Sa'eed.  Also, it has been compared in many ways to Joseph Conrad 's Heart of Darkness . Both novels explore cultural hybridity , cross-colonial experiences, and Orientalism . The novel is also set in the same village, Wad Hamid, as some of Salih's other works, including The Wedding of Zein , Bandarshah , and others. Many of the novel's characters, such as Mahjoub and the narrator, recur in these other works as well. Thus, Ami Elad-Boulaski writes that Salih's depiction of Wad Hamid is more fully realized because a reader can track the development of characters throughout multiple novels and short stories.

      "text": "Season of Migration to the North ( Arabic : موسم الهجرة إلى الشمال Mawsim al-Hijrah ilâ al-Shamâl ) is a novel by the Sudanese writer Tayeb Salih , first published serially in the Beirut journal Hiwâr in 1966. It became Salih's best known work and is considered a classic of postcolonial literature . The main concern of the novel is the impact of British colonialism and European modernity on rural African societies in general and Sudanese culture and identity in particular. The novel reflects the conflicts of modern Sudan and depicts the brutal history of European colonialism as shaping the reality of contemporary Sudanese society. Damascus-based Arab Literary Academy named it one of the best novels in Arabic of the 20th century. Mawsim al-Hijrah ilâ al-Shamâl is considered to be an important turning point in the development of postcolonial narratives that focus on the encounter between East and West. The novel has been translated into over twenty languages. Salih was fluent in both English and Arabic, but chose to pen this novel in Arabic. The English translation by Denys Johnson-Davies was published in 1969 as part of the influential Heinemann African Writers Series . The novel is a counternarrative to Heart of Darkness . It was described by Edward Said as one of the six great novels in Arabic literature. In 2001 it was",
