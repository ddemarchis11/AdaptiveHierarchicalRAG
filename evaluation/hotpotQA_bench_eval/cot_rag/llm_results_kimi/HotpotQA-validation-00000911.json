      "text": "Elodea is a genus of eight species of aquatic plants often called the waterweeds described as a genus in 1803. Classified in the frog's-bit family ( Hydrocharitaceae ), Elodea is native to the Americas and is also widely used as aquarium vegetation and laboratory demonstrations of cellular activities. It lives in fresh water. An older name for this genus is Anacharis , which serves as a common name in North America. The introduction of some species of Elodea into waterways in parts of Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand has created a significant problem and it is now considered a noxious weed in these areas. Species Elodea bifoliata H.St.John – Canada ( AB , SK ), W United States ( OR + CA to NM + MN ) Elodea callitrichoides (Rich.) Casp. – Argentina, Uruguay Elodea canadensis Michx. – most of United States + Canada Elodea densa (Planch.) Casp.

They are prostrate to medium-tall annual , biennial or perennial herbs growing up to 1 m high in wet soil, often marshes and salt marshes , and have pinnate to bipinnate leaves and small white flowers in compound umbels . Some species are edible, notably Apium graveolens , which is the wild ancestor of the commercially important vegetables celery , celeriac and leaf celery . The genus is the type genus of the family Apiaceae and the order Apiales; the type species of the genus is Apium graveolens .
