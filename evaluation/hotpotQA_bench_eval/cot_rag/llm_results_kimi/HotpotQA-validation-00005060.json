On December 12, 2020, creator Michelle Khare released YouTube Rewind 2020: The Musical onto her own channel after releasing a trailer three days prior. Due to fan backlash over the inclusion of a lookalike of Jenna Marbles , who left YouTube in June 2020, the video was set to private. In a similar fashion to PewDiePie's Rewind 2018 and 2019, on January 1, 2021, MrBeast released his own version of YouTube Rewind for 2020, titled YouTube Rewind 2020: Thank God It's Over , which focused on the notable memes of 2020, and paid homage to personalities who had died in the year, including Kobe Bryant and Chadwick Boseman . On October 7, 2021, YouTube announced that Rewind would be discontinued, expressing hope that its creators would fill in the gap. Instead, a 24-hour interactive livestream titled Escape2021 was broadcast on December 16 as a replacement, including a live performance by BTS on Minecraft produced by the Noxcrew and also featuring Minecraft YouTubers Dream , GeorgeNotFound , Aphmau , PrestonPlayz , BriannaPlayz, and BeckBroJack.
