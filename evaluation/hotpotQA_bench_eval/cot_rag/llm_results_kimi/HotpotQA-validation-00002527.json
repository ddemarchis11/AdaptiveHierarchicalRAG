In 1970, the Board of County Supervisors established the Prince William County Police Department which assumed the primary responsibility for law enforcement. In 1982, the Prince William County Adult Detention Center opened and assumed the duties of jailers. The Sheriff is a constitutional office elected by the Prince William County, City of Manassas and City of Manassas Park to provide certain public safety services. History The PWCSO was founded in 1731 and was the sole law enforcement agency for the county until 1970, when most patrol and investigations duties were turned over to the newly-formed Police Department. The agency is now responsible for courtroom security, all jail and prisoner operations, court orders and civil process operations, and fugitive tracking and apprehension. As of 2022 [update] the sheriff is Sheriff Glendell Hill (R), who has held the position since 2004. Hill is the county's first Black sheriff.
