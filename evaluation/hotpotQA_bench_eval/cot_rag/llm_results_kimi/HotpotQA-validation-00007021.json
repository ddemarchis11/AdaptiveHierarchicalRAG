      "text": "Erving Goffman (11 June 1922 – 19 November 1982) was a Canadian-born American sociologist , social psychologist , and writer, considered by some \"the most influential American sociologist of the twentieth century\". In 2007, The Times Higher Education Guide listed him as the sixth most-cited author of books in the humanities and social sciences . Goffman was the 73rd president of the American Sociological Association . His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction . This took the form of dramaturgical analysis , beginning with his 1956 book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life . Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life , social interaction , the social construction of self, social organization ( framing ) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas . Early life and education Goffman was born 11 June 1922, in Mannville, Alberta , Canada, to Max Goffman and Anne Goffman, née Averbach.

For instance. when an individual from an upper-class background goes to a black-tie affair, the definition of the situation is that they must mind their manners and act according to their class. In 2007 by The Times Higher Education Guide listed Goffman as the sixth most-cited author in the humanities and social sciences , behind Michel Foucault , Pierre Bourdieu , and Anthony Giddens , and ahead of Jürgen Habermas . His popularity with the general public has been attributed to his writing style, described as \"sardonic, satiric, jokey\", and as \"ironic and self-consciously literary\", and to its being more accessible than that of most academics. His style has also been influential in academia, and is credited with popularizing a less formal style in academic publications. Interestingly, if he is rightly so credited, he may by this means have contributed to a remodelling of the norms of academic behaviour, particularly of communicative action, arguably liberating intellectuals from social restraints unnatural to some of them. His students included Carol Brooks Gardner, Charles Goodwin , Marjorie Harness Goodwin , John Lofland , Gary T. Marx , Harvey Sacks , Emanuel Schegloff , David Sudnow and Eviatar Zerubavel .
