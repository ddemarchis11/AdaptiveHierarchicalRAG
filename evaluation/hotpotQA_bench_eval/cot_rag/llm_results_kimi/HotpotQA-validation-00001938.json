While Dotrice was in California, her father stayed in England—where he was portraying King Lear —and Walt Disney personally took care of her family, often hosting them in his Palm Springs home. Dotrice took quickly to Disney as a father figure, calling him \"Uncle Walt\". She said that the admiration was mutual: \"I think he really liked English kids. He was tickled pink by the accent and the etiquette. And when I was being very English and polite, he would look proudly at this little child who had such good manners.\" Film historian Leonard Maltin said Dotrice \"won over everyone\" with her performance in The Three Lives of Thomasina , and Dotrice was signed to play Jane Banks (along with Matthew Garber as her brother, Michael Banks) in Mary Poppins (1964). Disney's part- live-action , part- animation musical adaptation of the Poppins children's books by P. L. Travers starred David Tomlinson as a workaholic father and Glynis Johns as a suffragette mother who are too busy to spend much time with their children. Instead, they hire a nanny ( Julie Andrews ) who takes Jane and Michael on magical adventures designed to teach them—and their parents—about the importance of family. Poppins was Disney's biggest commercial success at the time and won five Academy Awards , making its stars world-famous. Dotrice and Garber were praised for their natural screen presence; critic",

Dotrice noted a common thread; Travers was eight years old when her father died, and Walt Disney's father put him to work when he was eight. \"I was eight when I did the film. I think P. L. Travers was trying to fix families [with the Poppins books, and Disney] wanted to heal people through his movies. Here I am 50 years later looking at this—I was crying when I was watching the film.\" In 2018, she appeared on a television special of Mary Poppins Returns: Behind the Magic – A Special Edition of 20/20 which aired on 22 November 2018 on ABC. She makes a cameo appearance in Mary Poppins Returns as an elegant lady who passes by the main characters on Cherry Tree Lane and asks for directions to #19 . Talking about the cameo, Dotrice said, \"Now that Mary Poppins is back it feels like she was here all along. She was in our hearts all along, that's for sure. I think her timing is immaculate, the world has never needed her more and so she's done it practically perfectly.\" That experience stood in contrast to her memories of working on Poppins . \"The joy that you see on the screen is the joy we felt.\" Dotrice recalled having a difficult time staying in character whenever Dick Van Dyke would do one of his \"goofy dances\".",

      "text": "\"because you don't have to put on any make-up.\" Dotrice was coaxed back into the spotlight twice in 2004: she was named a Disney Legend at a ceremony in Burbank (at which Matthew Garber and Irwin Kostal , the movie's musical director, were honoured posthumously), and she was interviewed and provided audio commentary for the 40th Anniversary Edition Mary Poppins DVD release. Dotrice also provided audio commentary for the Acorn Media DVD release of Upstairs, Downstairs Series 5, discussing Episode 7 (\" Disillusion \"), the final episode in which she appears. Despite having retired from acting, Dotrice's official website announced in 2014 that she will be making public appearances \"for the first time in 50 years\". The list includes memorabilia shows, signings, and corporate events. Looking back Almost a half-century after Poppins , and just in time for its 50th-anniversary Blu-ray re-release and the theatrical release of Saving Mr. Banks , Dotrice, who had since moved to Brentwood, California , told the Los Angeles Times that it was not until seeing Saving Mr. Banks that she truly understood why Walt Disney was the father figure she remembered. \"I didn't know P. L. Travers' history\" with Disney and his many years spent trying to convince Travers to let him tell the Poppins story on film. Dotrice noted a common thread; Travers was eight years old when",

She also thought it odd that Julie Andrews was a smoker . \"Everybody smoked back then. I have memories of Mary Poppins smoking a cigarette\". Still, in hindsight, Dotrice said she would never have done Poppins or any of her other films if she had it to do over again. Dotrice said children \"should be learning and growing at their own pace\" rather than \"living in a Justin Bieber -esque-type world surrounded by a bunch of 'yes' people\". Dotrice had seen so many of her peers struggling with \"all sorts of demons\" while growing up that she did not want her children becoming actors. Dotrice said that she gave up her own career when she was asked as a teenager to appear topless on screen.
