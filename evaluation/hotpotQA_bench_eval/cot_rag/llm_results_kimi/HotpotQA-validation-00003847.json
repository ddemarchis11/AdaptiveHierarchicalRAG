      "text": "Dean Mills Reservoir is a small water reservoir to the north of the town of Bolton , Greater Manchester located high on the slopes of Winter Hill . The reservoir was constructed above the village of Barrow Bridge by John and Robert Lord. “The Lord Brothers opened a mill there in the late 18th Century using Crompton's spinning mules. With the success of this operation they built a water-powered mill further down the valley and carried out ambitious waterworks including the construction of a reservoir, waterfall and sluices to power the mill.” The dark brown appearance of the water in the reservoir is due to discolouration from the surrounding peat that naturally drains into the reservoir. It was put up for sale by auction in March 2018. References",

      "text": "River flows north from the Lower Waterton Lake for approx. 32 km to reach the Waterton Reservoir (Est. 1964) by the village of Hill Spring . The Waterton Reservoir diverts water of about 20 m 3 /s to the Belly River just upstream from the Belly's own diversion weir which diverts water to the St. Mary River . The Waterton continues north from the reservoir for approx. 39 km until it reaches the confluence with the Belly River, which is a tributary of the Oldman River . Waterton River has relatively reduced sediment concentrations due to the lakes and the reservoir acting as a sediment-settling trap. The total length of the river is 80 km (50 mi). Waterton River's mean peak discharge averages about 80 m 3 /s. Tributaries to the Waterton River include: Foothill Creek Drywood Creek Yarrow Creek Dungarvan Creek Galwey Brook Cottonwood Creek Crooked Creek Waterton Reservoir has a Full Supply Level (FSL) of 1,185.67 metres, and an Irrigation Capacity of 114,334 dam 3 .

Plantations of trees and shrubs to meet fuel wood and fodder requirements have been done on the hill slopes. Tourism National Highway skirting the lake on the left Lahaul-Spiti Valley is a common destination for Indian and foreign tourists on road trips, trekking, and motorcycling. The NH 21 route from Manali to Leh covers the Suraj Tal Lake and the Bara-lacha-la pass. Trekking Trekking tours are common. One trek route is the Zingzingbar –Suraj Tal–Bara-lacha-la.
