      "text": "The Samsung Galaxy S6 is a line of Android -based smartphones manufactured, released and marketed by Samsung Electronics . Succeeding the Samsung Galaxy S5 , the S6 was not released as a singular model, but instead in two variations unveiled and marketed together—the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge —with the latter differentiated primarily by having a display that is wrapped along the sides of the device. It is distinguished from its predecessor through an internal battery with an increased charging speed but a decreased capacity, an optically stabilized camera , sound in slow motion video recordings, a glass back, and it lacks a user-replaceable battery, a memory card slot, water resistance, and MHL-to-HDMI connection for viewing on an external monitor or television set. The S6 was the first edge model, this continued with the release of the S7 Edge and was discontinued with the introduction of the successor, the Galaxy S8 Edge . The Edge name returned with the release of the S25 Edge . The S6 and S6 Edge were unveiled on March 1, 2015, during the Samsung Unpacked press event at MWC Barcelona , and released April 10, 2015, marking a counter-utilitarian and fashion-oriented course in the Galaxy S series .

Development Rumors Rumors surrounding the Galaxy S5's successor began to surface in January 2015, it was reported that Samsung would be using an in-house Exynos system-on-chip rather than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 on the S6 due to concerns surrounding overheating. Later that month, Qualcomm affirmed in an earnings report that its products would not be included in \"[a] large customer's flagship device\". Fellow competitor LG Electronics disputed the allegations surrounding the 810; although demo units of the 810-equipped LG G Flex 2 at Consumer Electronics Show experienced signs of possible overheating, the company emphasized that they were pre-release models. In early-February 2015, Bloomberg News reported that the S6 was to have a metal body, and was to be produced in a normal version, and a version with a screen curved along the left and right sides of the device, similarly to the Galaxy Note Edge . The S6's design was officially teased in a promotional webpage released by T-Mobile US on 22 February 2015, which showed a curved body and carried the tagline \"Six Appeal\". Keynote Samsung officially unveiled the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge during the first Samsung Unpacked 2015 event at Mobile World Congress on 1 March 2015, for a release on 10 April 2015 in 20 countries.

Succeeding the S6 and S6 Edge+, respectively, the Samsung Galaxy S7 was produced in a standard model with a display size of 5.1-inch (130 mm) as well as an Edge variant whose display is curved along the wide sides of the screen and also has a larger 5.5-inch (140 mm) display.
