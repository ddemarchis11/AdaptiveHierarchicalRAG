      "text": "The International Grenfell Association ( IGA ) was an organization founded by Sir Wilfred Grenfell to provide health care, education, religious services, and rehabilitation and other social activities to the fisherman and coastal communities in northern Newfoundland and the coast of Labrador . It was originally a branch of the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen and was widely known as the Grenfell Mission . Before 1892 there were no medical facilities or personnel along the coast of Labrador aside from a Moravian Mission that provided basic medical care and an occasional doctor that the Newfoundland government sent on a mail ship. Grenfell undertook a medical expedition in 1892 on the hospital ship the Albert . He saw medical and living conditions that appalled him, including settlements that had been wiped out by diphtheria . In response, he developed a network of regional hospitals and nursing stations. The first hospitals were built at Battle Harbour in 1893 and Indian Harbour in 1894. By the 1960s, the network had extended into the interior of Labrador. The IGA was incorporated in the Dominion of Newfoundland on January 10, 1914, under the Companies Act of 1899. In 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for the treatment of children who, between 1949 and 1979, were separated from their families and sent to boarding schools run by the IGA.

      "text": "up a plaque saying, \"Who gave their lives for me.\" By 1914 the mission had gained international status. In order to manage its property and affairs, the International Grenfell Association , a non-profit mission society, was founded to support Grenfell's work. The Association operated until 1981, as an NGO . It had responsibility for delivery of healthcare and social services in northern Newfoundland and Labrador. After 1981 a governmental agency, The Grenfell Regional Health Services Board took over the operational responsibility. The International Grenfell Association, having divested itself of all properties and operational responsibility for health and social services, boarding schools and hospitals then became a supporting association making grants and funding scholarships for medical training. For his years of service on behalf of the people of these communities he was later knighted by the King in 1927. In 1931, Grenfell had a small speaking role in the film, The Viking , in which he narrated the film's prologue and gave a brief statement of the tragic circumstances involving the film's production. During the production of the film, which was filmed on location in Newfoundland, producer Varick Frissell felt that the film needed more action sequences and set out on the ice floes to film them. During filming, the ship, SS Viking on which filming was taking place, exploded, killing Frissell and 27 others. Personal life He married Anne Elizabeth Caldwell MacClanahan (died 1938) of Chicago",
