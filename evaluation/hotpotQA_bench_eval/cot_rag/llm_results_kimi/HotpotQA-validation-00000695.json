According to Jack, the song tells the story of a person who, upon entering a town, hears its residents gossiping about him and proceeds to leave the town in response. Driven by a sense of loneliness, he ultimately returns. Regarding the song's meaning, Jack stated, \"The song's about gossip. It's about me, Meg and the people we're dating.\" Maginnis described the lyrics as presenting an \"obstinate attitude\", citing the first verse: \"I'm gonna fight 'em off / A seven nation army couldn't hold me back / They're gonna rip it off / Taking their time right behind my back\". In regards to the line \"I'm going to Wichita / Far from this opera forevermore\", Jack said he has never visited the city, but was using it as metaphor and getting himself into character for the song with the lyric. Release Jack's idea of releasing \"Seven Nation Army\" as a single faced opposition from the White Stripes' record label, XL Recordings, which wanted to release the song \" There's No Home for You Here \" instead. Jack persuaded the label to release \"Seven Nation Army\", and in 2003 it was released as a promotional single alongside Elephant track \" In the Cold, Cold Night \". It was subsequently released in 2013 as a 7-inch vinyl single and a CD single; the former included a cover of \"Good to Me\"—written by Brendan Benson and Jason Falkner",
