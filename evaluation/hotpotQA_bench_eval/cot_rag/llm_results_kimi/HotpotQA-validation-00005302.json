      "text": "Jersey barriers on the road A Jersey barrier , Jersey wall , or Jersey bump is a modular concrete or plastic barrier employed to separate lanes of traffic . It is designed to minimize vehicle damage in cases of incidental contact while still preventing vehicle crossovers resulting in a likely head-on collision . Jersey barriers are also used to reroute traffic and protect pedestrians and workers during highway construction. They are named after the U.S. state of New Jersey , which first started using the barriers as separators between lanes of a highway in the 1950s. The barriers are also known as a K-rail , a term stipulated in the California Department of Transportation specification for temporary concrete traffic barriers. Over time, different variants were created. Taller variants, such as the Ontario tall wall , proved more effective at stopping vehicles and had the added advantage of blocking most oncoming headlights. More modular variants, including plastic water-filled barriers, have been created. Development and use 42-inch-high (11 dm) variation of the Jersey barrier known as an Ontario Tall Wall Although it is not clear exactly when or where the first concrete median barriers were used, concrete median barriers were used in the mid-1940s on U.S. Route 99 on the descent from the Tehachapi Mountains in the Central Valley south of Bakersfield, California . This first generation of concrete barriers was developed to minimize the number of out-of-control trucks penetrating the barrier and eliminate the need for costly and dangerous median barrier maintenance in",

Variations Modern variations include the constant-slope barrier and the F-shape barrier . The F-shape is generally similar to the Jersey barrier in appearance, but is taller, with somewhat different angles. The UK equivalent is the concrete step barrier .  First tested in 1968 by the then Department of Highways in Ontario, Canada , the Ontario Tall Wall is a variant of the Jersey barrier. Standing at 42 inches (107 cm), it is 10 inches (25 cm) taller than the standard Jersey barrier. Ontario's Ministry of Transportation has been replacing guiderails (steel guardrail and steel box-beam) with these tall wall barriers on 400-series highways since the early 1990s, while the City of Toronto is doing likewise on portions of the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway . Plastic Jersey barriers Plastic Jersey barriers ( Hong Kong , 2008) Hollow polyethylene barriers have been developed for short-term applications where portability is important. These plastic barriers are normally filled with water after placement on-site to provide a moderate level of crash protection, then emptied prior to removal. They are not designed to deflect vehicles, so vehicles may penetrate the barriers. These barriers can also be filled with sand at the cost of reduced portability.

It connects PA 309 in Lanark , Lehigh County , north to PA 248 in Lehigh Gap , Northampton County . PA 145 is the main north–south arterial into Allentown , the third-largest city in the state. The route enters the city on South 4th Street and follows multiple streets to Center City Allentown , where it follows the one-way pair of 6th Street northbound and 7th Street southbound. North of Allentown in Whitehall Township , a seven-mile (11.2 km) portion of PA 145 is known as MacArthur Road , named in honor of General Douglas MacArthur . MacArthur Road is a divided highway ; between U.S. Route 22 (US 22) and Eberhart Road, it is six lanes wide with a Jersey barrier and jughandles while the remainder of the road a four-lane divided highway. MacArthur Road is the location of the main commercial center of the Lehigh Valley. North of Eagle Point , PA 145 becomes a two-lane undivided road that parallels the Lehigh River , crossing the river into Northampton County at Treichlers . The route continues along the east bank of the river and passes through Walnutport before reaching its northern terminus.",

      "text": "generation of concrete barriers was developed to minimize the number of out-of-control trucks penetrating the barrier and eliminate the need for costly and dangerous median barrier maintenance in high-accident locations with narrow medians. The Jersey barrier, also called New Jersey wall, was developed in the 1950s (introduced in current form in 1959), at Stevens Institute of Technology , New Jersey , United States, under the direction of the New Jersey State Highway Department to divide multiple lanes on a highway. A typical Jersey barrier stands 32 inches (81 cm) tall and is made of steel-reinforced poured concrete or plastic. Many are constructed with the embedded steel reinforcement protruding from each end, allowing them to be incorporated into permanent emplacements when linked to one another by sections of fresh concrete poured on-site. Their widespread use in road construction has led to wide application as a generic, portable barrier during construction projects and temporary rerouting of traffic into stopgap carpool and rush-hour reversing highway lanes. Most of the original barriers constructed in New Jersey in the 1950s and early 1960s were not \"modular\"; they were formed from concrete poured in place. Many of the first installations (Route 46 in Bergen County and Passaic County, for instance) were about two feet (61 cm) tall, much shorter than modern heights. Some dividers on county or local roads may have been lower than that, since they replaced a raised concrete rumble strip that would",

The portion of PA 145 along Seventh Street Pike was widened to four lanes between Allentown and west of Coplay by 1947. In the early 1950s, Seventh Street Pike was renamed to MacArthur Road in honor of General Douglas MacArthur , a World War II hero. PA 145 northbound approaching Grape Street in Whitehall Township Following the completion of the US 22 freeway in 1955, the southern terminus of PA 145 was cut back to the cloverleaf interchange with I-78/US 22 in Whitehall Township. Also, US 309 and PA 29 were rerouted to bypass Allentown to the south and west in the 1950s, leaving the former alignment unnumbered. By 1961, PA 145 was realigned to bypass the center of Walnutport to the east along Best Avenue, having previously passed through the borough on Washington Street, Main Street, Cherry Street, and Spruce Street. By 1970, PA 145 was widened into a divided highway between US 22 and north of PA 329; the portion between US 22 and Eberhart Road was constructed as a six-lane divided highway in 1969. The section of the route in Whitehall Township developed into a major retail center for the Lehigh Valley in the second half of the 20th",
