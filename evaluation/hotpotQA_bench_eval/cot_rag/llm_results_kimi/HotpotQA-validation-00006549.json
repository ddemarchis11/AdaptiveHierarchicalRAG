The Yankee Stadium fights were filmed at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. Soundtrack Perry Como 's version of the title song is played over the opening and closing credits. Reception Box office According to MGM records, the film earned $1,915,000 in the US and Canada and $1,445,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $609,000. Critical response The casting of blond-haired Midwesterner Newman, whose only prior film role was in the poorly-received The Silver Chalice , as the dark-haired New Yorker Graziano had been treated skeptically in the lead-up to the film's release. However, Newman's performance was generally well-received, with several contemporary reviews likening him to Marlon Brando , and the film helped launch his career as a film star. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.

The series stars Lee Bowman (who had previously played sleuth Ellery Queen on television) and boxer-turned-actor Rocky Graziano . Most episodes were shot on location in Miami . Synopsis Jeff Thompson is a private investigator working for the Miami Hotel Owners' Association. Each episode featured \"a different beauty contest winner\". Cast Lee Bowman as Jeff Thompson Rocky Graziano as Rocky Episodes Production United Artists' (UA) Aubrey Schenck-Howard W. Koch Productions filmed 38 episodes of Miami Undercover in Florida in the fall of 1959. Limited time slots for syndicated series and an excess of shows that featured private investigators resulted in the show's not being broadcast until January 1961. By then UA had acquired Ziv Productions, whose sales people helped to gain 141 markets for the show. An additional factor was that the UA-Ziv combination had no other new programs to meet its commitments for January 1961. References External links Miami Undercover at IMDb v t e",
