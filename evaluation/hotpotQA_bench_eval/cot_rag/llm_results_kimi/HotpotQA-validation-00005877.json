  "question": "Which musician obtained fame first, Terry Kath or Róisín Murphy?",
  "gold_answer": "Terry Alan Kath",
  "llm_answer": "Terry Kath obtained fame first.  \nEvidence: Terry Kath was active and gaining recognition with the band Chicago (formerly The Chicago Transit Authority) from 1969 onward, including landmark albums released in 1969 and 1970.  \nRóisín Murphy, by contrast, first became known in the 1990s as part of the duo Moloko.  \nThus, Kath’s rise to fame predates Murphy’s by more than two decades.",

      "text": "Róisín Marie Murphy ( / r oʊ ˈ ʃ iː n / roh- SHEEN , Irish Gaelic: [ɾˠoːˈʃiːnʲ] ; born 5 July 1973) is an Irish singer, songwriter and record producer who first became known in the 1990s as one half of the pop duo Moloko alongside the English musician Mark Brydon . After the breakup of Moloko, Murphy embarked on a solo career and released her debut solo album Ruby Blue (2005), which she wrote and produced with the experimental musician Matthew Herbert , to critical praise. Her second solo album Overpowered was released in 2007. In 2015, after an eight-year hiatus that was sporadically interrupted by non-album singles, side projects and guest appearances on other artists' records, Murphy released her third solo album Hairless Toys , which was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and Ireland's Choice Music Prize . The following year, she released her fourth album Take Her Up to Monto . In 2018, she released four 12-inch singles in collaboration with producer Maurice Fulton. Murphy released her fifth and sixth solo albums Róisín Machine and Hit Parade , which received critical acclaim, in 2020 and 2023, respectively. Early life Róisín Marie Murphy was born in Arklow , County Wicklow, in the Republic of Ireland",

The film made its world premiere at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival , renamed as The Terry Kath Experience , and Peter Cetera was listed among the cast members. It made its United States premiere at the DOC NYC film festival in November 2016 under the same name, and was soon after acquired by FilmRise , which planned a 2017 release. The film made its television premiere on AXS TV , under the name Chicago: The Terry Kath Experience , on November 7, 2017, and it was released as VOD and DVD on December 12. The film includes interviews with guitarists Jeff Lynne , Steve Lukather , Mike Campbell , Dean DeLeo and Joe Walsh , who all praised Kath's work. Walsh said, \"He was a great guy; he was a brilliant musician. He was a songwriter and a great singer. He was such a monster on guitar. ... He was just a total experimenter\". On April 8, 2016, Chicago was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Michelle Kath Sinclair accepted the award on her father's behalf.

      "text": "member Walter Parazaider later said, \"If [Kath] was totally up front, he would have gotten a lot more recognition.\" According to Parazaider, Jimi Hendrix commented to him after a set at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles that \"your guitar player is better than me.\" In September 1997, Chicago released Chicago Presents The Innovative Guitar of Terry Kath , a CD remembrance of their late guitarist, on their own short-lived Chicago Records label. Band members have since wondered if Kath would have stayed with Chicago had he lived or started a solo career. In 2010, Parazaider said: \"I'm not sure about that. [Terry] was a free spirit ... He was his own person when it came to different things. I would like to think he (would still be with Chicago) but he was very independent and I wonder what he would have thought about the 1980s. I'd have to say it's 50/50. It could have gone either way.\" In 2012, Kath's daughter Michelle Kath Sinclair announced that enough funds had been donated to complete production on a documentary of his life, titled Searching for Terry: Discovering a Guitar Legend . In 2014, she confirmed she had interviewed the entire band except for Cetera and the project was planned for release in 2016.
