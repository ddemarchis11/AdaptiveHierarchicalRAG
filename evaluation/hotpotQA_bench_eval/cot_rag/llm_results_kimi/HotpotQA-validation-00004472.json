      "text": "The Jaguar R2 was the car with which the Jaguar team competed in the 2001 Formula One season. It was driven by Eddie Irvine , who was in his second year with the team, and Luciano Burti , who had deputised for Irvine at the 2000 Austrian Grand Prix . However, the Brazilian was replaced by Pedro de la Rosa after only four Grands Prix. This was the last Formula One car to run on Texaco fuel. Overview The R2 being prepared for a public appearance For Jaguar, 2001 was a season of consolidation after a disastrous début season in 2000 saw the team score only four points in the Constructors' Championship. The car was therefore more conservative and reliable than in the previous year, and the team's success was slightly greater, if not a quantum leap forward. Indeed, there were only four points finishes from Irvine and de la Rosa throughout the season, although one of these was Jaguar's maiden podium finish at Monaco . The season was more notable for Jaguar's exploits off the track. McLaren designer Adrian Newey seemingly signed a contract with the team, but quickly changed his mind and remained with his current employers. The deal was struck by Team Principal Bobby Rahal , and its failure, allied to an alleged deal to sell Irvine to Jordan , would culminate in his replacement by fellow retired racer Niki Lauda by season's end.

Despite his vocal frustrations, Jaguar team principal Bobby Rahal backed Irvine for the upcoming season, although Irvine was not confident citing his uncertainty about his team becoming competitive which he has made vocal. Rahal became concerned over Irvine's attitude when the team's car, the Jaguar R2 , was underperforming during pre-season testing. Irvine supported the view of being sacked at the end of the season if his performances did not satisfy the team. Irvine clinched 11th place in the first round in Australia and failed to finish in the next four consecutive races. Before the Spanish Grand Prix , Burti left Jaguar to join the Prost team so Irvine was partnered with Pedro de la Rosa .
