By the mid-1980s, Billy Gould stated the band were in a \"weird spot\", as their eclectic sound didn't fit in with the burgeoning hardcore punk and alternative rock movements of the era. Upon Mike Patton's arrival in 1988, the band began to expand their sound range even further, merging disparate genres such as synth-pop , thrash metal , and carousel music on The Real Thing .

Common Sense Media wrote that the film is successful in Ephron's hands, despite its \"frustrating\" structure at times.
