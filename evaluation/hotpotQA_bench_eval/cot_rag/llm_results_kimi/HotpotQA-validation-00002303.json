      "text": "failed. A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers , was signed by John Albion Andrew , the governor of Massachusetts , on April 10, 1861. Rogers, a geologist who had recently arrived in Boston from the University of Virginia , wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances. He did not wish to found a professional school , but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education , proposing that: The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws. The Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model , emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories. Early developments Original Rogers Building in Back Bay, Boston , 1872 Two days after MIT was chartered, the first battle of the Civil War broke out. After a long delay through the war years, MIT's first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865.

      "text": "The Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts , United States. Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science . William Barton Rogers founded MIT in 1861 to provide \"useful knowledge\" amid American industrialization . Initially funded by a federal land grant , the institute adopted a German polytechnic model emphasizing laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering , and moved from Boston to Cambridge in 1916. Early growth came through research contracts with private industry, though the institute remained financially constrained and vocationally oriented into the 1930s. MIT's transformation as a research enterprise began during World War II , when projects like the Radiation Laboratory made it the nation's largest civilian R&D contractor. Graduate enrollment and research funding grew rapidly in the postwar decades as faculty like Vannevar Bush shaped a new system of federal support for basic science. In the late twentieth century, MIT became closely associated with computer science , artificial intelligence , biotechnology , and \"big science\" initiatives like the Apollo program and the LIGO detector . Engineering remains its largest school, though MIT has also developed leading programs in basic science, economics, management, architecture, and humanities. The institute has an entrepreneurial culture and its faculty and alumni have founded many notable companies. MIT has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) along the Charles River . Academic buildings are connected by an extensive corridor",

The initialism IHTFP , representing the informal school motto \"I Hate This Fucking Place\" and jocularly euphemized as \"I Have Truly Found Paradise\", \"Institute Has The Finest Professors\", \"Institute of Hacks, TomFoolery and Pranks\", \"It's Hard to Fondle Penguins\", and other variations, has occasionally been featured on the ring given its historical prominence in student culture. Caltech Rivalry MIT also shares a well-known rivalry with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), stemming from both institutions' reputations as two of the highest ranked and most highly recognized science and engineering schools in the world. The rivalry is an unusual college rivalry given its focus on academics and pranks instead of sports, and due to the geographic distance between the two (their campuses are separated by about 2580 miles and are on opposite coasts of the United States). In 2005, Caltech students pranked MIT's Campus Preview Weekend by distributing t-shirts that read \"MIT\" on the front, and \"...because not everyone can go to Caltech\" on the back. Additionally, the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the exterior of the Lobby 7 dome was covered with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology\". In 2006, MIT retaliated by posing as contractors and stealing the",

The University of Virginia women's cross country team won the 1981 and 1982 NCAA Women's Division I Cross Country Championship as well as the DI Indoor Championships. The women's swimming and diving team won its first NCAA Championship in 2021. The women repeated the feat in both 2022 and 2023. Rivalries Official ACC designated rivalry games include the Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry and the Virginia– Louisville series. These two rivalries are guaranteed an annual game in all sports, and a home-and-away series in men's and women's basketball. The Cavaliers competed against the Hokies in the Commonwealth Challenge and more recently competed in the Commonwealth Clash , under new rules, for many sports in which they compete head-to-head. The Cavaliers went 2–0 against the Hokies in the Challenge and 3–2 in the Clash (5–2 overall). Perhaps the two most significant rivalry games played between the Cavaliers and Hokies were both in men's basketball, in March 2007 and January 2019. In the former, the two teams met with identical 10–4 ACC records and the winner would clinch a share of the regular-season conference championship. UVA won the game 69–56 and took their fifth of 11 ACC titles. In the latter, No. 4 UVA beat No. 9 Virginia Tech 81–59 in the only game between two AP Top",
