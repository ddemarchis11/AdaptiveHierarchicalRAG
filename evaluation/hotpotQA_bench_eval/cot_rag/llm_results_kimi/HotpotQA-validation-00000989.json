One movie is a no-holds-barred spoof of a Tony Little - or Susan Powter -style fitness merchant [...] The other movie is a conventional family comedy that pokes lighthearted fun at the chubby young campers.\" In a positive review, Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote, \"Make no mistake about it, Disney's 'Heavyweights' is the best movie about calorically challenged pubescent boys at summer camp ever made.
