  "question": "Which mathematician worked with algebraic geometry instead of probability theory, Askold Khovanskii or Andrey Kolmogorov?",
  "gold_answer": "Askold Georgievich Khovanskii",
  "llm_answer": "Askold Khovanskii worked with algebraic geometry instead of probability theory.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 1.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Askold Khovanskii as the mathematician who worked with algebraic geometry instead of probability theory. This is consistent with the Retrieved Context, which details Khovanskii's contributions to algebraic geometry and related fields, while Kolmogorov is noted for his work in probability theory. The Model Answer is concise but fully accurate and grounded."
