    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Queen and I' (2012) as the series where Yoo In-na rose to fame, which is supported by the context. However, the Gold Answer specifies 'Queen In-hyun's Man,' which is the correct title of the series. The Model Answer partially aligns with the Gold Answer but uses an alternate title, leading to partial correctness and evidence coverage."
