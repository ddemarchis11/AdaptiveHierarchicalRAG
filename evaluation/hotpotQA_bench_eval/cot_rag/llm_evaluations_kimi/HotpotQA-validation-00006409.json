    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the context does not mention the name of the book adapted into 'The Deal.' The context explicitly states that the literal translation of the Korean title 'Sarinuiroe' is 'Murder Request,' which is the name of the book. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and does not align with the retrieved context."
