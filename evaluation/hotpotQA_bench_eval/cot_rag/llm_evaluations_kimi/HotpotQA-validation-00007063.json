    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about the number of employees at the University of Copenhagen. However, it fails to answer the question using external knowledge, which is necessary to provide the correct answer of 9,000 employees. The answer is faithful to the context but does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
