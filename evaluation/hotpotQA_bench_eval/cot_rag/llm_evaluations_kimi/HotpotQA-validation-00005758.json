  "question": "What city is the women's Vans Triple Crown of Surfing event hosted at?",
  "gold_answer": "City and County of Honolulu",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence does not specify a single city for the women’s Vans Triple Crown of Surfing event; it only lists the three venue locations—Haleiwa, Sunset, and Pipeline—on the North Shore of Oahu.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not specify a single city for the event, while the Gold Answer clearly identifies the City and County of Honolulu as the host. The Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, which mentions the North Shore of Oahu and specific venues, but it fails to align with the Gold Answer and misses the key fact about Honolulu being the host city."
