    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the evidence does not mention an actress starring in 'Innocence,' which is incorrect. The Gold Answer identifies Stephanie Caroline March as the actress, and the context supports this by detailing her career and roles, including her portrayal of Alexandra Cabot. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information despite the context being sufficient to answer the question."
