  "gold_answer": "the northwest tip of Canisteo Peninsula in Amundsen Sea",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the Lindsey Islands as being named after the professor but does not specify their location, which is the northwest tip of Canisteo Peninsula in Amundsen Sea as stated in the Gold Answer. The retrieved context mentions the Lindsey Islands but does not provide their location, making the Model Answer partially correct and partially grounded. It also fails to cover the specific location mentioned in the Gold Answer."
