    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not specify the radio station serving Belknap County, while the context clearly mentions WANH as serving the Lakes Region, which includes all of Belknap County. The Model Answer is faithful to the context in its claim but fails to provide the correct answer and misses the key fact from the Gold Answer."
