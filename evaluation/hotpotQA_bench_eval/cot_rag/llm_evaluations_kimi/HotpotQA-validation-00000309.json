    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the context only supports 'This Is Elvis' as a documentary, but it fails to address the question fully by not confirming whether 'Staten Island Catapult' is a documentary. The Gold Answer states 'yes' for both, but the Model Answer does not provide information about 'Staten Island Catapult,' which is missing from the retrieved context."
