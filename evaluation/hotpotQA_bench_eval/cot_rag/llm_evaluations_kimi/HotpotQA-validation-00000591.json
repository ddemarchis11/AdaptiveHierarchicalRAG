    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Quantrill's Raiders as the group of Civil War rangers central to the film 'Red Mountain,' which aligns with the Gold Answer's 'pro-Confederate' description. The retrieved context explicitly mentions Quantrill's Raiders as Confederate forces stirring rebellion in the West during the Civil War, grounding the Model Answer fully in the context and covering the necessary evidence."
