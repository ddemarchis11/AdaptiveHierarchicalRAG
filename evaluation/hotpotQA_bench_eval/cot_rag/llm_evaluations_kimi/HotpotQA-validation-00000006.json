    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not mention anyone known by the stage name Aladin or Eenasul Fateh. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge, which would have identified Eenasul Fateh as the correct answer. The retrieved context is irrelevant to the question, so faithfulness is high, but correctness and evidence coverage are low."
