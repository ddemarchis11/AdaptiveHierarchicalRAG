  "question": "In the 2012-13 FC Sion they brought in Gennaro Gattuso and a player who now plays for what Scottish team?",
  "gold_answer": "Scottish Premiership club Hearts",
  "llm_answer": "Johnstone Burgh",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies that the player now plays for Hearts, a Scottish Premiership club, while the Model Answer incorrectly states Johnstone Burgh, which is a different team. The Model Answer is faithful to the context, as the retrieved context mentions Kyle Lafferty currently plays for Johnstone Burgh, but it fails to align with the Gold Answer and misses the key fact about Hearts."
