    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not mention the relocation of Yemen's capital, while the Gold Answer specifies Aden as the relocated capital. The context does mention Aden as a governorate, which aligns with the Gold Answer. The Model Answer is faithful to the context but fails to address the question correctly and misses the key fact provided in the Gold Answer."
