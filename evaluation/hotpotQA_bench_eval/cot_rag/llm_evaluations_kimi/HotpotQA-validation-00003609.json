  "question": "Are Even and Incubus known for their skill in classical music?",
  "gold_answer": "no",
  "llm_answer": "The provided evidence does not mention Even (assuming this refers to the band Incubus, as no other entity named Even is referenced) being known for skill in classical music. The evidence describes Incubus as a nu-metal/alternative rock band with no connection to classical music. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to determine if Even/Incubus is known for classical music skill.",

    "answer_correctness": 1.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that there is no evidence in the context to suggest that Even or Incubus is known for skill in classical music. It aligns with the Gold Answer ('no') and is faithful to the retrieved context, which describes Incubus as a nu-metal/alternative rock band without any mention of classical music. The Model Answer also provides a clear reasoning based on the context, ensuring full evidence coverage."
