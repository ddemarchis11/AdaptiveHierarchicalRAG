    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the evidence does not specify any North Carolina native for whom Danja produced songs, which is incorrect as the Gold Answer identifies J. Cole as the North Carolina native. The retrieved context does not explicitly mention J. Cole, so the Model Answer is faithful to the context but fails to provide the correct answer or cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
