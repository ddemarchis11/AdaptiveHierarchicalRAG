    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not specify the episode in which Mona Penelope Simpson died. However, it fails to provide the correct answer, 'Mona Leaves-a,' which is the Gold Answer. The retrieved context does not contain information about Mona's death, so the Model Answer is faithful to the context but does not meet the correctness or evidence coverage criteria."
