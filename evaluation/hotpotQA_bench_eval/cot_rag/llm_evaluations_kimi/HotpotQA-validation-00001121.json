    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly addresses Louisa Adams instead of Melania Trump, who is the second First Lady born outside the United States. The Gold Answer specifies that Melania Trump was a fashion model before marrying, which is supported by the retrieved context. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and is not grounded in the context."
