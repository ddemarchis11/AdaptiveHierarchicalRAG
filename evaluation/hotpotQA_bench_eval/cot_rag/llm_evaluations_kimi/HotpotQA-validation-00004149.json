    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not specify the day of the race, while the Gold Answer ('Saturday') is correct and supported by the context. The context mentions that the Kentucky Derby, which ESPN covers, is held on the first Saturday in May. Thus, the Model Answer fails to provide the correct response and misses the key fact from the Gold Answer."
