    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the specific theatre occupied by the Admiral's Men in the 1590s, the Rose Theatre, which is supported by the retrieved context. However, it does not explicitly mention 'Elizabethan theatre,' which is the broader category stated in the Gold Answer. While the specific detail is accurate, it misses the general classification provided in the Gold Answer."
