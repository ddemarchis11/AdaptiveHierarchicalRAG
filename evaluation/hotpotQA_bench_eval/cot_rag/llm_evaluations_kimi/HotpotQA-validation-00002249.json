    "answer_correctness": 1.0,

    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Afro-Cuban communities as the ethnic group among whom Santería developed, which aligns with the context. However, it does not explicitly mention 'West African descendants,' which is a key fact from the Gold Answer. The answer is faithful to the retrieved context, as it accurately reflects the information provided about Santería's origins."
