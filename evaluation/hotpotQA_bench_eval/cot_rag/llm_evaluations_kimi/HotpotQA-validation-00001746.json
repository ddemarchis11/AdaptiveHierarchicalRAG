  "question": "Crash is similar to what 16th century British card game in the sense that there is no betting?",
  "gold_answer": "In Crash, there is no betting, as in Brag",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence does not name any 16th-century British card game that, like Crash, is played without betting.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not name a 16th-century British card game similar to Crash in terms of no betting. The context explicitly mentions Brag as a game without betting, which is also referenced in the Gold Answer. The Model Answer fails to address this and contradicts the retrieved context."
