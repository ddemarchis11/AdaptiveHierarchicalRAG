The lake is composed of two bodies of water, connected by a shallow channel known locally as the Bosporus. The two parts are referred to as Middle Waterton Lake, and Upper Waterton Lake, the latter of which is divided by the Canada–United States border , with Canada containing about two thirds of the lake, while the southern third falls in the United States. The Boundary Commission Trail ends at the lake as the last border marker was placed there on 8 August 1874. The United States Geological Survey gives the geocoordinates of 49°03′00″N 113°54′03″W ﻿ / ﻿ 49.05000°N 113.90083°W ﻿ / 49.05000; -113.90083 for Upper Waterton Lake.

The northern, lower end of the main lake lies in Waterton Lakes National Park , while the upper, southern part of the lake is located in Glacier National Park . In 1979, UNESCO established the Waterton Biosphere Reserve to protect the diverse habitats including prairie grasslands , aspen parkland , subalpine forests, alpine tundra and freshwater fens that surround the lake.",

' Pickle ' ) is a lake located in Soura in the Srinagar district of the Indian -administered Jammu and Kashmir . Situated close to Ganderbal , the lake is connected with the famous Dal Lake via a channel, \"Amir Khan Nallah,\" which passes through Gilsar and Khushal Sar . The lake is in a highly deteriorated condition. In case of flooding, the excessive water of the Dal is diverted here. The Shallabugh Wetland is fed by water from the Sind River and Anchar Lake. Deterioration Once a popular tourist destination, as tourists on shikaras and houseboats used to travel here from Dal Lake, over the years it has deteriorated owing to pollution , large-scale encroachment , and illegal constructions in its surroundings. In the 1990s, when the Nallah Mar was covered to build the Mearplan highway around the western side of Dal, six-foot pipes were laid under the new road to allow Dal to continue to drain into the Anchar lake system, however, the pipes soon clogged due to waste and debris. Like the Dal Lake and Wular Lake , it is home to the Hanji community, which lives near the lake",
