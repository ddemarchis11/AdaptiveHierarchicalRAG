The documentary explores the history of the mile and a half long stretch of road through West Hollywood known as Sunset Strip . It premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival . Synopsis Film portal United States portal The film begins with a poem recited by Mark Mahoney, and utilizes several celebrities to discuss the history of the Sunset Strip. The Sunset Strip was born during the Roaring Twenties as a dirt road connecting Hollywood's big studios to the new development known as Beverly Hills . The so-called strip was just outside of the city, and LAPD's jurisdiction, which provided the ideal environment for speakeasies, brothels, and crime of every level, but also led to much creativity. Using the stars who worked and found success there, this film explores the stories that make up the history of the Sunset Strip. Much of the time spent is on the 1950-1970s era, but the film touches upon major events such as the Golden Age of Hollywood at Ciro's and the Trocadero , The Doors playing at the Whiskey-A-Go-Go and The Roxy , legends about Mickey Cohen , and the multiple influential rock artists who called that part of the city home. Production Tommy Alastra Productions began shooting in 2010. The film features so-called \"guerilla footage\" (amateur shots, often from the crowd's perspective) of",

The clubs on the Sunset Strip such as the Whisky a Go Go and The Roxy, became home to numerous LA-based heavy metal bands such as Van Halen , Quiet Riot , Mötley Crüe , Razor Fury, Ratt and Guns N' Roses . The scene became synonymous with glam metal , with many fans mimicking the hair and clothing worn by the bands. The many heavy metal fans who would congregate outside the clubs along the strip became a defining feature. The adoption of \"pay to play\" policies, in which bands were charged a fee to play at clubs, diminished its appeal to groups, other than as an industry showcase. As of the 2010s, the music industry establishment continues to dominate the clubs on Sunset Strip.  In November 1984, voters in West Hollywood passed a proposal on the ballot to incorporate, and the area became an independent city. Increasingly, the western end of Sunset Strip was occupied by office buildings, mostly catering to the entertainment industry, as well as hotels. 1990s During the 1990s, the center of the alternative music activity in Los Angeles shifted further east",
