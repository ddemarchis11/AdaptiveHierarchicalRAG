It was revealed at E3 2013 with Tom Clancy's The Division , the first game using the engine. Snowdrop is one of the primary game engines used by Ubisoft along with Disrupt , Dunia , and Ubisoft Anvil . History The engine is coded mainly in C++ . Rodrigo Cortes, former brand art director at Massive Entertainment , said that development on the Snowdrop engine started in 2009. Initially it was an engine built for PC and next-gen development to \"do things better not bigger\". The core of the game engine is powered by a \"node-based system\" and the engine is a dynamic, interconnected and flexible system where developers can create their assets quickly and interact with them in ways that have never been done before. Massive created a lighting and destruction system inspired by film production techniques. Features of Snowdrop include advanced physically based rendering (PBR), procedural destruction, and a dynamic global illumination system. According to the developers, the engine was designed with three pillars: Empowerment, which allows animators, artists and designers to get their work done quicker, Real Time, which allows developers to implement and iterate quickly and Fun, a concept that applies not only to the final",

Ubisoft Annecy was also announced to be one of the co-developers of the game on 8 May 2015. On 15 May 2014, it was announced that The Division would be delayed until 2015, according to an anonymous source inside Massive Entertainment studio. The Division uses Ubisoft's new proprietary engine known as Snowdrop , which is made for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. On 9 June 2014, The Division was showcased at E3 2014 with an anticipated release for late 2015. In February 2016, Ubisoft announced that downloadable content for The Division would be timed exclusives for Xbox One. During E3 2015 , the game's final release date and a player versus player area known as the Dark Zone were revealed. Its companion app was cancelled, as the company considered that the addition of drones will bring unfairness to the competitive multiplayer mode of the game. Unlike the previous E3 demo, Long Island, and Staten Island do not appear in the game at launch, while Brooklyn only appears in the opening hours of the game as the tutorial area.

A successor to 2004's Red Dead Revolver , it is the second game in the Red Dead series. Red Dead Redemption is set during the decline of the American frontier in the year 1911. It follows John Marston , a former outlaw who, after his wife and son are taken hostage by the government in ransom for his services as a hired gun, sets out to bring three members of his former gang to justice. The narrative explores themes of the cycle of violence , masculinity , redemption , and the American Dream . The game is played from a third-person perspective . The player can freely roam in its interactive open world , a fictionalized version of the Western United States and Northern Mexico , primarily by horseback , and on foot. Gunfights emphasize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic called \"Dead Eye\" that allows players to mark multiple shooting targets on enemies in slow motion . The game uses a morality system by which the player's actions affect their character's levels of honor, fame, and how other characters respond to the player. An online multiplayer mode is included with the original release, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting. The game's development lasted over five years, and it became one of the most expensive video games ever made. Rockstar improved its proprietary game engine to increase its technological",

It followed its predecessors, id Tech 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , all of which had subsequently been published under the GNU General Public License . It was seen as a major advancement over id Tech 4 . The engine was first demonstrated at the WWDC 2007 by John D. Carmack on an eight-core computer; however, the demo used only a single core with single-threaded OpenGL implementation running on a 512 MB 7000 class Quadro video card. id Tech 5 was first used in the video game Rage , followed by Wolfenstein: The New Order , The Evil Within and Wolfenstein: The Old Blood . It was followed up by id Tech 6 . Features The initial demonstration of the engine featured 20 GB of texture data (using a more advanced MegaTexture approach called Virtual Texturing , which supports textures with resolutions up to 128,000 × 128,000 pixels), and a completely dynamic and changeable world. This technique allows the engine to automatically stream textures into memory as needed, meaning that developers need not concern themselves with memory restraints or texture limits. This has the advantage of simplifying the creation of content, by eliminating the need to adapt content for different platforms. The engine automatically optimizes resources for cross-platform development, making it possible to render the same models on different platforms, while creating them for only one platform, further simplifying cross-platform",

An improved version of the engine was used for Tom Clancy's The Division 2 . In February 2016, Massive confirmed that the engine can be used for other Ubisoft games. According to Martin Hultberg, head of IP at Ubisoft Massive, Snowdrop became available to all Ubisoft studios and not just those working on the Tom Clancy's IP. These games include South Park: The Fractured but Whole , Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle , and Starlink: Battle for Atlas . In June 2021, Ubisoft confirmed that the engine will be upgraded for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora . According to senior technical artist Kunal Luthra, thousands of assets can be propagated inside of each frame to create more highly detailed environments. The engine would also support real-time ray tracing, unified volumetric rendering, as well as improved AI behavior for NPCs . Snowdrop was used for Star Wars Outlaws , which features RTX Direct Illumination and DLSS Ray Reconstruction. Massive developed its own digital \"camera lens\" in Snowdrop, which was used to give the game a more cinematic presentation as an option. The remake of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell will also use Snowdrop. Ubisoft announced they will continue to upscale and develop the engine. Games using Snowdrop",
