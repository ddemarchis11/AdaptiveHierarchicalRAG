      "text": "Allen Klein (December 18, 1931 – July 4, 2009) was an American businessman whose aggressive negotiation tactics affected industry standards for compensating recording artists. He founded ABKCO Music & Records Incorporated . Klein increased profits for his musician clients by negotiating new record company contracts. He first scored monetary and contractual gains for Buddy Knox and Jimmy Bowen , one-hit rockabillies of the late 1950s, then parlayed his early successes into a position managing Sam Cooke , and eventually managed the Beatles and the Rolling Stones simultaneously, along with many other artists, becoming one of the most powerful individuals in the music industry during his era. Rather than offering financial advice and maximizing his clients' income as a business manager normally would, Klein set up what he called \"buy/sell agreements\" where a company that Klein owned became an intermediary between his client and the record label, owning the rights to the music, manufacturing the records, selling them to the record label, and paying royalties and cash advances to the client. Although Klein greatly increased his clients' incomes, he also enriched himself, sometimes without his clients' knowledge. The Rolling Stones' $1.25 million advance from the Decca Records label in 1965, for example, was deposited into a company that Klein had established, and the fine print of the contract did not require Klein to release it for 20 years. Klein's involvement with both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones would lead to years of litigation",

Walewander invited the band to Tiger Stadium to see a game in which he hit his first and only major league home run. In 1988, they issued Beelzebubba , a comparatively polished record that yielded their most successful single, \" Punk Rock Girl \". Featuring Genaro on lead vocals, the track saw extensive rotation on MTV and propelled the album to number 101 on Billboard 's Top 200. They later released the Smokin' Banana Peels EP and music video from this album. The 1990 followup, Metaphysical Graffiti , did not yield a hit, but also charted and helped solidify the group's presence in the independent rock scene. Stint with Hollywood Records; breakup (1991–95) In 1991, the band left Restless and signed with The Walt Disney Company -owned Hollywood Records . Soul Rotation , their Hollywood debut released the following year, was focused more heavily on Genaro's singing and songwriting, with Linderman used predominantly as a keyboardist. The resulting record was much more pop -oriented than the group's previous efforts, but failed to produce a hit single. Not Richard, But Dick was issued in 1993, and did not fare any better than its predecessor. Relations between the band and label quickly soured, and",

      "text": "More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies) is a compilation album by The Rolling Stones released in December 1972 on London Records . The album was a follow-up to the successful Hot Rocks 1964–1971 . When Hot Rocks proved to be a big seller, there was never any doubt that a successor would follow. However, initially—with Andrew Loog Oldham getting involved—the project was to feature previously unreleased (or more accurately, discarded) material and be titled Necrophilia . Artwork was prepared and the album made it as far as the mastering phase when it was recalled and something a little more practical was compiled (ABKCO would revisit this concept with 1975's Metamorphosis ). The result was More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies) . This was the second \"post-contract\" compilation released under the aegis of London/ ABKCO Records after the termination of the Stones relationship with ABKCO and Decca Records . Because of the nature of the contract, the Rolling Stones lost all control over their pre-1971 recordings and this album was released without their input or consent. ABKCO and Decca would continue to release such un-authorized albums over the next several decades. Release and reception Featuring the hits that could not be shoehorned onto its predecessor, as well as first-time release of many previously UK-only releases, the double album was quickly pressed and distributed into North American shops in December",

The template for the label was established in the 2016 Black Queen's debut record, Fever Daydream , where Puciato set about developing every aspect of the album by themselves (i.e. him, his bandmates Alexander and Eustis, and Draxler), both musically and non-musically, tackling record pressings, merchandise, managing, etc. The Independent commented that the enterprise involved \"a wealth of difficulties\", stating that \"they could have easily secured label funding considering the associations that each member has with established bands\", yet Puciato saw it as rewarding because in the end they did not \"corrupt\" any aspect of the band, in particular its aesthetic, which \"is on everything [the album] touches [from the creative end to the release end].\" When Fever Daydream was released, the singer was initially against the use of a moniker but later changed his mind after discussing the logistics with Draxler.",
