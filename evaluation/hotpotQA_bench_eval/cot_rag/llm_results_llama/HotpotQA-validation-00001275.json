      "text": "in the city. Legacy Compilations In 1988, EMI Records (after constant pressure from Malcolm Jones) made an album of Barrett's studio out-takes and unreleased material recorded from 1968 to 1970 under the title Opel . The disc was originally set to include the unreleased Barrett Pink Floyd songs \"Scream Thy Last Scream\" and \"Vegetable Man\", which had been remixed for the album by Jones, but the band pulled the two songs before Opel was finalised. In 1993, EMI issued Crazy Diamond , a boxed set of all three albums, each with further out-takes from his solo sessions that illustrated Barrett's inability or refusal to play a song the same way twice. EMI also released The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn't You Miss Me? in the UK on 16 April 2001 and in the US on 11 September 2001. It was the first official release of his song \" Bob Dylan Blues \", taken from a demo tape that Gilmour had kept after an early 1970s session. The tape also contains the unreleased \"Living Alone\" from the Barrett sessions. In October 2010, Harvest/EMI and Capitol Records released An Introduction to Syd Barrett , a collection of his Pink Floyd and remastered solo work. The 2010 compilation An Introduction to Syd Barrett includes the downloadable bonus track \"Rhamadan\", a 20-minute track",
