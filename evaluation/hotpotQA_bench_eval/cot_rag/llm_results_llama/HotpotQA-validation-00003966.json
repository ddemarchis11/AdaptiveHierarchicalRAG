Team Doctor Charles Burke won cups with Pittsburgh in 1991 and 1992, but his name was left off the Stanley Cup. 1992 Pittsburgh Penguins filled the last spot on the shoulder of the Stanley Cup. No winning team name since has been added to the Stanley Cup shoulder. Since the last larger ring was filled in 1991. The NHL decided to remove the top ring with winning teams from 1927–28 to 1939–40 and retire it to the Hockey Hall of Fame. A new blank ring was added at the bottom to include the 1992 Pittsburgh Penguins team members. NHL decided to keep the Stanley Cup the same size and shape 34 1/2 inches tall and 35 1/2 pounds. This way the cup does not get too big, and it remains the same size/shape that hockey fans are used to. It also encourages more fans to go to Toronto and see all the names on the retired rings at the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Officially, owner Leo Dandurand was the Manager of the Montreal Canadiens from 1921–22 to 1934–35. However, Cecil Hart was engraved on the Stanley Cup in 1930 and 1931, and he is listed on every team picture for those seasons as Manager. Leo Dandurand would later get his name on the Grey Cup as the President (owner) of Montreal Allouettes in 1949 . This made Leo Dandurand the 4th person to win both the Stanley Cup and Grey Cup. (See Joe Miller , Lionel Conacher , Carl Voss , Harold Ballard , Norman Kwong & Wayne Gretzky other persons who won both the Grey Cup and Stanley Cup.) Hilarion A. \"Louis\" Letourneau (Owner/Director) gave up position on Board of Directors of the Montreal Canadiens after the 1930 Stanley Cup. He would sell his shares in 1932.

The deal keeps the Penguins in Pittsburgh for at least 30 years. Lemieux was instrumental in negotiating this deal, despite outside efforts to move the team to Kansas City . It was later revealed that Lemieux did visit Kansas City only to put pressure on the city and state to push through plans for the new arena. The Penguins returned to the playoffs, losing in five games to the Ottawa Senators in 2007, and making the Finals in 2008 where they lost in six games to the Detroit Red Wings . On June 12, 2009, Lemieux won his third Stanley Cup title, this time as an owner as the Penguins won a rematch with the Red Wings in the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals , in seven games. In 2015, Lemieux and Ron Burkle hired Morgan Stanley to explore the possibility of selling the Penguins. On June 12, 2016, the Penguins defeated the San Jose Sharks in the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals , in six games, to give Lemieux his fourth Stanley Cup, his second as an owner.
