He attended Isidore Newman School and then received B.A. , M.B.A. , and J.D. degrees from Tulane University , where he was a member of honorary societies Phi Beta Kappa and the Order of the Coif . While pursuing his legal career, he also managed the Cold , a popular new wave band in New Orleans. In 1997, Spizer earned a large legal fee from the settlement of a class action lawsuit, and decided to use some of the money to replace his childhood collection of Beatles LPs (which had been damaged by cockroaches ) with a new set of first edition albums. Drawn into the world of Beatles collectors , he ended up writing and self-publishing The Beatles Records on Vee-Jay , about the relationship between EMI , the Beatles' U.K. record label, and Vee-Jay Records , the U.S. label that released the band's first records in the U.S. As of 2020, Spizer has written and published twelve books about the Beatles.

      "text": "the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ...\" The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as \"an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism\" and \"the first advance in popular music since the War\". In 1964, the Beatles' arrival in the US is credited with initiating the album era ; the music historian Joel Whitburn says that LP sales soon \"exploded and eventually outpaced the sales and releases of singles\" in the music industry. They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz , the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley , and later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee . The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people whom they most associated with UK culture. Their musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs . On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio.

In 2016, Reynolds described it as \"Prince's '80s evasion of conventional gender definitions speaks to us now in this trans-aware moment. But it also harks backwards in time to the origins of rock 'n' roll in racial mixture and sexual blurring\". Prince was known for the strong female presence in his bands and his support for women in the music industry throughout his career. Slate said he worked with an \"astounding range of female stars\" and \"promised a world where men and women looked and acted like each other\". Prince also wore high-heeled shoes and boots both on and off-stage. Rolling Stone ranked Prince at No. 27 on its list of 100 Greatest Artists, \"the most influential artists of the rock & roll era\". In 2023, the same magazine ranked him at No. 16 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. In 2010, Prince was ranked number 7 on VH1 's \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".
