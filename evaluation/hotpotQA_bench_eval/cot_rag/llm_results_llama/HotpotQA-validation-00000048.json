      "text": "Silene menziesii is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae known by the common names Menzies' campion and Menzies' catchfly . It is native to western North America from Alaska through the western half of Canada to the southwestern United States. It can be found in many types of habitat and it is quite common in much of its range. It is variable in morphology and there are a number of varied subtaxa. In general, it is a perennial herb growing from a caudex , appearing matlike, decumbent, or erect, with stems a few centimeters to over half a meter long. It is usually hairy in texture, with upper parts bearing sticky glandular hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, oppositely arranged in pairs, and a few centimeters in length, upper leaves usually smaller than lower. Flowers may occur in a cyme at the top of the stem, or in leaf axils, or both. Each is encapsulated in a hairy, veined calyx of fused sepals . The petals are white with two lobes at the tips. The plant is dioecious with male and female plants producing different flowers. The male and female flower types look the same externally; the stamens are reduced in female plants and the stigmas are reduced in the male.

Etymology Silene is the feminine form of Silenus , an Ancient Greek woodland deity who was a companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus . Species Ecology Lychnis is also the common name of Hadena bicruris , a species of noctuid moth . The larva of this moth feeds on Silene (formerly Lychnis ) species, as do some other Lepidoptera including cabbage moths (recorded on Silene chalcedonica ), grey chi and case-bearers of the genus Coleophora including C. albella (feeds exclusively on Silene flos-cuculi ). Uses Many species of Silene are in cultivation for perennial gardens. Some have gained the Royal Horticultural Society 's Award of Garden Merit , including Silene flos-jovis and Silene schafta . Silene undulata (syn. S. capensis ) is known as iindlela zimhlophe (\"white paths\") by the Xhosa of South Africa . A Xhosa diviner identifies and collects the plant from the wild. The roots are ground, mixed with water, and beaten to a froth, which is consumed by novice diviners during the full moon to influence their dreams . They also take it to prepare for various rituals. The root has such a strong, musky essence that the diviners who consume it",

      "text": "in spots where depressions have formed and can hold water for some period of time. Adaptations Ferocactus have very shallow root systems and are easily uprooted during flash floods. The \"fishhook\" spines and the armored web of spines enclosing the cactus body in many species of this genus are adaptations which allow the plant to move to more favorable locations. The seeds germinate in areas where water movement occurs or in areas where standing water accumulates for some period of time, and during flash floods , the hooked spines allow the plants to be caught on waterborne debris, uprooted and carried to areas where water tends to accumulate. Cultivation In cultivation Ferocactus require full sun, little water, and good drainage. They are popular as houseplants . They cannot tolerate freezing temperatures for extended periods, which typically cause them to yellow, bleach, then slowly die. Propagation is usually from seeds, but clustering species such as Ferocactus robustus and F. glaucescens can be propagated by removing a rooted offset and planting it. Ecology Many ferocactus species are ant plants , exuding nectar along the upper meristem from extrafloral nectaries above each areole, and hosting ant colonies.

      "text": "Silene stenophylla is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae . Commonly called narrow-leafed campion , it is a species in the genus Silene . It grows in the Arctic tundra of far eastern Siberia and the mountains of northern Japan. Frozen samples, estimated via radiocarbon dating to be around 32,000 years old, were discovered in the same area as current living specimens and, in 2012, a team of scientists successfully regenerated a plant from the samples. Habitat and description Silene stenophylla grows in the Arctic tundra of far eastern Siberia and the mountains of northern Japan. It is typically 5–25 cm (2–10 in) tall, has narrow leaves, and a large calyx . It blooms during the summer and has incised petals that are lilac, light pink, or white in color. It is a perennial that grows on stony cliffs and sandy shores. S. stenophylla is one of a few Beringian plant species that did not establish itself in North America. Etymology The specific epithet is derived from the Greek stenos (narrow) and phyllon (leaf) to give \"narrow-leaved\". Recovery of frozen remains A team of scientists from Russia, Hungary and the United States recovered frozen Silene stenophylla seeds and remains from the Pleistocene in 2007, while investigating about",

      "text": "Silene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae . Containing nearly 900 species, it is the largest genus in the family. Common names include campion and catchfly . Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Scientific history Members of this genus have been the subject of research by preeminent plant ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists, including Charles Darwin , Gregor Mendel , Carl Correns , Herbert G. Baker , and Janis Antonovics . Many Silene species continue to be widely used to study systems, particularly in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. The genus has been used as a model for understanding the genetics of sex determination for over a century. Silene species commonly contain a mixture of hermaphroditic and female (or male-sterile) individuals ( gynodioecy ), and early studies by Correns showed that male sterility could be maternally inherited, an example of what is now known as cytoplasmic male sterility . Two independent groups of species in Silene have evolved separate male and female sexes ( dioecy ) with chromosomal sex determination that is analogous to the system found in humans and other mammals. Silene flowers are frequently visited by flies, such as Rhingia campestris . Silene species have also been used to study speciation, host-pathogen interactions, biological species invasions, adaptation to",
