      "text": ", malunga (derivations of the African musical bow) or the Appalachian mouth-bow . Playing ways The usual way to make the bow sound is to pluck the string, although sometimes a subsidiary bow is used to scrape the string, much as on a violin . The Onavillu of Kerala sounds when struck with a thin stick. Unlike string instruments used in classical music , however, they do not have a built-in resonator, although resonators may be made to work with the bow in a number of ways. The most usual type of resonator consists of a gourd attached to the back of the string bearer. The bow may also be stood in a pit or gourd on the ground, or one end of it may be partially placed in the mouth. This last method allows the size of the resonator to be varied as the instrument is played, thus allowing a melody to be heard consisting of the notes resonating in the player's mouth. As well as these various forms of resonators, the bow is frequently played without a resonator at all. In Africa, the musical bow is usually played by a solo performer. In capoeira , the berimbau is played as part of the roda, a musical group standing in a circle, in the centre of which the capoeiristas perform or play. The Appalachian mouth-bow can be played amplified in old-time music jams. In Africa See : Uhadi musical bow See : Umuduri The",

Henri Breuil surveyed the Trois Frères in France caves and made an engraving that attempted to reproduce a c. 13,000 B.C. cave painting into a black-and-white lithograph engraving. His engraving showed a mysterious figure, a \"man camouflaged to resemble a bison,\" in the midst of a mass of herd-animals, \"herding the beasts and playing the musical bow.\" The artwork is confused, and those who are trying to reproduce the art in color have had to work to bring out legible images. One interpretation of the \"magician-hunter\" image considers his hunting-bow to be a musical bow, used as a single-stringed musical instrument. Whether the bow in the cave illustration is a musical instrument or the hunting tool in a Paleolithic hunt, musicologists have considered whether the bow could be a possible relative or ancestor to the chordophone : the lute , lyre , harp , and zither family. Curt Sachs said that there was good reason not to consider hunters' bows as likely musical bows. One reason was that the oldest known musical bows were 10 feet long, useless for hunting, and that \"musical bows were not associated with hunters' beliefs and ceremonies.\" Sachs considered the musical bows important, however.",

Problems playing this file? See media help . The musical bow ( bowstring or string bow , a subset of bar zithers ) is a simple string instrument used by a number of African peoples as well as Indigenous peoples of the Americas. It consists of a flexible, usually wooden, stick 1.5 to 10 feet (0.5 to 3 m) long, and strung end to end with a taut cord, usually metal. It can be played with the hands or a wooden stick or branch. It is uncertain if the musical bow developed from the hunting bow , though the San or Bushmen people of the Kalahari Desert do convert their hunting bows to musical use. Types of bow include mouth-resonated string bow, earth-resonated string bow , and gourd-resonated string bow. History India, ca. 1725, Bundi style.

In the Caribbean, on the island of Curaçao , the benta is a one-stringed musical bow, played using the mouth as a resonating chamber. Most probably brought to the island by Africans from Ghana, Angola, Nigeria during the slave trade, it is played as a leading instrument in \"muzik di zumbi\", ghost music (zumbi means ghost). The name refers to the spooky atmosphere on the plantations since there was no electricity, and the hauling wind carries the sound of the music in all directions. It is mostly accompanied by drum, hoe and \"wiri\" (scraper of a serrated piece of iron).

The Umuduri musical bow used in Burundi and Rwanda is similar to the Uhadi bow of South Africa. Two bows in which the resonator is a gourd, attached to the instrument's center and pressed into the musician's chest or stomach. Both are sounded with a stick. Due to the nature of their construction and playing, musical bows are quiet instruments, therefore needing a resonator to resound. The resonator can either be a gourd (as in uhadi , umakhweyana , segankure , xitende , berimbau , etc.) or the player's mouth (as in umrhubhe , umqangala , tshihwana , xizambi , etc.) Musical bows are the main instruments of the Nguni and Sotho people, the predominant peoples of South Africa. Historians believe that many of the musical bows came from Khoisan peoples. Although there are many differences between musical bows, all of them share two things: a resonator, and at least two fundamental notes. The strongest notes are the fundamentals , the deepest notes produced by the string, whereas the higher notes (the harmonic partials ) are produced by the resonator. There are at least two fundamental notes",
