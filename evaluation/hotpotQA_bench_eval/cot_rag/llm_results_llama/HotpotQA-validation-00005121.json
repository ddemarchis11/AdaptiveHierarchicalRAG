According to the original sleeve notes, all the songs have a \"common geographical root: the American South.\" In 1963, Capitol Records re-released Swingin' Down Yonder under the titled Southern Style . The 1991 Capitol Records CD reissue added eight bonus tracks which for the most part uphold the Dixieland sound. By contrast, the 2005 Collectors' Choice reissue selected four bonus tracks of dubious connection to the American South, including \"Under the Bridges of Paris\".

      "text": "Dean Martin Sings is the first studio album by Italian-American singer Dean Martin , released in 1953. It is the first long-play 10-inch album recorded by Martin for Capitol Records during two sessions recorded on the evening of November 20, 1952. The first session was recorded between 5 and 8 PM and it produced five songs featuring string arrangements. \"There's My Lover\" was recorded but not released. After a 90-minute break, Martin was joined by a brass arrangement to record the remaining four songs. Seven of the eight songs on this album appeared in the Martin & Lewis film, The Stooge . Two years later, the songs from this 10-inch album would be combined with four newly popular songs recorded between 1951 and 1953 to create a full-length 12-inch album. The 2005 Collectors' Choice reissue added four bonus songs recorded between 1949 and 1953 and was released with alternative cover artwork.
