The building, constructed in 1901, served as the town hall, billing centre, court, council chamber, fire station, police office, and jailhouse, before roughly 1989, when it was vacated and fell into disrepair as Glace Bay had joined the Cape Breton Regional Municipality . Starting in 1998, former teacher and sportsman Howard MacKinnon (1928–2019) and RCAF veteran and ex-Deputy Mayor Inglis MacAulay (1923–2017) formed the non-profit Glace Bay Heritage Museum Society in a bid to preserve the building as a cultural landmark; at the time, demolition of the site was being planned. Initial preparations were finished five years later in 2003, with most of the functions of the building now overseen by German-Canadian curator Elke Ibrahim. The second floor, including a sports and entertainment exhibit, was finalized in 2010. The town's memorial to its deceased coal miners is located on the museum grounds.

The museum is owned and operated by the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum . It opened on May 14, 2005, with Julia Ruth Stevens, the daughter of celebrated baseball player Babe Ruth , in attendance. The 22,000-square-foot (2,044 m 2 ) museum, housed in the former Camden Station , was adjacent to the main gate of Oriole Park at Camden Yards and had artifacts and interactive exhibits profiling Maryland's sports history. Exhibits included such area teams as the Baltimore Orioles , Baltimore Ravens , Baltimore Colts , Maryland Terrapins , Baltimore Elite Giants , Baltimore Black Sox , and the Baltimore Blast . A replica of the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Super Bowl V was part of the museum's collection. The original trophy from the Colts' 1971 Super Bowl victory was taken by former owner Carroll Rosenbloom after he traded the Colts for the Los Angeles Rams in 1972. A replica trophy was later made for the Colts, but in the Midnight Move of 1984 , the team was not allowed to keep the trophy. That trophy stayed in the city of Baltimore's possession, and was placed in the Sports Legends Museum. After ten years of operation the museum closed abruptly on October 12, 2015, after failing to reach an agreement with the Maryland Stadium Authority for the continued use",
