      "text": "The Palace of Westminster , after which the Westminster system is named. It is the home of the UK Parliament . The Westminster system , or Westminster model , is a type of parliamentary government modelled on that of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Key aspects of the system include an executive branch made up of members of the legislature which is responsible to the legislature, the presence of parliamentary opposition parties, and a ceremonial head of state who is separate from the head of government . The term derives from the Palace of Westminster , the seat of the British parliament. The Westminster system can be contrasted with the presidential system , which originated in the United States , and with the semi-presidential system based on the government of France . The Westminster system is used, or was once used, in the national and subnational legislatures of most former colonies of the British Empire upon gaining self-government , beginning with the Province of Canada in 1848. However, many former colonies have since adopted other forms of government. Characteristics The Westminster system of government may include some of the following features: A sovereign or head of state who functions as the nominal or legal and constitutional holder of executive power, and holds numerous reserve powers , but whose daily duties mainly consist of performing ceremonial functions. Examples include King Charles III , the governors-general in the Commonwealth realms , or the presidents of many countries, and state or provincial governors in federal systems . Exceptions to this are Ireland and Israel , whose presidents are both de jure and de facto ceremonial, and",

Current countries Countries that use variations on the theme of the Westminster system, as of 2023, include the following: Former countries The Westminster system was adopted by a number of countries which subsequently evolved or reformed their system of government departing from the original model. In some cases, certain aspects of the Westminster system were retained or codified in their constitutions. For instance South Africa and Botswana , unlike Commonwealth realms or parliamentary republics such as India, have a combined head of state and head of government but the President remains responsible to the lower house of parliament; it elects the President at the beginning of a new Parliament, or when there is a vacancy in the office, or when the sitting President is defeated on a vote of confidence. If the Parliament cannot elect a new President within a short period of time (a week to a month) the lower house is dissolved and new elections are called.

The two dominant political parties in Canada have historically been the Liberal Party of Canada and the current Conservative Party of Canada (as well as its numerous predecessors ). Parties like the New Democratic Party , the Quebec nationalist Bloc Québécois and the Green Party of Canada have grown in prominence, exerting their own influence to the political process. Canada has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United States and United Kingdom, and more parliamentary votes are considered motions of confidence , which tends to diminish the role of non- Cabinet members of parliament (MPs). Such members, in the government caucus , and junior or lower-profile members of opposition caucuses, are known as backbenchers . Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the Public Accounts Committee or the National Defence Committee . Context Canada's governmental structure was originally established by the British Parliament through the British North America Act, 1867 (now the Constitution Act, 1867 ), but the federal model and division of powers were devised by Canadian politicians. Particularly after World War I, citizens of the self-governing Dominions , such as Canada, began to develop a strong sense of identity, and, in the Balfour Declaration of 1926 , the British government and the governments of the six Dominions jointly agreed that the Dominions had full autonomy within the British Commonwealth.
