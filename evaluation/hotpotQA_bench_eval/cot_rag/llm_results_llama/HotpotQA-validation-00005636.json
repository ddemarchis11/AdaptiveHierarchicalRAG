While declaring that Sleepless in Seattle remains the best romantic comedy ever released, Body+Soul contributor Hannah-Rose Yee said despite being \"the kind of movie that gives romantic comedies a bad name ... no film has come close to distilling what Sleepless in Seattle does about the ridiculous enterprise that is opening up your heart to someone else\". However, she admitted that one's ability to enjoy the film depends \"entirely on how on board you can get with a romance in which the two lead characters don't meet until the last five minutes\". The Guardian 's Luke Walpole, who had avoided watching the film until 2020 in fear that it had aged poorly, ultimately found Ephron's screenplay to be a gorgeous \"balance of melancholy and fizzing optimism\", but criticized Sleepless in Seattle' s \"narrowly middle class and privileged\" characters. Common Sense Media wrote that the film is successful in Ephron's hands, despite its \"frustrating\" structure at times. Siede noted that in recent years, Annie's actions in pursuit of Sam have been re-evaluated as what some critics perceive as stalker behavior, with Nicole Sperling of Vanity Fair feeling Annie's determination \"verges into stalker territory\". Siede defended the character, writing \"Annie's",

Asked in 2009, Bellamy said he did not hear the similarity, saying Muse were \"past [the comparisons] in most places\". Reviewing their fourth album, Black Holes and Revelations (2006), Spin, Stylus Magazine and Observer Music Monthly wrote that Muse had transcended comparisons to Radiohead. In 2006, Pitchfork described Muse's music as \"firmly ol' skool at heart: proggy hard rock that forgoes any pretensions to restraint ... their songs use full-stacked guitars and thunderous drums to evoke God's footsteps\". AllMusic described their sound as a \"fusion of progressive rock, glam , electronica, and Radiohead-influenced experimentation\". On Muse's association with progressive rock, Howard said: \"I associate [progressive rock] with 10-minute guitar solos, but I guess we kind of come into the category. A lot of bands are quite ambitious with their music, mixing lots of different styles – and when I see that I think it's great.\" The Guardian described Muse as \"fearlessly flamboyant\". Howard said he loved the \"excess\" of their music and that he liked \"pushing it as far as we can\", citing the choir of \"Survival\" as an example. Wolstenholme said: \"You can go on writing traditional pop-rock songs and get stale or",

Musical style Bellamy performing with the band in September 2019 Described as a band that fuse alternative rock , progressive rock , space rock , hard rock , art rock , electronic rock , progressive metal , indie rock and pop , Muse also mix sounds from genres such as electronica and R&B , with forms such as classical music and rock opera . In 2002, Bellamy described Muse as a \"trashy three-piece\". He said supporting the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their 1999 Californication tour inspired Muse to become less reserved and \"up their game\" in their performances. Bellamy said Lady Gaga was an influence on Muse's showmanship and stage costumes, \"crossing that line between what is fantasy and what is reality\". Early in their career, Muse were often likened to Radiohead . Spin wrote that Bellamy's voice \"often slips into high, mournful tones\" similar to the Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke . John Leckie , who produced Muse's first two albums and also produced Radiohead's second album, The Bends (1995), dismissed the comparisons, saying: \"In the late 90s, any British band that sang passionately and played guitar was going to get compared to Radiohead.\" He said he chose to produce Muse after The Bends because he \"intentionally looked for something different\".
