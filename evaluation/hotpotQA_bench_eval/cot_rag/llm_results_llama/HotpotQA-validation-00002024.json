Originally, Welch planned for the project to follow the \"Head\" name, but was persuaded otherwise so as not to be sued by the tennis equipment manufacturer of the same name. Though the project has since been dubbed \"Brian Head Welch\", the album art continues to carry the imprint of the project's original title. The project's true title does appear on the spines of the packaging. Of the album, Welch said: \"I knew it was going to be nothing near as big as Korn, but I was proud of it. It's got some heavy riffs and it's got a lot more emotion than I've ever put in music. I'm an emotional guy (and) it was cool to be able to put it in there. It was cool how people were surprised by it. A lot of people thought I was gonna come out with some 'Kumbaya,' Jesus music.\" For his live touring band, Welch held closed and open auditions to recruit members. Members posted videos online of them performing Welch's solo songs and the list was narrowed down to a few who did a personal audition with Welch. Eventually, the lineup was finalized to include Brian Ruedy (Keyboards), Scott \"SVH\" Von Heldt (guitar & backing vocals), Ralph Patlan (guitar), Michael \"Valentine\"",

When the hundred is there, I'm like, 'There's one or two people who really need us to be here,' and it should be focused on them and I shouldn't care if there's a big crowd or not, but I struggle with it. I was in Korn and we sold like 25 million albums, and I can't even fill this little bar up? Of all those fans, 300–400 people can't just show up here?

Unreleased songs According to an interview with the Great Falls Tribune , Welch returned to the studio to begin work on a second album. Concerning his career at the time, Welch said that \"I feel like I was created to do what I'm doing right now. Everything I learned in my life before I changed it all over, it set me up for what I'm doing now. That's the satisfaction. That's the peace in knowing, without a doubt, that you're on the road you're supposed to be on. There's nothing more content than that.\" In November 2009, Welch announced that his second effort would be produced by Grammy-nominee Rob Graves ( Red , Pillar ), and that the band was recording in Nashville, expecting to complete",

Star Alan Young recalled the producer-director: He was a very lovable character, but he was a character. He wanted to rush through and get things done quickly, and he didn't want to stay around the studio too long. I'll never forget one line he used. He didn't like people fooling around on the set, cracking jokes. He really didn't have a great sense of humor for a man who did so many comedies! I'll never forget when he said: \"Stop that! Stop all this laughing! This is comedy, there's no time for laughter!\" Well, we just all broke up. He didn't realize what he said, he didn't care. As a longtime friend of Mae West , Lubin got her to appear on an episode of Mister Ed . He directed the occasional feature, such as The Thief of Baghdad (1961), The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964, with Don Knotts ) and Hold On! (1966, with Herman's Hermits ). Peter Noone who appeared in the latter remembers, \"Arthur Lubin was really talented. He made us better than we actually were, which is what a good director does. I mean, this band was not exactly ready for Stanislavski.\" Lubin's last feature was Rain for a Dusty Summer (1971). His",
