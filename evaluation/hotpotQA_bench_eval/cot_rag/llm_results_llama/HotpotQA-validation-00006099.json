Operated jointly by British Caledonian Airways and British Airways Helicopters using a Sikorsky S-61 owned by the British Airports Authority , the \"curious and unique operation\" connected the rapidly growing airports in the years before the M25 motorway existed.

No similar service has operated between the airports since Airlink's cessation. Background Gatwick Airport pictured in 1972 Heathrow Airport is 12 nmi (22 km; 14 mi) west of central London, and Gatwick Airport is 24.7 nmi (45.7 km; 28.4 mi) south of the city.

They were to be used mainly on charter services to central and Eastern Europe; however, they also offered increased flexibility on the airline's scheduled flights. In July 2010, the airline named one of their BAe Jetstream 41 aircraft after the comedian Ken Dodd in celebration of the year anniversary of the start of their flights from Liverpool and Dodd's support shown in the region.
