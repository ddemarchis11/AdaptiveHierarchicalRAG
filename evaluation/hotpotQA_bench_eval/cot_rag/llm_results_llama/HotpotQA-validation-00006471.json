      "text": "\" Grow Some Funk of Your Own \" is a song by British musician Elton John . It was released as a single in 1976 from the album Rock of the Westies . It shared its A-side status with \" I Feel Like a Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford) \". The song went to No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 , but in Britain broke a five-year run of successful singles by failing to reach the top 50 despite extensive radio play. Guitarist Davey Johnstone is credited as a co-writer. Synopsis The song centers on a man who wakes up after a bad dream entailing an episode set in Mexico, where the protagonist (presumably either John or Taupin) falls for a young lady in a small town but is dismissed by her boyfriend, telling him to return to where he came from (hence the lyric, \"Take my advice/take the next flight/and grow your funk/grow your funk at home\"). Reception Cash Box called it \"a hard-driving rocker which has a part audiences will sing along to and maybe provide another encore to his live show\" with \"an absolutely frantic ending with the vibraphones receiving the beating of their lives.\" Record World said that \"Elton shows why he's on top with his 'English charm' and an enthusiastic no holds barred rock 'n' roll sound.\" Personnel Ray Cooper – castanets , tambourine, bell tree , vibraphone Kiki Dee –",

      "text": "Goin' Bananas is the fourth album by soul group Side Effect . Released in 1977 by Fantasy Records , it was produced by Wayne Henderson . Like other releases by the group, the work featured an R&B based sound greatly influenced by contemporary disco and jazz music. In terms of background, the group had endured a major line-up change as singer Helen Lowe had her role taken over by Sylvia St. James . The album embraced bananas as a gimmick. Besides the cheeky title, the cover depicts vocalist Sylvia St. James in an outfit highly reminiscent of film icon Carmen Miranda . The record company even pressed the release on yellow vinyl . Goin' Bananas ended up receiving supportive yet mixed reviews. Music critic Alex Henderson of Allmusic stated that he thought singer St. James can show \"herself to be an expressive and capable vocalist\", yet the group still appeared to fall short in comparison to their previous work. He still highlighted several tracks for praise such as \"It's All In Your Mind\" and \"Private World\", remarking on the latter's \"infectious funk\".
