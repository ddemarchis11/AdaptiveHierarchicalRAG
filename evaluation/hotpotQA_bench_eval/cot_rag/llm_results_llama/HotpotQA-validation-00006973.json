      "text": "\" Collateral Damage \" is the eleventh episode of the third season of the crime - thriller television series Millennium . It premiered on the Fox network on January 22, 1999. The episode was written by Michael R. Perry , and directed by Thomas J. Wright . \"Collateral Damage\" featured guest appearances by O'Quinn, Jacinda Barrett , James Marsters , and radio host Art Bell as himself. Bell's radio show Coast to Coast AM was among Perry's inspirations for the script. In this episode, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) and Emma Hollis ( Klea Scott ) investigate the kidnapping of the daughter of Millennium Group member Peter Watts ( Terry O'Quinn ), which may be connected to the testing of a pathogen during the Gulf War . The episode was well-received critically, with the guest acting seen as particularly strong, and was viewed by approximately 5.6 million households during its initial broadcast. Plot Leaving a bowling alley, student Taylor Watts ( Jacinda Barrett ) is abducted by two men. As she is dragged into a car, her dropped purse shows that her father is Millennium Group member Peter Watts ( Terry O'Quinn ). Watts briefs FBI agents on the kidnapping, as a witness describes one abductor, who was wearing a mask like those issued to U.S. troops in the Gulf War . FBI agent Emma Hollis ( Klea Scott ) remarks to the agents that Watts failed to mention of",

Wright would also go on to direct \" Millennium \", the series' crossover episode with its sister show The X-Files . Perry was inspired to write the episode due to his interest in conspiracy theory literature, which he finds interesting but does not believe in. The Coast to Coast AM radio show featured in the episode also served as an inspiration, and its host Art Bell agreed to appear as himself. Guest star James Marsters was cast immediately after his audition for the role of Eric Swan, and although several of Millennium 's crew were fans of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer , in which Marsters had a recurring role, Perry recalled none of them recognizing the actor during his audition due to the strength of his performance. This episode marked a change in the presentation of Black's \"flashback\" visions, a hallmark of the series. Previously they had been depicted with a series of rapid and vague images; director Wright felt that it would be beneficial to slow these down and linger on imagery for longer, \"so we could see a little more of what was happening\". Broadcast and reception \"Collateral Damage\" was first broadcast on the Fox network on January 22, 1999. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.77 during its original broadcast, meaning that 5.77 percent of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately 5.6 million households. \"Collateral Damage\" received",

With the new millennium in 2000, NBC's Later finally got another permanent host after various figures had taken the chair for several years, in the form of a VH1 personality, Cynthia Garrett, who broke the proverbial \" glass ceiling \" by becoming the first African-American female late-night host. Unfortunately, Garrett only lasted a year before NBC canceled the 12 + 1 ⁄ 2 -year-old Later in favor of reruns of the critically acclaimed cult Canadian-produced sketch comedy series, SCTV , itself a former NBC late-night program that aired Fridays between 1981 and 1983. That action, a temporary measure, was necessitated by the prolonged development of, and negotiations with a host of, a slated replacement show (see below). Many late-night talk shows went off the air in the days following the September 11 attacks of 2001, while their networks aired round-the-clock news coverage. Letterman was the first to return on September 17, addressing the situation in an opening monologue. The show was not presented in its normal jovial manner, and featured Dan Rather , Regis Philbin , and a musical performance from Tori Amos . Politically Incorrect also resumed on September 17 and immediately drew controversy due to remarks Maher and a guest (",

The Pepsodent Show , which opened each weekly episode with host Bob Hope 's rapid-fire, topical and often political observational comedy , was a particularly important predecessor to the late-night format. Early television variety shows included The Ed Sullivan Show (originally known as Toast of the Town ), which aired on CBS Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971, and Texaco Star Theater with Milton Berle , which aired on NBC from 1948 to 1956. These shows aired once a week in evening time slots that would come to be known as prime time . The first show to air in a late-night timeslot itself, Broadway Open House , aired on NBC in 1950 and ended a year later after host Jerry Lester left the show, a combination of frustration with being upstaged by his sidekick Virginia \"Dagmar\" Lewis , burnout from having to go through a large amount of material in a short time, and the lack of enough television sets in the United States to make television broadcasting in late nights viable. (Lester himself was a last-minute replacement host for up-and-coming 26-year-old comic Don Hornsby , whom",

      "text": "Late-night talk shows often feature guest interviews. Barack Obama (left) is seen here being interviewed by David Letterman (right). A late-night talk show is a genre of talk show , originating in the United States . It is generally structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. It is characterized by spontaneous conversation , and for an effect of immediacy and intimacy as if the host were speaking directly to each member of the watching audience. Late-night talk shows are also fundamentally shaped by the personality of the host. The late-night talk show format was popularized by Johnny Carson and his sidekick Ed McMahon with The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on NBC . Typically, the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while a guest(s) is seated on a couch. Many late-night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist. Late-night talk shows are a widely viewed format in the United States, but are not as prominent in other parts of the world. Shows that loosely resemble the format air in other countries, but generally air weekly as opposed to the nightly airings of those in the United States. They also generally air in time slots considered to be prime time in the United States.
