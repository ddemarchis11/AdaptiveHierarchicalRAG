Harris spent seven seasons as a lineman in the NFL – three with the Philadelphia Eagles , two more with the Chicago Bears , and a final two years with the Seattle Seahawks . After his retirement from the NFL, Harris began a second career as a coach, leading several indoor football teams as head coach before working as a defensive assistant for the BC Lions , Ottawa Renegades , and Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Personal Richard Harris was born January 21, 1948, in Shreveport, Louisiana . He was raised in the historically segregated Moretown section of the city by his mother, Annice Harris.
