      "text": "Cordelia Botkin (1854 – March 7, 1910) was an American murderer who sent a box of poisoned candy to her ex-lover's wife. This was the first American prosecution for a crime which took place in two different jurisdictions, as Botkin had sent the poison from California, but it was received in Delaware. Background Botkin was born in Polk County, Missouri in 1854. She later moved with her family to California , where she married her husband, Welcome Botkin. They were the parents of one son. In 1895, Botkin met John Preston Dunning while he was bicycling in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park . At the time she was 41 years old, nine years his senior. Both of them were married, but Dunning was smitten with her. Dunning was a highly regarded reporter for the Associated Press , having completed overseas assignments in Samoa and Chile. He had been promoted to superintendent of the Associated Press's Western Division bureau in San Francisco. In 1896, Dunning's wife, Mary Elizabeth (Penington) Dunning, upset by her husband's marital indiscretions, left him and returned with their daughter to Dover, Delaware , to the home of her father, former Congressman John B. Penington . By then Botkin had become Dunning's lover and constant companion. Botkin was estranged from her own husband, a grain broker in Stockton, California , but he supported her",

The term has sometimes been used to refer to electric chairs in general, and not the one used in any specific state. New Jersey New Jersey's Old Smokey is on display at the New Jersey State Police Museum . The chair's most notorious target was Richard Hauptmann , the man behind the Lindbergh kidnapping . The chair at the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton was used in the electrocution of 159 men for capital punishment in New Jersey , starting with Saverio DiGiovanni on December 11, 1907, and ending with Ralph Hudson on January 22, 1963, which also was the final execution carried out in New Jersey. Hauptmann was executed on April 3, 1936. After the death penalty was abolished nationwide in 1972 following Furman v. Georgia , the chair was moved to storage and the chamber was converted to a visitor center. In the 1980s, the chair was put on exhibit at the now-defunct Capital Punishment Museum, housed in a building at the New Jersey State Corrections Academy; after its curator died in 1995, the chair was sent to the New Jersey State Museum and later was transferred to the New Jersey State Police Museum in Ewing Township , where it remains on display. New Jersey abandoned electrocution in favor of lethal injection in",

He was acquitted at trial, thanking Costello in the courtroom after the verdict. Costello was allowed to retire after conceding control of what is today called the Genovese crime family to Genovese. Luciano was powerless to stop these events. On October 25, 1957, Genovese and Gambino successfully arranged the murder of Anastasia, another Luciano ally. The following month, Genovese called a meeting of bosses in Apalachin, New York , to approve his takeover of the Genovese family and to establish his national power. Instead, the Apalachin Meeting turned into a fiasco when law enforcement became aware of the meeting and conducted a raid. Over 65 high-ranking mobsters were arrested, and the Mafia was subjected to publicity and numerous grand jury summonses . The enraged mobsters blamed Genovese for the disaster, opening a window of opportunity for Genovese's opponents. Luciano allegedly attended a meeting at a hotel in Palermo to discuss heroin trade as part of the French Connection . After this meeting, Luciano allegedly helped pay part of $100,000 to a Puerto Rican drug dealer to falsely implicate Genovese in a drug deal. On April 4, 1959, Genovese was convicted in New York of conspiracy to violate federal narcotics laws. Sent to prison for fifteen years,",

With the aid of an uninfected sailor met during the journey for the twins, Smokey establishes a functional homestead of Crossed followers with the aim of outlasting the expected short-lived lifespan attributed to most Crossed. Issue #100 (also by Gage and Fernando Heinz) follows Smokey and the twins as they attempt to fulfill the former's dream of ending the self-destructive nature of the Crossed. Although they manage to establish a reasonably-functional homestead with dozens of followers, Smokey remains depressed and laments to an old sailor that it is a far cry from the new society he had hoped to create. The children he fathered with the twins also seem to be no more intelligent than regular Crossed, leading Smokey to believe that their species is doomed to die out within a generation. Years later, the aging Smokey kills the old sailor by quickly breaking his neck, sparing him from a slow and painful death at the hands of the other Crossed. Shortly after, Smokey is betrayed and left for dead by the twins and his own son 'Cunt', now revealed to have been a \"Super-Crossed\" the entire time; the twins explain that they prefer immediate self-indulgence over long-term planning. Smokey survives the attempted assassination by jumping into a river, emerging later and limping off to fight another day with a smile on his face.",

      "text": "The Journalist and the Murderer is a study by Janet Malcolm about the ethics of journalism , published by Alfred A. Knopf / Random House in 1990. It is an examination of the professional choices that shape a work of non-fiction, as well as a rumination on the morality that underpins the journalistic enterprise. The journalist in question is Joe McGinniss ; the murderer is the former Special Forces captain Dr. Jeffrey R. MacDonald , who became the subject of McGinniss's 1983 book Fatal Vision . When Malcolm's work first appeared in March 1989, as a two-part serialization in The New Yorker , it caused a sensation, becoming the occasion for wide-ranging debate within the news industry. This heavy criticism continued when published in book form a year later. However, The Journalist and the Murderer is now regarded as a \"seminal\" work, and its \"once controversial theory became received wisdom.\" It ranks 97th on the Modern Library 's list of the 100 best non-fiction works of the 20th century.\" Themes Malcolm's thesis, and the most widely quoted passage from The Journalist and the Murderer , is its opening paragraph: \"Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.\" She continues: He is a kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance or loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them",
