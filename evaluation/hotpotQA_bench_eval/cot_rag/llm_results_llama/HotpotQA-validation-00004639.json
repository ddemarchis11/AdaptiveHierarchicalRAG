      "text": "The Battle of Qala-i-Jangi in Afghanistan (sometimes also referred to as the \"Battle of Mazar-i-Sharif \") was a six-day military engagement following an uprising of prisoners of war who had been taken into custody by U.S.-led coalition forces on 25 November 2001. The battle took place from 25 November to 1 December, in northern Afghanistan. It followed the intervention by United States-led coalition forces to overthrow the Taliban 's Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan , which had been harboring al-Qaeda operatives. More than 400 foreign fighters surrendered outside Mazar-i-Sharif and were held at Qala-i-Jangi fortress by the Afghan Northern Alliance forces, where they were interrogated by the anti-Taliban warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum 's fighters and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel hunting al-Qaeda suspects. The prisoners, who had not been searched properly when they surrendered, violently revolted and the ensuing fighting escalated into one of the bloodiest engagements of the conflict . It took Northern Alliance fighters, assisted by British and American special forces and air support, six days to quell the revolt. All but 86 of the prisoners were killed as well as a number of Northern Alliance fighters. The only U.S. fatality was the CIA officer Johnny Micheal Spann , the first American to be killed in combat during the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan . Among the surviving prisoners were two American citizens suspected of fighting",

Background In late November 2001, Taliban commanders, facing defeat in northern Afghanistan, agreed to surrender to the Northern Alliance warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum , leader of the ethnic-Uzbek dominated National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan , outside the besieged city of Kunduz . The surrender was negotiated at Qala-i-Jangi on November 21 between Dostum and Taliban commanders Mullah Mohammed Fazl and Mullah Norullah Noori .

Dostum described the Taliban surrender as a \"great victory\" for the Alliance, a bloodless success that would allow the future reconciliation of citizens of Afghanistan. Thousands of prisoners were transported to the Sheberghan Prison where it was alleged that many of them died due to mistreatment during and after the transport . The CIA wanted to question the foreign fighters about the activities of al-Qaeda . On the evening of November 24, it was decided to transfer the prisoners to Qala-i-Jangi (\"the war fortress\" in Dari ), a 19th-century fortress near Mazar-i-Sharif that Dostum had previously used as his headquarters and ammunition depot. None of the prisoners being moved to the Qala-i-Jangi fort were Afghans. Many of them were Arabs, from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and the Gulf states. There were also Azerbaijanis, Dagastanis, Filipinos, Indonesians, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Pakistanis, Tajiks, Tatars, Turks, Uighurs, and Uzbeks. The group also included Africans from Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, and Sudan. A few fighters appeared to be",
