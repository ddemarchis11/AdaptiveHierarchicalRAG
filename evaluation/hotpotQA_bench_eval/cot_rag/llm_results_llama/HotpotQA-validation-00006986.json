After graduating from Tennessee State University he attended graduate school at the University of Michigan. While studying at the University of Michigan , he played with visiting musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie , Miles Davis , Thad Jones and Billy Mitchell, before going on to play with Sonny Stitt , Count Basie and Al McKibbon , Cannonball Adderley , Percy Heath , Philly Joe Jones , Lou Donaldson , Donald Byrd , Kenny Dorham and Zoot Sims . Smith decided to forgo being a full-time musician to take a music teaching job at Atlanta's Booker T. Washington High School. During this time he continued playing jazz in clubs, eventually going on to record two albums for Blue Note Records . Smith's first session as a leader, Here Comes Louis Smith (1957), originally recorded for the Boston-based Transition Records, featured Cannonball Adderley (then under contract to Mercury) playing under the pseudonym \"Buckshot La Funke\", Tommy Flanagan , Duke Jordan , Art Taylor and Doug Watkins . He also replaced Donald Byrd for Horace Silver's Live at the Newport 1958 set. His playing on the set was one of his best efforts and was described by one critic as \"monstrous\". He was a prolific composer and successful band director leaving Booker T. Washington to become director of the Jazz",

      "text": "Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music . In a career spanning nearly five decades, Davis was at the forefront of several major stylistic developments in jazz, including—but not limited to— bebop , cool jazz , hard bop , third stream , modal jazz , avant-garde jazz , and jazz fusion . Davis's legacy extends beyond jazz into the realms of rock , funk , classical , and hip-hop . Born into an upper-middle-class family in Alton, Illinois , and raised in East St. Louis , Davis started on the trumpet in his early teens. He left to study at Juilliard in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker 's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly afterwards, he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records , which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, while addicted to heroin, Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music under Prestige Records . After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival , he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records , and recorded the album 'Round About Midnight in 1955. It was his first work with",
