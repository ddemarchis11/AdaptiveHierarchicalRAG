In April 2015, the Dragon capsule delivered the ISSpresso , the first zero-G espresso machine which Cristoforetti installed. On 3 May 2015, she brewed the first cup of espresso in space and posted a picture of herself on Twitter , wearing a Starfleet uniform while drinking the espresso, with the comment \" 'There's coffee in that nebula'... ehm, I mean... in that #Dragon\" (referencing Captain Janeway from Star Trek: Voyager , and her love of coffee ). On 28 February 2015, the day following the death of Leonard Nimoy , who portrayed Mr. Spock on Star Trek , she photographed herself in the Cupola , wearing a Starfleet pin on her shirt and giving the Vulcan salute . A one-month delay after the failure of two Russian rockets extended her stay in space past the European astronaut and female astronaut endurance records. As an amateur radio woman , she participated in the ARISS initiative, Amateur Radio on the International Space Station , establishing numerous contacts with schools, both in 2015 and in 2022, answering students' questions. On 16 July 2015, she was awarded the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by Italian President Mattarella , who said: \"She has been followed with affection and love by all Italians.\" The Order of",

      "text": "ISSpresso on the International Space Station ISSpresso was the first espresso coffee machine designed for use in space, produced for the International Space Station by Argotec and Lavazza in a public-private partnership with the Italian Space Agency (ASI). ISSpresso was one of nine experiments selected by the Italian Space Agency for the Futura mission. It was installed on the space station between 2015 and 2017, when it was returned to Earth. History In 2014, Argotec and Lavazza partnered to determine the feasibility of the project. Argotec then approached ASI, with Lavazza as a partner, and ASI agreed to sponsor the ISSpresso as an ASI payload on the ISS. NASA approval was then obtained. During the same year a feasibility study with the creation of some subsystems was conducted in order to validate the technological choices. On 14 April 2015, the flight model of ISSpresso was sent to the International Space Station on SpaceX CRS-6 and on 3 May 2015, Samantha Cristoforetti drank the first espresso in micro-gravity conditions. On 30 September 2017, Paolo Nespoli used the espresso machine on board the ISS to celebrate International Coffee Day . ISSpresso's mission came to an end on 14 December 2017, and the machine was returned to Earth by the SpaceX CRS-13 mission.

This is an Earth-bound image taken in 2015 (gravity is acting on the fluid) Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti drinking espresso out of the cup on ISS, 2015 ISSpresso was designed to prepare espresso. Prior to this experiment, only soluble coffee was available in space. The astronauts could select from the following options: short black (30 ml), long black (60 ml), and hot drink (tea or broth, 120 ml). The machine also featured a flush cycle (60 ml) to clean the hydraulic circuit at the end of supply. The possibility of delivering hot water allowed for the rehydration of space food . ISSpresso also offered the opportunity to study physical phenomena related to the fluid dynamics in microgravity of (pure and mixed) liquids at high pressure and temperature. The analysis of the foam formation with respect to that of the terrestrial coffee was of particular interest, starting from the design of the system in order to obtain it in microgravity. A number of aspects of espresso brewing and consumption are related to or affected by gravity. One of the challenges was trying to produce the beverage in micro-gravity environment. Differences in respect to a commercial espresso maker The first noticeable difference concerns the size and weight: 43 × 42 × 36 cm (17 ×",

In 2017, the European Space Agency (ESA) started human spaceflight training with China Manned Space Agency , with the ultimate goal of sending ESA astronauts to Tiangong space station . To prepare for the future missions, Samantha Cristoforetti and other selected ESA astronauts lived together with their Chinese counterparts and engaged in training sessions such as splashes-down survival, language learning, and Shenzhou spacecraft operations. However, in January 2023, ESA announced that the agency will not send its astronauts to China's space station due to political and financial reasons.

Espresso-based drinks When it is not served by itself, espresso is frequently blended, often with milk— steamed (without significant foam ), wet foamed ( microfoam ), and dry foamed—or hot water. Several are listed below; for reference, espresso typically has a volume between 25–30 ml (0.85–1.01 US fl oz). Caffè mocha Other variants include: Caffè crema : \"long\" espresso from more water and coarser ground coffee, approximately 120–180 ml Espresso con panna : espresso with cream Viennese coffee : 2 shots of espresso with whipped cream Caffè mocha : caffè latte with chocolate Espresso martini : espresso with coffee liqueur and vodka Caffè corretto ('corrected coffee'): espresso with brandy , grappa or sambuca Freddo espresso : espresso is mixed with the sugar and ice in a drink mixer Espresso and tonic See also Italy portal Drink portal Coffee portal List of coffee drinks Caffeinated drink Caffè macchiato Notes References Works cited Illy, Francesco ; Illy, Riccardo (1992).
