It is an international co-production between Israel, France and the United States. The film received acclaim from critics and audiences. It won eight Ophir Prizes awarded by the Israeli Film Academy . It was Israel's original Foreign Language Film submission for the 80th Academy Awards , but was rejected by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences because it contained over 50% English dialogue. Thus, Israel sent Beaufort instead, which was eventually included in the five final nominees. Synopsis The eight men of the Alexandria Ceremonial Police Orchestra arrive in Israel from Egypt . They have been booked by an Arab cultural center in Petah Tikva , but through a miscommunication (Arabic has no \"p\" sound, and regularly replaces it with \"b\"), the band takes a bus to Beit Hatikva , a fictional town in the middle of the Negev Desert . The Egyptians encounter a few Israeli townspeople, who respond with curiosity about the band, are variously friendly and wary, and provide them with shelter, food, music and companionship during their visit.

Gabai also played one of the leading roles in the highly acclaimed Israeli TV series Shtisel , which to date, has run for three seasons (2013-2021). Gabai played the role of Nuchem Shtisel, the paternal uncle of the main protagonist, Akiva Shtisel. Nuchem is also the brother of Shulem Shtisel and father of Libbi Shtisel, Akiva's first cousin, and love interest. Nuchem is an Antwerp-based travel agent who shows up at Shulem's apartment with his daughter Libbi, at the beginning of Season 2. One of Nuchem's first lines in the show is when he explains why he is late, blaming the immigration/custom officials at Ben Gurion airport, and calling them Reshaim Arrurim (Yiddish vernacular for \"accursed evil people\"). Reshaim Arrurim is a line Nuchem reprises to great comedic effect, at the slightest perceived slight, throughout the season. It was initially announced on 28 February 2018 that Gabai would reprise his role as Tewfiq",
