      "text": "The Waynflete Professorships are four professorial fellowships at the University of Oxford endowed by Magdalen College and named in honour of the college founder William of Waynflete , who had a great interest in science. These professorships are statutory professorships of the University, that is, they are professorships established in the university's regulations, and which are by those regulations attached to Magdalen College in particular. The oldest professorship is the Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy. The three science professorships were created following the recommendation of the University Commission in 1857, in recognition of William of Waynflete's lifetime support of science. The professorships are the Waynflete Professor of Chemistry , the Waynflete Professor of Physiology , and the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics . Waynflete Professors of Metaphysical Philosophy This Waynflete Professorship is one of five statutory professorships in philosophy at the University of Oxford, the other four being the Wykeham Professorship in Logic, the White’s Professorship of Moral Philosophy, the Wilde Professor of Mental Philosophy , as well as the untitled professorship in Ancient Philosophy. 1859–1867 Henry Longueville Mansel 1867–1889 Henry William Chandler 1889–1910 Thomas Case 1910–1935 John Alexander Smith 1935–1941 Robin G.

In the United States Thompson Library at Vassar College in New York In the United States, liberal arts colleges are schools emphasizing undergraduate study in the liberal arts. The teaching at liberal arts colleges is often Socratic , typically with small classes; professors are often allowed to concentrate more on their teaching responsibilities than are professors at research universities. Science and mathematics are integral to four-year liberal arts colleges, and indeed their graduates have been demonstrated to be more likely to apply to graduate school in science and mathematics than their peers and make up a higher proportion of National Academy of Science members than would usually be expected for the number of science and mathematics graduates produced by an institution. Traditionally, a bachelor's degree in one particular area within liberal arts, with substantial study outside that main area, is earned over four years of full-time study. However, some universities such as Saint Leo University , Pennsylvania State University , Florida Institute of Technology , and",
