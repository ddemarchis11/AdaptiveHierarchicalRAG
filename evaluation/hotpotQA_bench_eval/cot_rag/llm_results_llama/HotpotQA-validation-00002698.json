      "text": "The Cabécar language is an indigenous American language of the Chibchan language family spoken by the Cabécar people in the inland Turrialba Region , Cartago Province , Costa Rica . As of 2007, 2,000 speakers were monolingual. It is the only indigenous language in Costa Rica with monolingual adults. The language is also known by its dialect names Chirripó, Estrella, Telire, and Ujarrás. History Cabécar is considered to be one of a few \"Chibcha-speaking tribes\", categorized by similarities in the languages that they speak. Other Chibcha speaking tribes include the Bribri and the Boruca , also of Costa Rica. It is believed that the languages of the Chibcha speaking tribes shared a common ancestor around 8,000 years ago. However, differences in the languages are thought to have come about from the influence of outside people, including influences from Mesoamerica . Geographic distribution Cabécar is an endangered language spoken in Costa Rica. It is spoken by the Cabécar people , an indigenous group located near the Talamancan mountains of Costa Rica. Dialects and varieties There are two different dialects of Cabécar, each of which has more narrow dialects within it. One of these is spoken in the north, while the other is spoken in southern parts of Costa Rica. Phonology Cabécar uses a Latin alphabet with umlauts",

      "text": "Bottle filled with \"Catuaba\" bark The name Catuaba ( / k ə ˈ t w ɑː b ə / kə- TWAH -bə , Brazilian Portuguese: [katuˈabɐ] ; ultimately from Guarani ) is used for the infusions of the bark of a number of trees native to Brazil . The most widely used barks are derived from the trees Trichilia catigua and Erythroxylum vaccinifolium . Other catuaba preparations use the bark of trees from the following genera or families: Anemopaegma , Ilex , Micropholis , Phyllanthus , Secondatia , Tetragastris and species from the Myrtaceae . Local synonyms are Chuchuhuasha, Tatuaba, Pau de Reposta, Piratancara and Caramuru. It is often claimed that catuaba is derived from the tree Erythroxylum catuaba , but this tree has been described only once, in 1904, and it is not known today to what tree this name referred. E. catuaba is therefore not a recognised species. Uses A commercial liquid preparation, Catuama, contains multiple ingredients, one of these being catuaba from Trichilia catigua (28.23%), in addition to Guarana (40.31%), Ptychopetalum olacoides",

      "text": "in Maléku and Spanish. According to Espinoza Romero, Mejía Marín & Ovares Barquero 2011, the school, traditionally an acculturation mechanism, has not contributed to strengthening the Maléku identity. For instance, students receive instruction of core subjects in Spanish. They have to learn how to read and write in Spanish first. When they already read and write in the mainstream language, they can learn their language. The authors claim that the norm has been the teaching of the official language: Spanish and that despite the existence of educational policies that contemplate the revitalization of the use of indigenous languages in the region, there is an absence of strategies for teaching aboriginal languages. Dialects The speakers of these three communities have declared that there are differences between the variety spoken by the communities of Margarita and El Sol and the one that is spoken by the people of Tonjibe (Avendaño 2018). Corobicí may have been a dialect. Documentation As pointed out by Constenla 1998:3, little documentation of Maléku was recorded before the latter half of the 19th century. All records from that period are included in Walter Lehmann 's 1920 volume on Central American languages. The first scholar modern linguist to deeply study the Maléku language, aside from sources reproduced by Lehmann, was Adolfo Constenla Umaña , in collaboration with many members of the Maléku",
