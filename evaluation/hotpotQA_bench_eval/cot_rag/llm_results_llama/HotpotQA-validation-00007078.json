He is considered to be the greatest mufassir of the Qur'an . He was the son of Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib , an uncle of Muhammad, and a nephew of Maymunah bint al-Harith , who later became Muhammad's wife . During the early struggles for the caliphate , he supported Ali , and was made governor of Basra . He withdrew to Mecca shortly afterwards. During the reign of Mu'awiya I he lived in Hejaz and often travelled to Damascus . After Mu'awiya I died in 680 CE he migrated to At-Ta'if , where he is resting from around 687 CE. 'Abd Allah ibn Abbas was highly regarded for his knowledge of traditions and his critical interpretation of the Qur'an. From early on, he gathered information from other companions of Muhammad and gave classes and wrote commentaries.

His head was sent to Abd al-Malik, while his body was displayed in a gibbet . The date is variously reported as 4 October or 3 November. Aftermath Ibn al-Zubayr rebuilt the Ka'ba, incorporating the hatīm into it. Hajjaj restored it to the pre-Zubayrid plan, which persists to this day. Ibn al-Zubayr's death marked the end of the civil war, and the Caliphate was united under Umayyad leadership. The year was called the \"Year of Unity\". Hajjaj was appointed governor of the Hejaz, Yemen (southwestern Arabia) and the Yamama (central Arabia). The Ka'ba, which had been damaged by the bombardment—several walls had been cracked by catapult stones—was rebuilt. The original building from the time of Muhammad had been damaged by fire during the previous siege of the city in 683. Ibn al-Zubayr had rebuilt it, changing the design. He altered the square plan to a rectangular one to include the hatīm , following a tradition that Muhammad had wished to do so. He also added an additional doorway to the building; the original had only one. On the orders of Abd",

      "text": "Abdallah ibn al-Fadl al-Antaki ( Arabic : عبد الله بن الفضل بن عبد الله المطران الانطاكي ) was an Arab Orthodox translator and theologian active in Antioch during the middle of the eleventh century, during a period of renewed Byzantine rule over the city. He was responsible for a large number of patristic translations, as well as original theological and philosophical works. Life and work Little is known of his life, apart from what can be gleaned from manuscripts of his texts. He was a deacon and the grandson of a bishop also called Abdallah. He received an excellent education in both Arabic and Greek, having studied Arabic grammar with the famous poet Abul ʿAla Al-Maʿarri and patristic texts with an unidentified teacher called Symeon. Several of his works and translations were commissioned by notables from Antioch and neighbouring cities in Muslim territory. He translated the Loci communes , a Greek florilegium and wrote many works addressing theological and philosophical issues. Ibn al-Fadl's most influential work was the translation of Psalms and of Gospel and Epistle readings into Arabic which remained in use in a variety of Arabic speaking Christian communities until the modern era. His psalms were used in the first printed Arabic book, the Kitab salat al-sawai .",

      "text": "the Hajj rituals. According to an account by the 9th-century historian Baladhuri , the bombardment was halted during the pilgrimage at the request of Abd Allah ibn Umar , an influential son of the second caliph, Umar I . Enraged by Ibn al-Zubayr's refusal to allow him to perform the tawaf (the circumambulation of the Ka'ba), Hajjaj directed catapults to fire on the Ka'ba itself. According to historian Abd al-Ameer Dixon, however, only the part of Ka'ba which had been altered by Ibn al-Zubayr was targeted. A sudden thunderstorm provoked fears of divine wrath among his soldiers and they stopped the bombardment. Hajjaj convinced them that the thunderstorm was a natural phenomena, and if they considered it an omen, it should be taken as a sign of victory. The bombardment was then resumed. The deteriorating situation in the city and Hajjaj's promise of amnesty encouraged some ten thousand defenders, including two of Ibn al-Zubayr's sons, to surrender. Ibn al-Zubayr went to his mother asking her advice on whether to submit to Hajjaj. She persuaded him to fight, citing his old age and the sacrifices of the people who had died fighting for him. He attacked Hajjaj, accompanied by his youngest son and a few remaining followers, including his ex-governor in Kufa Abd Allah",

      "text": "The siege of Mecca ( Arabic : حصار مكة ) occurred at the end of the Second Fitna in 692 when the forces of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan besieged and defeated his rival, the caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr in his center of power, the Islamic holy city of Mecca . After the death of the Umayyad caliph Yazid I in 683, Ibn al-Zubayr had been recognized as caliph in most of the provinces of the Caliphate , while the Umayyads , who had ruled the Caliphate since the end of the First Fitna , had been confined to their stronghold of Syria . There, the pro-Umayyad tribes elected Marwan ibn al-Hakam as caliph in 684; after his death in 685, his son and successor Abd al-Malik undertook the task of reasserting Umayyad authority across the Caliphate. After defeating his enemies in Syria and Iraq , he sent his general Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf to Mecca to defeat Ibn al-Zubayr. To avoid bloodshed in the sanctuary, Hajjaj was ordered to besiege the city and starve out Ibn al-Zubayr. The siege started in March 692 and lasted for six to seven months.

The city was bombarded with catapults and supplies were cut off, resulting in large scale desertions by the followers of Ibn al-Zubayr. He was killed along with his few remaining supporters in October 692. The siege brought an end to the decade-long civil war, and the Caliphate was united under Abd al-Malik. The Ka'ba , which had been damaged by the bombardment, was rebuilt according to its original plan from the time of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . Background With the death of the first Umayyad caliph, Mu'awiya I , in April 680, the Second Fitna broke out, when the prominent Muslim leaders Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr and Husayn ibn Ali , and the people of Medina revolted against Mu'awiya's son and successor, Yazid . Although Husayn and the people of Medina were defeated at the Battle of Karbala in October 680 and the Battle of al-Harra in August 683 respectively, Ibn al-Zubayr continued his opposition to Yazid from the sanctuary of Mecca , the holiest city in Islam . Yazid's forces besieged Mecca in September 683 and bombarded the city with catapults. The Ka'ba caught fire during the siege, which resulted in the sacred Black Stone splitting into three pieces.",
