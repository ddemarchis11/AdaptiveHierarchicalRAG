      "text": "Thomas Henry Moray (August 28, 1892 - May 18, 1974) was an inventor from Salt Lake City , Utah . He received US patent 2,460,707 , \"Electrotherapeutic Device\", in February 1949, after a process of 17 years in discussions with the patent office. During the 1920s, Moray worked in the emerging field of radio. After hundreds of experiments designed to improve radio reception, Moray claimed to have discovered a source of energy transmission apparently available everywhere. Using advanced ideas in solid state detectors , he developed a power source which he claimed to produce 50,000 watts. By the early 1930s, dozens of people had reportedly witnessed demonstrations of this technology  . In 1944 Moray was paid $25 a day by the rural electrification administration to perfect his system of drawing electrical energy out of the atmosphere. He claimed his invention produced electricity with no exterior input of energy. The primary component of the device was a non-heated vacuum tube . At the time most vacuum tubes had heaters built inside. The patent office refused to grant his patent, initially, because they claimed that any vacuum tube without a heater would not work.  He was never granted a patent for his power supply device. He did have other inventions and was able to obtain a patent for one of those, the Electrotherapeutic device. References v t e",

      "text": "Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley ( / ˈ m oʊ z l i / ; 23 November 1887 – 10 August 1915) was an English physicist , whose contribution to the science of physics was the justification from physical laws of the previous empirical and chemical concept of the atomic number . This stemmed from his development of Moseley's law in X-ray spectra . Moseley's law advanced atomic physics, nuclear physics and quantum physics by providing the first experimental evidence in favour of Niels Bohr's theory , aside from the hydrogen atom spectrum which the Bohr theory was designed to reproduce. That theory refined Ernest Rutherford 's and Antonius van den Broek 's model, which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. When World War I broke out in Western Europe , Moseley left his research work at the University of Oxford behind to volunteer for the Royal Engineers of the British Army . Moseley was assigned to the force of British Empire soldiers that invaded the region of Gallipoli , Turkey, in April 1915, as a telecommunications officer. Moseley was shot and killed during the Battle of Gallipoli on 10 August 1915, at the age of 27. Experts have speculated that Moseley could otherwise have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1916. Education and early life",

      "text": "Sommerfeld immediately gave Bethe back his fellowship at Munich. Sommerfeld spent much of the summer term of 1933 finding places for Jewish students and colleagues. Bethe left Germany in 1933, moving to England after receiving an offer for a position as lecturer at the University of Manchester for a year through Sommerfeld's connection to William Lawrence Bragg . He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because he was Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German and he did not have to eat English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in nuclear physics . After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the photodisintegration of deuterium , Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls to come up with a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This they did on the four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester. Bethe would investigate further in the years ahead. In 1933, the physics department at Cornell University , New York , was looking for a new theoretical physicist, and Lloyd Smith strongly recommended Bethe. This was supported by Bragg, who was visiting Cornell at the time. In August 1934, Cornell offered Bethe a position as an acting assistant professor. Bethe had already accepted a fellowship for a year to work with",

      "text": "1915 chemistry prize by Svante Arrhenius ; the Nobel Foundation statutes at the time allowed the prize to be awarded posthumously to a person who died after nomination, so 1915 would be the only chance to award the prize to Moseley. Despite this, the Nobel committee instead awarded the 1915 chemistry prize to Richard Willstätter . The 1917 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to C.G. Barkla \"for his discovery of the characteristic Rontgen radiation of the elements\", work that built strongly on Moseley's. Memorial plaques to Moseley were installed at Manchester and Eton, and a Royal Society scholarship, established by his will, had as its second recipient the physicist P. M. S. Blackett , who later became president of the Society. The Institute of Physics Henry Moseley Medal and Prize is named in his honour.

      "text": "the leader of the group because the writing and submission for publication were done at Caltech in 1956, but Geoffrey Burbidge has stated that this is a misconception. Fowler, though an accomplished nuclear physicist, was still learning Hoyle's theory in 1955 and later stated that Hoyle was the intellectual leader. The Burbidges also learnt Hoyle's theory during 1954–55 in Cambridge. \"There was no leader in the group,\" G. Burbidge wrote in 2008, \"we all made substantial contributions\". Recognition B 2 FH drew scientific attention to the field of nuclear astrophysics . By reviewing the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis and supporting it with observational evidence, B 2 FH firmly established the theory among astronomers. Fowler was awarded half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics , possibly for his contribution to B 2 FH. The Nobel committee stated: \"Together with a number of co-workers, [Fowler] developed, during the 1950s, a complete theory of the formation of the chemical elements in the universe.\" Fowler's contributions to B 2 FH included the nuclear physics of the s -process and the r -process . Some have argued that Fred Hoyle deserved similar recognition for theoretical work on the topic, and contend that his unorthodox views concerning the Big Bang stopped him being awarded a share of the Nobel Prize. Geoffrey Burbidge , for example, argued in 2008 that \"Hoyle should have been awarded",
