It is located in Central , not far from the landmark Bank of China Tower . The Furama Kempinski Hotel , famous for its revolving restaurant, formerly stood on the same lot that the former AIG Tower rises from, but in December 2001, the 33-storey hotel was demolished to make way for the AIG Tower. The tower was renamed to AIA Central on 9 July 2009. The building was jointly developed by Lai Sun Development , CapitaLand , and American International Group (AIG). The architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed the building to look like the Chinese junk , a Chinese sailboat design dating from ancient times and still in use today. Leslie E. Robertson Associates are the structural engineers for this project. As well they included a pedestrian bridge linking the tower to the Hong Kong elevated walkway network. The building has approximately 41,777 m² (450,000 ft²) of office accommodation. Plot history The 999-year leasehold site has an area of 24,427 square feet (2,269 m 2 ).",

According to provisional statistics from the Insurance Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission for Hong Kong's long-term insurance and investment securities business from January to December 2017, AIA has over 3 million customers.

History AIA traces its roots to 19 December 1918 when Cornelius Vander Starr founded what was then known as American Asiatic Underwriters in Shanghai , China (later American International Underwriters). Starr eventually expanded his business throughout the world. On 21 January 1939, Starr relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York City after the Japanese invasion of China and again on 5 April 1949 with the communist takeover of mainland China, and the Chinese AIA became a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG).
