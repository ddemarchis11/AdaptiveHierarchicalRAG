The band currently consists of Aaron Cometbus (drums, lyrics ), Bill Schneider (bass), Billie Joe Armstrong (guitar, vocals) and Jason White (guitar, vocals). The band's name comes from a brand of \"high octane\" green tea served at the Arcata co-op that was discovered by Aaron Cometbus during one of his many dumpster diving adventures.

Cometbus wanted the name \"Pinhead Gunpowder\", while Quittner wanted to call it \"50 Foot Hesher\".
