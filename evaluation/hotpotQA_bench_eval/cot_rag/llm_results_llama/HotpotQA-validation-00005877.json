  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, it appears that Terry Kath obtained fame first. \n\nTerry Kath was born on January 31, 1946, and started his music career in the early 1960s. He joined his first semi-professional band, The Mystics, in 1963. He later played with Jimmy Rice and the Gentlemen in 1965 and then with Jimmy Ford and the Executives, where he became close friends with other musicians who would later join Chicago.\n\nChicago, the band Kath was a part of, released their debut album \"The Chicago Transit Authority\" in 1969. This suggests that Kath gained fame through his work with Chicago in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nRóisín Murphy, on the other hand, was born on July 5, 1973, and first gained fame in the 1990s as part of the pop duo Moloko. Her solo career began in 2005 with the release of her debut album \"Ruby Blue.\"",

Kath struggled with health issues and substance abuse in the late 1970s. In January 1978, he died from an unintentional self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. His death led the members of Chicago to consider disbanding; however, they ultimately chose to continue. Their decision to move forward was reflected in the memorial song \" Alive Again .\" To commemorate his musicianship, they issued the 1997 album The Innovative Guitar of Terry Kath . In 2016, Kath's daughter Michelle Sinclair released the documentary The Terry Kath Experience , which chronicles his life and Chicago's early years. Early life Kath was born to Raymond Elmer \"Ray\" Kath (1912–2003) and Evelyn Meline (nee Haugen) Kath (1916–1982) on January 31, 1946, in Chicago .

In a 1971 interview for Guitar Player , he said he had tried professional lessons but abandoned them, adding \"All I wanted to do was play those rock and roll chords .\" His father wanted him to have a steady career, but he decided he would prefer a career in music.
