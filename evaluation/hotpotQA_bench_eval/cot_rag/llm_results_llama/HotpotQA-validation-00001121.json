Remaining in New York also allowed her to introduce her son to the White House gradually so as not to overwhelm him. According to biographer Mary Jordan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post journalist, \"Melania also used this time to negotiate new terms for her prenuptial agreement with Donald to reflect the changes in their lives since it was signed and to ensure that Barron would receive a suitable inheritance.\" (Mrs. Trump's spokesperson dismissed Jordan's book as \"belonging in the fiction genre\".) Melania's absence from the White House caused speculation that her stepdaughter Ivanka would serve",

The intention was to build her profile in anticipation of another, ultimately unsuccessful, cigarette ad campaign. This was unusual behavior for a woman who typically kept a quiet and professional presence, and reporters were unable to verify the claims she made. The Trumps have stated that they met at the New York Fashion Week shortly after this conference but, according to biographer Mary Jordan , rumors in the industry suggested that their relationship had already developed by then. Their relationship initially only lasted a few weeks. Knauss left Trump after she saw his ex-girlfriend Kara Young leaving Trump Tower , but she reunited with him the following week. Relationship with Donald Trump Donald Trump's fame and connections gave Melania Knauss new career opportunities. Shortly after the death of Jacqueline Kennedy , whom Knauss and her mother had deeply admired, Knauss met the Kennedy family at a gala. She continued to encounter celebrities while attending events with Trump. Knauss continued her modeling career after meeting Trump, though she took fewer jobs as time went on and she dedicated more time to him. In 1999, the couple gained attention after an interview with shock jock Howard Stern on his show, in which he asked them lewd sexual questions. Trump often brought Knauss to meetings to show her off, praising her beauty. He did not let her participate in the business, citing the conflict he had with his",

To have her own private accommodation, Melania had a private spa constructed on the top floor of Trump Tower. As a couple, the two did not spend much direct time together, preferring to live adjacently. According to Donald, their passive relationship suited him because he worked for a living and did not \"want to go home and work at a relationship\". Melania accepted a transactional element in their relationship, though she cared about Donald and did not believe that she was a gold digger . When she attended events with her husband at Trump facilities, she often stayed for only a few minutes to make an appearance before returning to the private residence. Donald did not learn to speak Melania's native language, which she said she accepted because she is \"not a nagging wife\". Upon marrying Donald, Melania became stepmother to his four children: Donald Trump Jr. , Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump from his first marriage to Ivana Zelníčková , and Tiffany Trump from his second marriage to Marla Maples . Melania had especially bonded with Tiffany, who was six when Melania began dating her father, and made sure she felt included among her half-siblings. Melania's pregnancy was widely covered in the media. She again appeared on the cover of Vogue , showing her pregnant body in a bikini and an open coat.",

A controversy emerged after it became apparent that a paragraph of the speech had been plagiarized from Michelle Obama 's speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention . When asked about it, Melania said she wrote the speech herself \"with as little help as possible\". Despite political campaigns typically having several people to scrutinize such speeches, no one in the Trump campaign had reviewed the speech. Donald was furious with his staff and felt he had failed Melania, while Melania felt she herself had failed the campaign through the scandal. It was the only major speech she delivered during the campaign. Two days later, Trump staff writer Meredith McIver took responsibility, saying there was a misunderstanding when Melania read passages of Obama's speech as examples. The speech also included a rare statement on her past, describing her family in Slovenia and her early modeling career. After giving the speech, Melania stayed out of public view until Election Day approached. Access Hollywood tape On October 7, a month before the election, the Access Hollywood tape was leaked. The tape had been recorded in 2005, shortly after their marriage, and it featured audio of Donald making lewd remarks about his treatment of women. Immediately after its release, the campaign's primary concern was Melania's reaction. It took Donald two hours before he went to see Melania. Upon their meeting, Melania reportedly told",

Because Louisa Adams , the only other first lady to be born outside of the United States, had an American father, Trump has been seen by the American public as the first foreigner to become first lady. First tenure as first lady In her first tenure as first lady, Trump worked to protect her privacy as first lady, and her staff was instructed not to answer any questions about her whereabouts at a given time. With limited information, commentators have portrayed her as being a reluctant companion to her husband or as a woman who has no independence of her own. Several incidents during her husband's presidency led to rumors that she had a secret animosity toward her husband, such as her delay in moving to the White House and allegations that he had committed adultery. The rumors led to popular use of the hashtag #FreeMelania by those who believed them. Though she disliked the idea that people saw her as helpless, Melania found the campaign amusing. This became less common by 2020 as she had become more publicly associated with the role of first lady. She is often seen as cold by the public, though people who interact with her describe her as a warm presence. As with previous first ladies, Trump's fashion was heavily scrutinized, and particularly expensive pieces were criticized. More than other first ladies, her fashion was",
