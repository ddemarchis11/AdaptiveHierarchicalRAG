Hemsworth stated that the film addresses unresolved issues regarding Thor's relationships from previous films, \"For Thor and Jane, there are some unanswered questions now, since obviously he didn't stop in and catch up with her in The Avengers (2012). Thor might have some explaining to do in this one. And with Loki, we get down to the major bones of our conflict with everything that's come from Thor to Avengers to now.\" Hemsworth added, \"Thor's journey I think picks more so up from where we left the first one—About to take on the throne... and now coming to the realization of what responsibility comes with that. Also, Alan [Taylor] keeps talking about the dark side of that responsibility, and the secrets of being king or becoming sort of very political about what people need to know and what they want to know.\" Hemsworth especially enjoyed the role of Thor in this film as he was able to, \"... break him down and find his human qualities and his vulnerable side.\" Natalie Portman as Jane Foster : An astrophysicist and Thor's love interest",

Henry Barnes of The Guardian was impressed with Hemsworth's performance, praising the actor for delivering the \"superb script\" with \"some mastery.\" Later that year, Hemsworth reprised the role of Thor for the sequel to Thor in Thor: The Dark World (2013). Although a commercial success with a worldwide gross of US$644.6 million, the film became the lowest-rated film in the MCU franchise on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes at 66% approval rating. The chemistry between Hemsworth and Hiddleston was praised by critics; Ben Child of The Guardian wrote, \"Thanks to Hiddleston and Hemsworth's impressive collective charisma, Thor: The Dark World is far from a franchise killer.\" In 2015, Hemsworth starred in director Michael Mann 's action thriller Blackhat , opposite Viola Davis . The film bombed at the box office and was poorly received. For many critics, a significant issue of the film was the casting of Hemsworth as a hacker; Christy Lemire of the Chicago Sun-Times remarked, \"Anyone who makes [their] way in the world sitting in front of a computer screen all day is not going to look as hunky as Hemsworth.\" Hemsworth himself later admitted to being displeased with his performance: \"I didn't enjoy what I did in the film,\"",

Here's what I would say to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether there should be a second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [among] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true\". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, \" Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [Branagh] to discuss coming back, but right now the focus is on the first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky\". In June 2011, Walt Disney Studios set a July 26, 2013, release date for the Thor sequel with Chris Hemsworth reprising his role",
