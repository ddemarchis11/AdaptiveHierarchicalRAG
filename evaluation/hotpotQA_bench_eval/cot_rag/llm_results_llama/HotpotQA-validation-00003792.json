According to Shomo, he had to learn how to sing and struggled how to do scream vocals, but managed to get through it. They released their self-titled second studio album on June 8, 2010, and peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200, selling more than 15,000 copies in its first week. Shomo features clean vocals on tracks 1 to 5 and 17 and 18 of their deluxe release of their second album. In November 2011, the band announced their third studio album titled This Means War . It was released on January 17, 2012, and has since become the band's best charting Billboard topping album, debuting and peaking at number 11 on the Billboard 200, selling more than 17,000 copies in its first week. Despite the band's growing success, Caleb Shomo left the band later that year due to clinical depression he had been dealing with since middle school. This had been causing him to have suicidal tendencies, and struggle with eating disorders, self-image problems and various substance abuse and addictions for the past year. Despite this, he left the band on good terms with the rest of the band supporting his decision. The band itself officially disbanded",
