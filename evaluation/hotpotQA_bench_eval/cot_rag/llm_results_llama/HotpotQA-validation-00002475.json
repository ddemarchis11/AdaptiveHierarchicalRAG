      "text": "\" A Little Time \" is a song by English pop rock group the Beautiful South , the first single to be released from their second album, Choke (1990). It was released in September 1990 by Go! Discs and consists of a duet featuring vocalists Dave Hemingway and Briana Corrigan . Produced by Mike Hedges , \"A Little Time\" is the band's only single to reach number one on the UK singles chart , and it peaked inside the top 20 in Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Its accompanying music video was directed by Nick Brandt and won the British Video of the Year award at the 1991 Brit Awards . Lyrical content The Beautiful South have given different interpretations about the song's meaning. Songwriter Paul Heaton stated that \"A Little Time\" is about relationships in general, while co-writer David Rotheray considers it an unconventional love song . Briana Corrigan explained that the song encapsulates an everyday situation, as love is not always a good thing and can lead to conflict. Critical reception Upon its release, Nick Duerden, writing for Record Mirror , described the song as \"a sloping country lilt that unfolds so gracefully and quietly that it is truly touching\" and added that the band's \"sardonic humour is present as ever\". Nick Robinson of Music Week praised it as a \"beautiful ballad\" and \"a tale of a crumbling relationship softly sung",

      "text": "Briana Corrigan (born 30 May 1965) is a Northern Irish singer. She was a member of The Beautiful South from 1988 to 1992. Early life Corrigan was born in Northern Ireland . When she was 11 years old, her family moved from Belfast to Portstewart , County Londonderry , where she attended Dominican College, Portstewart , the school at which her mother taught. She moved to Newcastle upon Tyne in England at the age of 18 to study for a BA in creative and performing arts. Beautiful South While studying in Newcastle upon Tyne, Corrigan began singing with The Anthill Runaways. Go! Discs Records , which was considering signing the band, made her an offer to travel to Hull and sing with Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway of The Beautiful South. Soon after she was asked to go to Milan with the band to help record their debut album , Welcome to the Beautiful South . She appeared alongside Dave Hemingway on the band's only UK Singles Chart number 1 single , \" A Little Time \". After appearing on three albums, Corrigan left the band in 1992 to pursue a solo career . The decision was driven by a desire to record her own work and partly by ethical disagreements with some of Heaton's lyrics , particularly songs such as \" 36D \", which criticised British glamour models and the industry that employed them. Her time with the band culminated",

      "text": "The Beautiful South were an English pop rock group formed in 1988 by former Housemartins members Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway , both of whom performed lead and backing vocals. The other original members were guitarist Dave Rotheray , bassist Sean Welch , and drummer Dave Stead . All five original members remained with the band throughout its existence. The band's original material was written by Heaton and Rotheray. After recording their first album, Welcome to the Beautiful South (1989), as a five-piece, they were joined by a succession of female vocalists; Briana Corrigan from 1990 to 1992, Jacqui Abbott from 1993 to 2000, and Alison Wheeler from 2003 to the band's split in 2007. The group are known for wry and socially observant lyrics. They broke up in January 2007, saying the split was due to \"musical similarities\", having sold around 15 million records. History 1988: Formation Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway had initially come to attention as (respectively) the lead singer and \"singing drummer\" of the successful Hull jangle pop band the Housemartins , who had scored seven UK Top 40 singles and two Top 10 albums between 1986 and 1988. (Heaton was with the Housemartins for their entire existence; Hemingway joined in time for their second and final album.) The",

      "text": "(Heaton was with the Housemartins for their entire existence; Hemingway joined in time for their second and final album.) The band was known for blending overt socialist politics and a form of Christianity , having baited the British monarchy , the building industry, and South African apartheid in their songs as well as including gospel elements in their music. The Housemartins said they had set a fixed lifespan for themselves; the members duly brought the band to an end in 1988 at the height of its success. Heaton and Hemingway immediately began work on setting up a new band, naming it \"the Beautiful South\" as a sarcastic comment on their staunch Northern roots. The third initial bandmember was Dave Rotheray , a songwriting guitarist who had previously played with Hemingway in two other Hull bands, the Newpolitans and the Velvetones. At the time Rotheray was studying for a PhD at the University of Hull and living on Grafton Street, where Heaton also lived. Rotheray and Heaton became the songwriting team for the Beautiful South, which was conceived as a quintet with Heaton and Hemingway (who was no longer drumming) as the two lead singers. The core band was completed by Dave Stead (ex-Luddites/Vicious Circle) on drums, and former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch on bass guitar. Also important to the band's sound was studio keyboard player Damon Butcher—although",

Awards The music video for \"A Little Time\" won the 1991 Brit Awards for British Video of the Year , directed by English photographer Nick Brandt , which is their only Brit Award to date.

With the follow-up single \" You Keep It All In \" reaching number eight and \"I'll Sail This Ship Alone\" reaching number 31, the band were soon set to equal or surpass the success of the Housemartins, while the songwriting built on and expanded the trenchant social critiques which the previous band had been known for. Topics included nationalism, domestic violence, football hooliganism and the self-serving industry of love songs, and the album's disturbing cover art also drew attention. Northern Irish singer Briana Corrigan was featured as a background vocalist on the album. Her contributions proved so successful that she was soon promoted to full membership status, as the band's third vocalist. 1990-91: Choke In 1990, the Beautiful South released their second album, Choke . Two singles—\"My Book\" and \"Let Love Speak Up Itself\"—charted outside the Top 40, but the album also provided the band's only Number 1",
