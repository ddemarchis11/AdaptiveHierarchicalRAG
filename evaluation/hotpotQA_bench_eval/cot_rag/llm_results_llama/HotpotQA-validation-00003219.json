Guy Hoffman , formerly of the Oil Tasters and BoDeans , was brought in to tour what was to become one of the Violent Femmes' biggest-selling records, the Add It Up (1981–1993) collection. Over the next nine years, the band, with Hoffman, recorded five full-length CDs and a handful of one-offs for motion picture soundtracks, such as \"I Swear It (I Can Change)\" from the South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut soundtrack , \"Color Me Once\" for the soundtrack to The Crow , and other compilation projects.  In 1997, the band appeared as themselves in the fifteenth episode of the TV show Sabrina, the Teenage Witch , \"Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years\". The first full studio album with Hoffman on drums, New Times ( Elektra Records ), was released in 1994, and the band scored another minor hit with the song \"Breakin' Up\". Rock!!!!!

They were the first major recurring characters outside of the Simpson family to appear. As a child, series creator Matt Groening and his friends would fantasize about an ultra-violent cartoon and how much fun it would be to work on a show like that. The names \"Itchy\" and \"Scratchy\" were inspired by Pixie and Dixie, which was a segment on the cartoon show The Huckleberry Hound Show . The comic strip Squeak the Mouse is also considered an apparent inspiration for the characters. As a child, Groening really liked the 1961 Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians , and it was one of the reasons to why he got into cartooning. In the film, the puppies watch television, and the idea of having a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening. From that idea he got the inspiration for Itchy & Scratchy . David Silverman states that Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are \"an ironic commentary on cartoon mayhem in the sense that it's taken to a more realistic level. The kids on The Simpsons are laughing at it, and we're laughing too, but part of what you're laughing at is the over-the-top excessiveness of the",

The only four episodes where the whole gang is in The Circle are \" Class Picture \", \" I'm A Boy \", \" Substitute \", and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, The Circle (sans the smoke) replaced the Formans' Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.  Beginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: Led Zeppelin (season 5), The Who (season 6), The Rolling Stones (season 7), and Queen (season 8, except for the finale, titled \"That '70s Finale\"). For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser.
