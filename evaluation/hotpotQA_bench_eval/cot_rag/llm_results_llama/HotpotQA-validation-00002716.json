These experiences inspired Byron to write political poems such as Song for the Luddites (1816) and The Landlords' Interest , Canto XIV of The Age of Bronze . Examples of poems in which he attacked his political opponents include Wellington : The Best of the Cut-Throats (1819) and The Intellectual Eunuch Castlereagh (1818). Poetic works Byron wrote prolifically. In 1832 his regular publisher, John Murray, released the complete works in 14 duodecimo volumes, including a life by Thomas Moore . Subsequent editions were released in 17 volumes, first published in 1833. An extensive collection of his works, including early editions and annotated manuscripts, is held within the John Murray Archive at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh. Don Juan Byron's magnum opus , Don Juan , a poem spanning 17 cantos, ranks as one of the most important long poems published in England since John Milton 's Paradise Lost . Byron published the first two cantos anonymously in 1819 after disputes with his regular publisher over the shocking nature of the poetry. By this time, he had been a famous poet for seven years, and when he self-published the beginning cantos, they were well received in some quarters. The poem was then released volume by volume through his regular publishing house. By 1822, cautious acceptance by the public had turned to outrage, and",

      "text": "Aphra Behn ( / ˈ æ f r ə b ɛ n / ; bapt. 14 December 1640 – 16 April 1689) was an English playwright , poet, prose writer and translator from the Restoration era . As one of the first English women to earn her living by her writing, she broke cultural barriers and served as a literary role model for later generations of women authors. Rising from obscurity, she came to the notice of Charles II , who employed her as a spy in Antwerp . Upon her return to London and a probable brief stay in debtors' prison , she began writing for the stage. She belonged to a coterie of poets and famous libertines such as John Wilmot, Lord Rochester . Behn wrote under the pastoral pseudonym Astrea . During the turbulent political times of the Exclusion Crisis , she wrote an epilogue and prologue that brought her legal trouble; she thereafter devoted most of her writing to prose genres and translations. A staunch supporter of the Stuart line, Behn declined an invitation from Bishop Burnet to write a welcoming poem to the new king William III . She died shortly after. She is remembered in Virginia Woolf 's A Room of One's Own : \"All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn which is, most scandalously but rather appropriately, in Westminster Abbey , for it was she who earned them the right to speak their",

      "text": "George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron (22 January 1788 – 19 April 1824), was a British poet . He was one of the major figures of the Romantic movement , and is regarded as being among the greatest British poets. Among his best-known works are the lengthy narratives Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage ; many of his shorter lyrics in Hebrew Melodies also became popular. Byron was educated at Trinity College at the University of Cambridge . Following graduation, he travelled extensively in Europe, living for seven years in Italy, in Venice , Ravenna , Pisa , and Genoa , and then was forced to flee to England after receiving threats of lynching . During his stay in Italy, he would frequently visit his friend and fellow poet Percy Bysshe Shelley . Later in life, Byron joined the Greek War of Independence to fight the Ottoman Empire , for which Greeks revere him as a folk hero . He died leading a campaign in 1824, at the age of 36, from a fever contracted after the first and second sieges of Missolonghi.
