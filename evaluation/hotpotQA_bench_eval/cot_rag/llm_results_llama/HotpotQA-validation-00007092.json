      "text": "Michael Jackson's This Is It is a 2009 American documentary film about Michael Jackson 's preparation for This Is It , a planned concert residency that was cancelled due to his death in 2009. It includes behind-the-scenes footage such as dancer auditions and costume design. The director, Kenny Ortega , confirmed that none of the footage was originally intended for release, but, after Jackson's death, it was agreed that the film would be made. The footage was filmed in California at the Staples Center and The Forum . The film was given a worldwide release and a limited two-week theatrical run from October 28 to November 12, 2009, but the theatrical release was later extended for an additional three weeks in domestic theaters and one to three weeks in overseas markets. Tickets went on sale a month early on September 27 to satisfy a high anticipated demand; the film broke numerous pre-sale and box office records. AEG Live faced criticism, mostly consisting of claims that they had made the film only to make a profit. Multiple members of Jackson's family had confirmed that they did not support the film, and some family members went as far as to try to stop the film agreement in August. The film has also been surrounded by allegations regarding the appearance of body doubles in place of Jackson, which Sony denied, and it faced outrage from some of Jackson's fans , with some going as far as to start a protest against the film. In August 2009, a judge approved a",

At the time of Jackson's death, and in its aftermath, multiple reports surfaced that AEG Live purposely tried to hide Jackson's health concerns during preparations for his proposed concerts. Concerns included Jackson's frail appearance due to lack of nutrition that had reportedly caused him to be unable to perform properly, causing AEG to use stand-ins during rehearsals. On October 23, 2009, days before the film's release, fans of Jackson launched a protest campaign against the film entitled \"This Is not It\". The campaign's focus was to convince people that Jackson's health was neglected by AEG, among others, and that AEG was partly responsible for Jackson's death which they were now profiting from. The group started a website and created their own 'trailer' for the movie to showcase their point-of-view on the documentary. The protestors also inaccurately claimed that Jackson was 108 pounds ( 49 kg ) at his death, contradicting Jackson's autopsy, which had stated that Jackson weighed 136 pounds (61 kg). Shortly after the protest became news, The Guardian conducted a poll on their website asking users \"What do you think of Michael Jackson's posthumous film Is This It?\", 51.4% agreed with one of the two options: \"I agree with the fans who are boycotting it — it's shameless",

Animated films are not copies of 'real movies,' are not shadows of reality, but create a new existence in their own right.\" He concluded his review of Ratatouille by writing: \"Every time an animated film is successful, you have to read all over again about how animation isn't 'just for children' but 'for the whole family,' and 'even for adults going on their own.' No kidding!\" Ebert championed documentaries, notably Errol Morris 's Gates of Heaven : \"They say you can make a great documentary about anything, as long as you see it well enough and truly, and this film proves it. Gates of Heaven , which has no connection to the unfortunate Heaven's Gate , is about a couple of pet cemeteries and their owners. It was filmed in Southern California, so of course we expect a sardonic look at the peculiarities of the Moonbeam State. But then Gates of Heaven grows ever so much more complex and frightening, until at the end it is about such large issues as love, immortality, failure, and the dogged elusiveness of the American Dream.\" Morris credited Ebert's review with putting him on the map. He championed Michael Apted 's Up films , calling them \"an inspired, even noble use of the medium.\" Ebert concluded his review of Hoop Dreams by writing: \"Many filmgoers are reluctant to see",

The site's general consensus is that \"While it may not be the definitive concert film (or the insightful backstage look) some will hope for, Michael Jackson's This Is It packs more than enough entertainment value to live up to its ambitious title.\" Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 67 based on 32 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times described the film as being an \"extraordinary documentary\", and stated that the film was \"nothing at all like what\" he was expecting to see. Ebert dismissed reports that Jackson was in poor health and was underperforming, stating that the film didn't show a \"sick and drugged man forcing himself through grueling rehearsals, but a spirit embodied by music\" and referred to Jackson's rehearsal performance(s) as having been \"something else\". Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film for being \"strange yet strangely beguiling\" for capturing Jackson in \"feverish grips of pure creativity\" and stated that while the film presents that audience with a screen filled with everyone ranging from \"performers, musicians, choreographers, crew members, craftsmen\", he took notice that the film had primarily",
