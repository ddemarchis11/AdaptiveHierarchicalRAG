      "text": "Another effect of Unification was to delete the appointments of lance-corporal and lance-sergeant (a corporal holding the acting rank of sergeant). The former is still common in other Commonwealth militaries. Corporal is deemed to be the substantive rank of the members carrying the appointment of master corporal. On pay documents, corporal was formerly listed as \"Cpl (A)\" and master corporal as \"Cpl (B)\". In rifle regiments, a distinction was historically drawn between a corporal and an acting corporal; The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada had a special insignia to distinguish between the two. Germany Corporal or Korporal was the most junior NCO grade in many German partial states of Deutscher Bund , before the term was replaced by the word Unteroffizier in the middle of the 19th century. In September 2021, the Bundeswehr reimplemented the grade of Korporal, but this time as a senior enlisted rank below NCO level. Additionally, a completely new rank was created with the grade of Stabskorporal what is the most senior enlisted rank now. Both ranks are classified OR-4 in the NATO rank code system . In the Bundeswehr, both ranks share paygrade A6 with the junior NCO rank Stabsunteroffizier . France There are three ranks of corporal ( French : caporal ). In the French Army , these are not NCO ranks, but",

Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel , published in 1963 and translated in English in 1986, is Foucault's only book-length work on literature. He described it as \"by far the book I wrote most easily, with the greatest pleasure, and most rapidly\". Foucault explores theory, criticism, and psychology with reference to the texts of Raymond Roussel , one of the first notable experimental writers. Foucault also gave a lecture responding to Roland Barthes' famous essay \" The Death of the Author \" titled \" What Is an Author? \" in 1969, later published in full. According to literary theoretician Kornelije Kvas, for Foucault, \"denying the existence of a historical author on account of his/her irrelevance for interpretation is absurd, for the author is a function of the text that organizes its sense\". Power Foucault's analysis of power comes in two forms: empirical and theoretical . The empirical analyses concern themselves with historical (and modern) forms of power and how these emerged from previous forms of power. Foucault describes three types of power in his empirical analyses: sovereign power, disciplinary power, and biopower . Foucault is generally critical of \"theories\" that try to give absolute answers to \"everything\". Therefore, he considered his own \"theory\" of power to be closer to",

Von Szalay and Raymond Bayless's work was published by the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research in 1959. Bayless later went on to co-author the 1979 book, Phone Calls From the Dead . In 1959, Swedish painter and film producer Friedrich Jürgenson was recording bird songs. Upon playing the tape later, he heard what he interpreted to be his dead father's voice and then the spirit of his deceased wife calling his name. He went on to make several more recordings, including one that he said contained a message from his late mother. Raudive voices Konstantin Raudive , a Latvian psychologist who had taught at Uppsala University , Sweden, and who had worked in conjunction with Jürgenson, made over 100,000 recordings which he described as being communications with discarnate people. Some of these recordings were conducted in an RF-screened laboratory and contained words Raudive said were identifiable. In an attempt to confirm the content of his collection of recordings, Raudive invited listeners to hear and interpret them. He believed that the clarity of the voices heard in his recordings implied that they could not be readily explained by normal means.
