      "text": "former pulp magazines are science fiction or mystery magazines, now in formats similar to \" digest size \", such as Analog Science Fiction and Fact , though the most durable revival of Weird Tales began in pulp format, though published on good-quality paper. The old format is still in use for some lengthy serials, like the German science fiction weekly Perry Rhodan (over 3,000 issues as of 2019).  Over the course of their evolution, there were a huge number of pulp magazine titles; Harry Steeger of Popular Publications claimed that his company alone had published over 300, and at their peak they were publishing 42 titles per month. Many titles of course survived only briefly. While the most popular titles were monthly, many were bimonthly and some were quarterly. The collapse of the pulp industry changed the landscape of publishing because pulps were the single largest sales outlet for short stories.  Combined with the decrease in slick magazine fiction markets, writers trying to support themselves by creating fiction switched to novels and book-length anthologies of shorter pieces. Some ex-pulp writers like Hugh B. Cave and Robert Leslie Bellem had moved on to writing for television by the 1950s.  The last pulp to cease publication was Ranch Romances in 1971. Genres Planet Stories , a science fiction pulp published between 1939 and 1955 Pulp magazines often contained a wide variety of genre fiction , including, but not limited to: adventure aviation detective / mystery",

It had the same publisher as lesbian erotica magazine On Our Backs , but distanced itself from its pornographic counterpart by refusing to carry sexual ads. Girlfriends magazine ceased publication in 2006. One of the major features of the magazine was its annual list on the best cities for a lesbian to live in, which it began publishing in 1994. The magazine also ran an online personals service through its website while it was still in operation. See also LGBT culture in San Francisco Notes v t e",

Cattell had a background in academics and continued publishing articles for educated readers. By 1915, the readership was declining and publishing a science journal was a financial challenge. In a September 1915 editorial, Cattell related these difficulties to his readers and announced that the Popular Science Monthly name had been transferred to the Modern Publishing Company to start a new publication for general audiences. The existing academic journal would continue publishing under the name The Scientific Monthly , retaining existing subscribers. Scientific Monthly was published until 1958 when it was absorbed into Science . After acquiring the Electrician and Mechanic magazine in 1914, the Modern Publishing Company had merged it with Modern Electrics to become Modern Electrics & Mechanics . Later that year, they merged the publication with Popular Electricity and World's Advance to form Popular Electricity and Modern Mechanics .
