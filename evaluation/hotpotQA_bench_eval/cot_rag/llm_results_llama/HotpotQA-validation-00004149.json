      "text": "Weight for Age ( WFA ) is a term in thoroughbred horse racing which is one of the conditions for a race. History The principle of WFA was developed by Admiral Rous , a handicapper with the English Jockey Club . Rous experimented with weights until he arrived at a relationship between age and maturity, expressed in terms of weight.
