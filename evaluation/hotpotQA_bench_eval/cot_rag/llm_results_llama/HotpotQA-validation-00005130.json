      "text": "Sheridan County is a county in the U.S. state of Montana . As of the 2020 census , the population was 3,539. Its county seat is Plentywood . Its northern boundary is the Canada–United States border south of Saskatchewan . History The Montana Legislature established Sheridan County in 1913 from portions of Dawson and Valley Counties. It was named for American Civil War General Philip Sheridan . In the 1920s and 1930s the county was a hotbed of communist organizing. The CPUSA managed to elect several town and county officials. At the 1932 presidential election the communist candidate William Z. Foster got 576 votes (22%). International changes in communist organizing strategies, especially the move towards the popular front , effectively ended communist presence in the area. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau , the county has a total area of 1,706 square miles (4,420 km 2 ), of which 1,677 square miles (4,340 km 2 ) is land and 29 square miles (75 km 2 ) (1.7%) is water.
