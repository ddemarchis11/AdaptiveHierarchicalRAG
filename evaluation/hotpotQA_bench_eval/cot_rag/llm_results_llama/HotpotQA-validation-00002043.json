It was founded in July 2006 by members of the Bereaved by Work North West support group and the Greater Manchester Hazards Centre. The organisation campaigns for increased funding for the enforcement of health and safety law and changes to the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 - which currently only imposes financial penalties - to make directors criminally responsible for health and safety offences with the possibility of imprisonment . Co-founder Hilda Palmer said: \"Fines alone are an insufficient penalty for taking a life.\" FACK also lobbies for the introduction of juries at all work-related inquests in England and Wales. They also provide guidance for bereaved families to obtain legal help and emotional support. The organisation has submitted evidence to both the English and Scottish parliaments, and in July 2011 met with Professor Ragnar Löfstedt as part of a government review of health and safety legislation ordered by Chris Grayling MP, Minister of State in the Department for Work and Pensions . The review was held under the \"removing burdens on business\" agenda, a position the organisation opposed by stating that \"victims of employers' crimes pay the price for employers' negligence rather than business bearing the burden.\" The independent health and safety journal Hazards described the review as \"not really about changing the law. It's about risk",

The organisation was founded from the Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge on 22 December 1941. The founding president of the council was Swami Satyananda Puri , along with Debnath Das as the founding secretary. Along with the Indian Independence League , it came to be one of the two prominent Indian associations that corresponded with I Fujiwara 's F Kikan on the scopes of Japanese assistance to the Indian movement. However, the Indian National Council emphasised solidarity with the Indian National Congress and, at a time when Japan began her successful Malayan Campaign , the council reflected the Congress leadership's reluctance to appear Quisling of the Japanese. The council also had differences with the Indian Independence League , with Puri openly questioning Tokyo's anti-imperialist credibility in light of her actions in Korea and China. Puri was killed in a plane crash, along with Giani Pritam Singh en route to the Conference in Tokyo in 1942 that saw Rash Behari Bose accepted as the leader of the expatriate Indian movement in South-east Asia. Later, the council sent delegates to attend the Bangkok Conference . Notes References Bhargava, M.L. (1982), Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in South-East Asia and India's Liberation War .

The festival is held annually in Miami, Florida and features films, documentaries, and web series with black writers, directors, and actors. History Founding: \"Because Hollywouldn't\" Cheryl R. Riley poses with Morgan Freeman at the 1997 Acalpuco Black Film Festival holding the award she designed. The first Acapulco Black Film Festival was held in June 1997. The aim of its founders, Jeff Friday, Byron E. Lewis and Warrington Hudlin , was to create a venue at which members of \"Black Hollywood \" could meet, network, collaborate, and celebrate black cinema. In an interview, Friday said that one of the main motivations for the festival was that \"[a]ll minorities are shut down from the private party we call Hollywood. We are let in one at a time, and the masses don't get the information, or don't have access to the decision making, or are not in a position to green-light a project. What we have plan[ned] is more of the same, which is more information, more network opportunities, and to further our mission to provide minorities and people of color with a fair shot at breaking into the Hollywood system.\" Lewis, CEO of UniWorld Group , and",
