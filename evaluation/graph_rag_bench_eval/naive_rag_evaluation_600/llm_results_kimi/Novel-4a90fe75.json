How are you all at home?\" he added, \"and what is going on in your set?\" Now it was the woodmouse's turn to look confused. \"My son is to be married on the second evening after this,\" he said. \"That is the only thing I know of.\" \"What?\" cried <DW53>. \"Your son Prick-ear? Why, he is one of my best friends! How strange that I should have heard nothing of it!\" \"We didn't know--we really thought--we supposed you were asleep!\" stammered the woodmouse. \"And so you chose this time for the wedding?\" said the raccoon. \"Now, I call that unfriendly, Woodmouse, and I shouldn't have thought it of you.\" The woodmouse stroked his whiskers, and looked piteously at his formidable acquaintance. \"Don't be offended, <DW53>!\" he said. \"Perhaps--perhaps you will come to the wedding, after all. Eh? of course we should be delighted.\" \"Yes, to be sure I will come!\" said the raccoon, cheerily. \"_I_ don't bear malice. Oh, yes! I will come, and Toto shall come, too. Where is it to take place?\" \"We--we have engaged the cave for the evening,\" said the woodmouse, with some diffidence. \"We have a large family connection, you know, and it is the only place big enough to hold them all.\" <DW53> stared in amazement, and Toto gave a long whistle. \"The cave, eh?\" he said. \"I should say this was to be something very grand indeed. I should like very much to come, Woodmouse, if you think it would not trouble any of your family. I promise you that <DW53> shall be on his very best behavior, and--I'll tell you what!\" he added, \"I will provide the music, as I did last summer, at the Rabbit's Rinktum.\" \"No, not really! will you, though?\" cried the little woodmouse, his slender tail quivering with delight. \"We shall be infinitely obliged, Mr. Toto, infinitely obliged, sir! We shall count upon you both. Bring Cracker, too, and any other friends who may be staying with you. Would your grandmother, possibly--eh? care to come?\" \"Thank you!\" said Toto, gravely, \"I think not. My grandmother never goes out in the evening.\" \"We might bring Bruin!\" suggested <DW53>, with a sly wink at Toto. But here the poor little woodmouse looked so unutterably distressed, that the two friends burst out laughing; and reassuring him by a word, bade him good-day, and proceeded on their walk.

Come here and be introduced to the family!\" Thus adjured, the crow hopped solemnly forward, and made his best bow to the three inmates, who in turn saluted him, each after his or her fashion. The raccoon was gracious and condescending, the squirrel familiar and friendly, the parrot frigidly polite, though inwardly resenting that a crow should be presented to her,--to _her_, the favorite attendant of the late lamented Princess of Central Africa,--without her permission having been asked first. As for the crow, he stood on one leg and blinked at them all in a manner which meant a great deal or nothing at all, just as you chose to take it. \"Distinguished persons!\" he said, gravely, \"it is with pleasure that I make your acquaintance. May this day be the least happy of your lives! Lady Parrot,\" he added, addressing himself particularly to Miss Mary, \"grant me the honor of leading you within. The evening air is chill for one so delicate and fragile.\" Miss Mary, highly delighted at being addressed by such a stately title as \"Lady Parrot,\" relaxed at once the severity of her mien, and gracefully sidled into the house in company with the sable-clad stranger, while Toto and the two others followed, much amused. After a hearty supper, in the course of which Toto related as much of his and Bruin's adventures in the hermit's cave as he thought proper, the whole family gathered around the blazing hearth. Toto brought the pan of apples and the dish of nuts; the grandmother took up her knitting, and said, with a smile: \"And who will tell us a story, this evening? We have had none for two evenings now, and it is high time that we heard something new. Cracker, my dear, is it not your turn?\" \"I think it is,\" said the squirrel, hastily cramming a couple of very large nuts into his cheek-pouches, \"and if you like, I will tell you a story that Mrs. Cow told me a day or two ago. It is about a cow that jumped over the moon.\" \"What!\" cried Toto. \"Why, I've known that story ever since I was a baby! And it isn't a story, either, it's a rhyme,-- \"Hey diddle diddle, The cat and the fiddle, The cow--\" \"Yes, yes! I know, Toto,\" interrupted the squirrel. \"She told me that, too, and said it was a pack of lies, and that people like you didn't know anything about the real truth of the matter. So now, if you will just listen to me, I will tell you how it really happened.\" THE MOON-CALF. There once was a young cow, and she had a calf. \"And that's half!\"",

Last of all, you should have seen the dear old grandmother, the beloved Madam, with her snowy curls and cap and kerchief; and the ebony stick which generally lived in a drawer and silver paper, and only came out on great occasions. How proud Toto was of his Granny! and how the others all stood around her, gazing with wondering admiration at her gold-bowed spectacles (for those she usually wore were of horn) and the large breastpin, with a weeping-willow displayed upon it, which fastened her kerchief. \"Made out of your grandfather's tail, did you say, Toto?\" said the bear, in an undertone. \"Astonishing!\" \"No, no, Bruin!\" cried the boy, half pettishly. \"Made out of his _hair_! Surely you might know by this time that we have no tails.\" \"True! true!\" murmured the bear, apologetically. \"I beg your pardon, Toto, boy. You are not really vexed with old Bruin?\" Toto rubbed his curly head affectionately against the shaggy black one, in token of amity, and the bear continued:-- \"When Madam was a young grandmother, was she as beautiful as she is now?\" \"Why, yes, I fancy so,\" replied Toto. \"Only she wasn't a grandmother then, you know.\" \"How so?\" inquired Bruin. \"What else could she be? You never were anything but a boy, were you?\" \"Oh, no, of course not!\" said Toto. \"But that is different. When Granny was young, she was a girl, you see.\" \"I don't believe it!\" said the bear, stoutly. \"I--do--_not_--believe it! I saw a girl once--many years ago; it squinted, and its hair was frowzy, and it wore a hideous basket of flowers on its head,--a dreadful creature! Madam never can have looked like _that_!\" At this moment a knock was heard at the door. Toto flew to open it, and with a beaming face ushered in the old hermit, who entered leaning on his stick, with his crow perched on one shoulder and the hawk on the other. Then, what greetings followed! What introductions! What bows and courtesies, and whisking of tails and flapping of wings! The hermit's bow in greeting to the old lady was so stately that Master <DW53> was consumed with a desire to imitate it; and in so doing, he stepped back against the nose of the tea-kettle and burned himself, which caused him to retire suddenly under the table with a",

It was their custom to dash the water in bucketfuls over the pavement, and then dance violently about, scrubbing with their feet as hard as they could.\" \"Oh, what fun!\" cried Toto. \"Mayn't we try it some day, Granny? I'll fasten four brushes to your feet, <DW53>, and you can scrub the floor every day.\" \"Thank you, kindly!\" said the raccoon. \"If you can get the brushes on my feet, I will pledge myself to dance in them. That is certainly fair.\" He winked slyly at Toto, while the grandmother continued:-- \"Alas! my son,\" said the old man, \"your father will wear out no more scrubbing-shoes. Listen! This morning, while we were all busily at work, it chanced through some evil fate that His Celestial Majesty felt a desire to taste the freshness of the morning air. Unannounced he came, with only the Princely Parasol-Holder, the Unique Umbrella-Opener, and seven boys to hold up his celestial train. You know that your father is slightly deaf? Yes. Well, he stood--my good friend Ly-Chee--he stood with his back to the palace. He heard not the noise of the opening door, and at the very moment when His Celestial Majesty stepped out into the court-yard, Ly-Chee cast a great bucketful of ice-cold water backward, with fatal force and precision.\" Chop-Chin shuddered, and hid his face in his hands. \"Picture to yourself the dreadful scene!\" continued the ancient sweeper. \"The Celestial Petticoat, of yellow satin damask, was drenched. The Celestial Shoes, of chicken-skin embroidered in gold, were reduced to a pulp. A shriek burst from every mouth!

It is a fine country, though too far from Africa for my taste.\" \"Tell us about your father, Miss Mary!\" exclaimed the squirrel. \"Fine old bird he must have been, eh?\" \"He was, indeed!\" replied the parrot, with some emotion. \"He was a noble bird. His beak, which I am said to have inherited, was the envy of every parrot in Central Africa. He could whistle in nine languages, and his tail--but as the famous poet Gabblio has sweetly sung,-- \"'All languages and tongues must fail, In speaking of Polacko's tail.' \"Polacko was my father's name,\" she explained. \"He was universally respected. Ah, me!\" \"But how came he to go to China?\" asked Toto. \"He was captured, my dear, and taken there when very young. He lived there for twenty years, with one of the chief mandarins of the empire. He led a happy life, with a perch and ring of ebony and silver, the freedom of the house, and chow-chow four times a day. At last, however, the young grandson of the mandarin insisted upon my father's learning to eat with chopsticks. The lofty spirit of Polacko could not brook this outrage, and the door being left open one day he flew away and made his way to Africa, the home of his infancy, where he passed the rest of his life. I drop a tear,\" added Miss Mary, raising her claw gracefully to her eyes, \"to his respected memory.\" Nobody saw the tear, but all looked grave and sympathetic, and the good-natured bear said, \"Quite right, I'm sure. Very proper, certainly!\" But now the grandmother rose and folded up her knitting. \"Dear friends, and Toto, boy,\" she said, \"it is bed-time, now, for the clock has struck nine. Good-night, and pleasant dreams to you all. My good Bruin, you will cover the fire, and lock up the house?\" \"Trust me for that, dear Madam!\" said the bear, heartily. \"Come, then, Cracker,\" said the old lady. \"Your basket is all ready for you, and it is high time you were in it.\" And with the squirrel perched on her shoulder she went into her own little room, closing the door behind her. After exchanging mutual \"good-nights,\" the other members of the family sought their respective sleeping-places. The birds flew to their perches, and each, tucking her head and one leg away in some mysterious manner, became suddenly a very queer looking creature indeed. \"<DW53>,\" said Toto, \"come and sleep on my bed, won't you?
