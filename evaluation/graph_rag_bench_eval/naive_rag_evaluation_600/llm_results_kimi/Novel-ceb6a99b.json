[_Softly to THE DEAN._] Oh Jedd, Jedd--and these are what you call Principles! Have you got the key of your handcuffs? THE DEAN. Yes. NOAH. [_Appearing in the doorway._] Time's oop. Coom on! THE DEAN. May I say a few parting words in the home I have apparently wrecked? NOAH. Say' em and 'a done. THE DEAN. In setting out upon a journey, the termination of which is problematical, I desire to attest that this erring constable is the husband of a wife from whom it is impossible to withhold respect, if not admiration. NOAH. You 'ear' im! THE DEAN. As for my wretched self, the confession of my weaknesses must be reserved for another time--another place. [_To GEORGIANA._] To you, whose privilege it is to shelter in the sanctity of the Deanery, I give this earnest admonition. Within an hour from this terrible moment, let the fire be lighted in the drawing-room--let the missing man's warm bath be waiting for its master--a change of linen prepared. Withhold your judgments. Wait. NOAH. This is none of your business. Coom on. THE DEAN. I am ready! [_NOAH takes him by the arm and leads him out._ GEORGIANA. Oh, what am I to think of my brother? HANNAH. [_Kneeling at GEORGIANA'S feet._] Think! That he's the beautifullest, sweetest man in all Durnshire! GEORGIANA. Woman! HANNAH. It's I and my whistle and Nick the fire-brigade horse what'll bring him back to the Deanery safe and unharmed. Not a soul but we three'll ever know of his misfortune. [_Listening._] Hark! They're off! NOAH. [_Outside._] Get up, now! Get-oop, old girl! HANNAH. [_With a cry._] Ah! [_Rushing to the door and looking out._] He's done for! GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM. Done for! HANNAH. The Dean can whistle himself blue! Noah's put Kitty in the cart, and left Old Nick at home! THE END OF THE FIRST SCENE. _The second scene is the Morning Room at the Deanery again._ _SALOME and SHEBA are sitting there gloomily._ SALOME. Poor Papa! SHEBA. Poor dear",

[_SHEBA laughs._ THE DEAN. [_Reprovingly._] Toy-child! GEORGIANA. Trust George Tidd for setting things quite square in a palace or a puddle. THE DEAN. George Tidd! Who is George Tidd? GEORGIANA. I am George Tidd--that was my racing name. Ask after George Tidd at Newmarket--they'll tell you all about me. My colors were crimson and black diamonds. There you are. [_Producing her pocket-handkerchief, which is crimson and black._ THE DEAN. Dear me! Very interesting! Georgiana, my dear. One moment, children. [_The girls go into the Library._ THE DEAN. [_Tapping the handkerchief._] I understand distinctly from your letter that all this is finally abandoned? GEORGIANA. Worse luck! They'll never see my colors at the post again! THE DEAN. And the contemplation of sport generally as a mental distraction----? GEORGIANA. Oh, yes--I dare say you'll manage to wean me from that, too, in time. THE DEAN. In time! Well, but--Georgiana! [_The gate bell is heard again, the girls re-enter._ GEORGIANA. There's a visitor. I'll tootle upstairs and have a groom down. [_To SALOME and SHEBA._] Make the running, girls. At what time do we feed, Augustin? THE DEAN. There is luncheon at one o'clock. GEORGIANA. Right. The air here is so fresh I sha'n't be sorry to get my nose-bag on. [_She stalks out, accompanied by the girls._ THE DEAN. My sister, Georgiana--my widowed sister, Georgiana. Dear me, I am quite disturbed. Surely, surely the serene atmosphere of the Deanery will work a change. It must! It must! If not, what a grave mistake I have made. Good gracious! No, no, I won't think of it! Still, it is a little unfortunate that poor Georgiana should arrive here on the very eve of these terrible races at St. Marvells. _BLORE enters with a card._ THE DEAN. Who is it, Blore? [_Reading the card._] \"Sir Tristram Mardon.\" Dear, dear! Certainly, Blore, certainly. [_BLORE goes out._] Mardon--why, Mardon and I haven't met since Oxford.

Beyond the ordinary risks of war they acted in full knowledge that capture by the enemy would mean the same fate as Austria meted out to the heroic Italian deputy, Cesare Battisti; and some of them, left wounded on the battle-field after a retreat, shot each other to avoid being taken alive. Throughout the Dobrudja campaign they fought with the most desperate gallantry against impossible odds, and, owing to inadequate support during the retreat, their main body was reduced from 15,000 to 4000. Latterly the other divisions had been withdrawn to recruit at Odessa, after sharing the defence of the Rumanian southern front. ‘To these men in the summer of 1916 Serbia had sent a certain number of higher officers, but, for equipment and medical help, they were dependent upon what the Russians could spare from their own almost unlimited needs. At the worst hour Dr. Inglis and her unit came to the help of the Jugoslavs, shared their privations and misfortunes, and spared no effort in their cause. ‘History will record the name of Elsie Inglis, like that of Lady Paget, as pre-eminent among that band of women who have redeemed for all time the honour of Britain in the Balkans. Among the Serbs it is already assuming an almost legendary quality. To us it will serve to remind us that Florence Nightingale will never be without successors among us. And in particular, every true Scotsman will cherish her memory, every believer in the cause for which she gave her life will gain fresh courage from her example. R. W. SETON-WATSON. CHAPTER IX SERBIA ‘Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children.’ ‘And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter. For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.’ ‘On either side of the river, was there the tree of life: And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.’ Dr. Inglis remained at home directing the many operations necessary to ensure the proper equipment of the units, and the difficult task of getting them conveyed overseas. From the beginning, till her return with her unit serving with the Serbian army in Russia, she had the sustaining co-operation both of the Admiralty and the Foreign Office. In the many complications surrounding the history of the hospitals with the Allied armies, the Scottish women owed very much to both Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, and very particularly to Lord Robert Cecil in his department of the Foreign Office. It was not easy to get the scheme of hospitals staffed entirely by women, serving abroad with armies fighting the common and unscrupulous foe, accepted",

Peacefully it flowed on still, with the little ferns growing, and the sheep nibbling beside it. We idle tourists alone occupied that solitary height where those long-past warlike races--one succeeding the other--lived and loved, fought and died. The chapel--where the high altar and a little burial-ground beside it can still be traced--is clearly much later than Arthur's time. However, there are so few data to go upon, and the action of sea-storms destroys so much every year, that even to the learned archaeologist, Tintagel is a great mystery, out of which the imaginative mind may evolve almost anything it likes. We sat a long time on the top of the rock--realising only the one obvious fact that our eyes were gazing on precisely the same scene, seawards and coastwards, that all these long-dead eyes were accustomed to behold. Beaten by winds and waves till the grey of its slate formation is nearly black; worn into holes by the constant action of the tide which widens yearly the space between it and the main-land, and gnaws the rock below into dangerous hollows that in time become sea-caves, Tintagel still remains--and one marvels that so much of it does still remain--a landmark of the cloudy time between legend and actual history. Whether the ruin on the opposite height was once a portion of Tintagel Castle, before the sea divided it, making a promontory into an island--or whether it was the Castle Terrabil, in which Gorlois, Ygrayne's husband, was slain--no one now can say. That both the twin fortresses were habitable till Elizabeth's time, there is evidence to prove. But since then they have been left to decay, to the silent sheep and the screeching ravens, including doubtless that ghostly chough, in whose shape the soul of King Arthur is believed still to revisit the familiar scene. We did not see that notable bird--though we watched with interest two tame and pretty specimens of its almost extinct species walking about in a flower-garden in the village, and superstitiously cherished there. We were told that to this day no Cornishman likes to shoot a chough or a raven. So they live and breed in peace among the twin ruins, and scream contentedly to the noisy stream which dances down the rocky hollow from Trevena, and leaps into the sea at Porth Hern--the \"iron gate,\" over against Tintagel. Otherwise, all is solitude and silence. We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel we found a party who had",
