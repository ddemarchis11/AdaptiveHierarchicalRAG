  "question": "How does Mr. Darbey's status as an officer of the Hussars relate to his being seen by The Dean and spoken to by Sheba?",
  "gold_answer": "The Dean sees Darbey, Mr. Darbey is an officer of the Hussars, Sheba speaks to Mr. Darbey.",
  "llm_answer": "Mr. Darbey’s status as an officer of the Hussars is the only reason the Dean is willing to receive him at all; when the Dean mistakes his name he still greets him courteously because he is “Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey … of the Hussars,” and Sheba, having announced the visitors in those terms, promptly corrects the Dean’s slip of the tongue—“Mr. Darbey!”—thus acknowledging his commission before conversation can proceed.",

A company had already been sent out, under the auspices of the Court management, to perform \"Dandy Dick\" in the provinces; but, when the play was withdrawn from the London boards, Mr. Clayton set out himself with a company, and it was during this tour that he died at Liverpool. In America Mr. Daly produced \"Dandy Dick\" with Miss Ada Rehan in Mrs. John Wood's part, but no very great success was achieved; whereas in Australia its reception was so enthusiastic that it ran for quite an unusual time both in Melbourne and Sydney. In the character of the Dean, Mr. G. W. Anson achieved perhaps the greatest of his Australian successes, and Mr. Robert Brough made his mark as the policeman. MALCOLM C. SALAMAK. _December_, 1892. DANDY DICK. THE FIRST ACT. _The morning-room in the Deanery of St. Marvells, with a large arched opening leading to the library on the right, and a deeply-recessed window opening out to the garden on the left. It is a bright spring morning, and an air of comfort and serenity pervades the place._ _SALOME, a tall, handsome, dark girl, of about three-and-twenty, is sitting with her elbows resting on her knees, staring wildly into vacancy. SHEBA, a fair little girl of about seventeen, wearing short petticoats, shares her despondency, and lies prostrate upon the settee._ SALOME. Oh! oh my! oh my! oh my! SHEBA. [_Sitting upright._] Oh, my gracious goodness, goodness gracious me! [_They both walk about excitedly._ SALOME. There's only one terrible word for it--it's a fix! SHEBA. It's worse than that! It's a scrape! How did you ever get led into it? SALOME. How did _we_ get led into it? Halves, Sheba, please. SHEBA. It was Major Tarver's proposal, and I believe, Salome, that it is to _you_ Major Tarver is paying attention. SALOME. The Fancy Dress Masked Ball at Durnstone is promoted by the Officers of the Hussars. I believe that the young gentleman you have impressed calls himself an officer, though he is merely a lieutenant. SHEBA. [_Indignantly._] Mr. Darbey is _certainly_ an officer--a small officer. How dare you gird at me, Salome? SALOME. Very well, then. When to-night we appear at the Durnstone Athenaeum, unknown to dear Papa, on the arms of Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey, I consider that we shall be equally wicked. Oh, how can we be so wrong? SHEBA. Well, we're not wrong",

Yes, Blore, dear, and hang your h's on the hat-stand. [BLORE _laughs sweetly at SHEBA and shakes his fingers at her playfully._ BLORE. [_Vindictively, behind their backs._] 'Ussies! [_He goes out._ SALOME. Am I all right, Sheba? SHEBA. Yes. Am I? SALOME. Yes. [_Looking out at window._] Here they are! How well Gerald Tarver dismounts! Oh! SHEBA. He left his liver in India, didn't he? SALOME. No--only part of it. SHEBA. Well--part of it. SALOME. And that he gave to his Queen, brave fellow! SHEBA. [_Seating herself in an artificial attitude._] Where shall we be--here? SALOME. [_Running to the piano._] All right; you be admiring my voice! SHEBA. Oh, I dare say! SALOME. Here they are, and we're doing nothing! SHEBA. Let's run away and then come in unconsciously. SALOME. Yes--unconsciously. [_They run off through the Library. BLORE shows in MAJOR TARVER and MR. DARBEY, who are both in regimentals. MAJOR TARVER is a middle-aged, tall, angular officer, with a thin face, yellow complexion, and red eyes. He is alternately in a state of great excitement and depression. MR. DARBEY is a mere boy, but with a pompous, patronizing manner._ DARBEY. The Dean's out of the way, eh! BLORE. Yes, sir, he his. TARVER. Eh? How is the Dean? Never mind--perhaps Miss Jedd is at home? BLORE. Yes, sir, she his. TARVER. It would be discourteous to run away without asking Miss Jedd after her father. DARBEY. [_Throwing himself on the settee._] Deuced bad form! BLORE. The ladies were 'ere a minute ago. [_SALOME and SHEBA walk in together. SALOME has her arm round her sister's waist and looks up to her with a sweet, trusting smile. They start in confusion on seeing TARVER and DARBEY._ SALOME. Major Tarver. SHEBA. Mr. Darbey. TARVER.

Delighted, my dear Dean--delighted! [_THE DEAN gives DARBEY a severe look, and with an important cough walks into the Library. The men and the girls speak in undertones._ TARVER.

[_THE DEAN sits at his desk in the Library._ DARBEY. Of course; when we're turned out we can hang about in the lane till you're ready. TARVER. Yes, but when are _we_ to make our preparations? It'll take me a long time to look like Charles the First! SHEBA. We can drive about Durnstone while you dress. SALOME. [_To TARVER, admiringly._] Charles the First! Oh, Major! DARBEY. That was my idea--Charles the Martyr, you know. Tarver's a martyr to his liver--see? SHEBA. Oh! sha'n't we all look magnificent? SALOME. Oh! TARVER. Grand idea--the whole thing! DARBEY.
