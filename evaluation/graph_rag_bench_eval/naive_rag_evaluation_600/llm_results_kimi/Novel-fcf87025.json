  "question": "Throughout the narrative of 'Pen Pictures,' what relationships does Roxie have with key political figures such as Governor Morock, as well as family or mentor figures like Ben Robertson and Aunt Patsy Perkins? Please detail Roxie's consultation with Gov. Morock regarding her legal and financial affairs, Gov. Morock's promise to 'pick up the crumbs' for her, how Roxie was taught penmanship by Ben Robertson during her schooling, and her interactions and thoughts involving Aunt Patsy Perkins.",
  "gold_answer": "Roxie consulted Gov. Morock, Gov. Morock was to pick up the crumbs for Roxie, she was taught the art of penmanship by Ben Robertson, was visited by Aunt Patsy Perkins, and thought of Aunt Patsy.",
  "llm_answer": "Roxie’s ties to each of the three figures are quite specific and limited to the moments shown in the text.\n\n1. Governor Morock  \n   - She consults him only after she has been told “everything is positively lost … you are left hopelessly destitute.”  \n   - Morock’s advice is that, since every court-case has gone against her, the only remaining “loop-hole” is for her to let him manufacture a false “shadow” marriage that will “marry her off” and give her a new claim.  \n   - When she refuses that scheme he switches to a second offer: he will “pick up the crumbs” by using Federal-army contacts to seize two-or-three-hundred bales of cotton (worth ~$400 each) from the Simon plantations.  \n   - He names his price: “I’ll pick up the crumbs for half,” meaning a fifty-fifty split. Roxie answers, “Do the best you can,” and leaves. That single interview is the whole of their recorded relationship.\n\n2. Ben Robertson  \n   - No present-time contact occurs. Roxie merely pauses before beginning her letter and, in silent gratitude, “thank(s) from the bottom of her heart old Ben Robertson, who in the country school had taught her the art of penmanship.” He is remembered only as her early writing teacher, nothing more.\n\n3. Aunt Patsy Perkins  \n   - Aunt Patsy is a social caller at the Daymon palace, not a relative of Roxie’s.  \n   - Their talk is one-way: Aunt Patsy airs her grievances about her husband’s “dratted poor kin” and vows to “make it hot for old Perkins,” while Roxie offers almost no comment except to remind Aunt Patsy that young Jim is “kinsfolk on your side of the house.”  \n   - After the visit Roxie “thought no more of her,” and the narrative explicitly states that Roxie died “as ignorant of the fate of her sister as the stone that now stands upon her grave.” Thus Aunt Patsy is merely a passing acquaintance, not a continuing mentor or family figure to Roxie.",

The ever wakeful eye of the Angel of observation is peering into the parlor of the Daymon _palace_, to see Roxie surrounded with all the luxuries of furniture, sitting by an ornamented table, upon which lay gilt-edged paper; in the center of the table sat a pearl ink-stand and a glass ornament set with variegated colors. Roxie's forehead rested upon the palm of her left hand, elbow on the table. Profound reflections are passing through her brain; they carry her back to the days of her childhood. Oh, how she loved Suza; the little bright eyes gazed upon her and the red lips pronounced the inaudible sound, “_dear sister_.” “Yes, I will write,” said Roxie, mentally. She takes the gold pen in her right hand, adjusting the paper with her left, she _paused_ to thank from the bottom of her heart old Ben Robertson, who in the country school had taught her the art of penmanship. _Hush!_ did the hall bell ring? In a few minutes a servant appeared at the door and announced the name of Aunt Patsy Perkins. “Admit Aunt Patsy--tell her your mistress is at home,” said Roxie, rising from the table. Aunt Patsy Perkins was floating upon the surface of upper-tendom in Chicago. She understood all of the late styles; a queen in the drawing-room, understood the art precisely of entertaining company; the grandest ladies in the city would listen to the council of Aunt Patsy, for she could talk faster and more of it than any woman west of the Alleghany Mountains. The visitor enters the room; Roxie offers Aunt Patsy an easy chair; Aunt Patsy is wiping away the perspiration with a fancy kerchief, in one hand, and using the fan with the other. When seated she said: “I must rest a little, for I have something to tell you, and I will tell you now what it is before I begin. Old Perkins has no more love for style than I have for his _dratted poor kin_. But as I was going to tell you, Perkins received a letter from Indiana, stating this Cousin Sally wished to make us a visit. She's a plain, poor girl, that knows no more of style than Perkins does of a woman's comforts. I'll tell you what it is, Mrs. Daymon, if she does come, if I don't make it hot for old Perkins, it'll be because I can't talk. A woman has nothing but her tongue, and while I live I will use mine.” Then pointing her index finger at Roxie, continued:",

      "text": "the God's truth, so far as I know it. Now make a clean breast of it, Conway, and let us hear your pedigree,” said Brindle, confidentially. “I was born in Tennessee. My father's name was Cæsar Simon, and I bear his name. My mother's name was Nancy Wade. I do not remember either of them I was partly raised by my sisters, and the balance of the time I have tried to raise myself, but it seems it will take me a Iong time to _make a raise_--” at this point, Brindle interfered in breathless suspense, with the inquiry, “Did you have an uncle named S. S. Simon?” “I have heard my sister say as much,” continued Simon. “Then your dream is interpreted,” said Brindle, emphatically. “Your Uncle, S. S. Simon, has left one of the largest estates in Arkansas, and now you are on the steam wagon again,” said Brindle, slapping his companion on the shoulder. Brindle had been instructed by his mother, and made Cousin Cæsar acquainted with the outline of all the history detailed in this narrative, except the history of Roxie Daymon _alias_ Roxie Fairfield, in Chicago. The next day the two men were hired as hands to go down the river on a flat-bottom boat. Roxie Daymon, whose death has been recorded, left an only daughter, now grown to womanhood, and bearing her mother's name. Seated in the parlor of one of the descendants of Aunt Patsy Perkins, in Chicago, we see her sad, and alone; we hear the hall bell ring. A servant announces the name of Gov. Morock. “Show the Governor up,” said Roxie, sadly. The ever open ear of the Angel of observation has only furnished us with the following conversation: “Everything is positively lost, madam, not a cent in the world. Every case has gone against us, and no appeal, madam. You are left hopelessly destitute, and penniless. Daymon should have employed me ten years ago--but now, it is too late. Everything is gone, madam,” and the Governor paused. “My mother was once a poor, penniless girl, and I can bear it too,” said Roxie, calmly. “But you see,” said the Governor, softening his voice; “you are a handsome young lady; your fortune is yet to be made. For fifty dollars, madam, I can fix you up a _shadow_, that will marry you off. You see the law has some _loop holes_ and--and in your case, madam, it is no harm to take one; no harm, no harm, madam,” and the Governor paused again. Roxie looked at the man sternly, and said: “I have no further use for a",

A woman has nothing but her tongue, and while I live I will use mine.” Then pointing her index finger at Roxie, continued: “I will tell you what it is Mrs. Daymon, take two white beans out of one hull, and place them on the top of the garden fence, and then look at 'em across the garden, and if you can tell which one is the largest, you can seen what difference there is in the way old Perkins hates style and I hate his _dratted poor kin_. What wealthy families are to do in this city, God only knows. I think sometimes old Perkins is a _wooden man_, for, with all my style, I can make no more impression on h-i-m, than I can upon an oak stump, Mrs. Daymon. What if he did make a thousand dollars last week, when he wants to stick his _poor kin_ 'round me, like stumps in a flower garden.” At this point Roxie ventured to say a word. “Aunt Patsy, I thought Jim was kinsfolk on your side of the house.” “Yes, but honey, I am good to Jim, poor soul, he knows it,” said Aunt Patsy gravely, and then she paused. Jim was a poor boy, eighteen years old, and the son of Aunt Patsy's dear brother, long since laid under the dark green sod of Indiana. The poor boy, hearing of the wealth of his Aunt Patsy, had come to Chicago and was working on the streets, poorly clad. Aunt Patsy would sometimes give him a few dollars, as you would throw a bone to a dog, requesting him at the same time to always come to the back door, and never be about the house when she had company. Aunt Patsy said emphatically, as she left the Daymon palace, “I'll tell you what it is, Mrs. Daymon, I'm goin' home to study human nature, and if I don't find some avenue to reach old Perkim, I shall take the liberty to insult the first one of his _dratted poor kin_ that sets foot in my house.” After Aunt Patsy left, Roxie thought no more of her letter of inquiry, and company engaged her attention for some days until the subject passed entirely out of her mind. Soon after these events Roxie died with the cholera--leaving an only daughter--and was buried as ignorant of the fate of her sister as the stone that now stands upon her grave. We must now turn back more than a decade, which brings us to the burning of the steamboat Brandywine, on the Mississippi river. The boat was heavily freighted, with a large number of passengers on",

Leave that to me, if you please,” and in a softer tone of voice the Governor continued, “you ought to pick up the _crumbs_, madam, pick up the crumbs.” “I would like to do so for I have never spent a cent in the prospect of the estate, though my credit is good for thousands in this city.. I want to see how a dead man's shoes will fit before I wear them,” said Roxie, sadly. “Good philosophy, madam, good philosophy,” said the Governor, and continued to explain. “There is cotton on the bank of the river at the Simon plantations. Some arrangement ought to be made, and I think I could do it through some officer of the federal army,” said the Governor, rubbing his hand across his forehead, and continued, “that's what I mean by picking up the crumbs, madam.” “_How much?_” said Roxie, preparing to leave the office. “I m always liberal, madam, always liberal. Let me see; it is attended with some difficulty; can't leave the city; too much business pressing (rubbing his hands); well--well--I will pick up the crumbs for half. Think I can secure two or three hundred bales of cotton, madam,” said the Governor, confidentially. “How much is a bale of cotton worth?” said Roxie, affecting ignorance. “Only four hundred dollars, madam; nothing but a crumb--nothing but a crumb, madam,” said the Governor, in a tone of flattery. “Do the best you can,” said Roxie, in a confidential tone, as she left the office.
