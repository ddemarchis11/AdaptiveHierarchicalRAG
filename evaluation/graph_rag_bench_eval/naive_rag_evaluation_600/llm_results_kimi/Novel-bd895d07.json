  "gold_answer": "The stomach prepares food, and food is carried by blood.",
  "llm_answer": "The stomach turns the chewed food into a gray fluid by mixing it with gastric juice. Once the food is in this liquid form, the blood picks it up and carries it to every part of the body, delivering the materials needed for growth and energy.",

      "text": "however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is changing the starch into sugar. All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva may be able to mix with it. Otherwise, the starch may not be changed; and if one part of your body neglects its work, another part will have more than its share to do. That is hardly fair. If you swallow your food in a hurry and do not let the saliva do its work, the stomach will have extra work. But it will find it hard to do more than its own part, and, perhaps, will complain. It can not speak in words; but will by aching, and that is almost as plain as words. SWALLOWING. Next to the chewing, comes the swallowing. Is there any thing wonderful about that? We have two passages leading down our throats. One is to the lungs, for breathing; the other, to the stomach, for swallowing. Do you wonder why the food does not sometimes go down the wrong way? The windpipe leading to the lungs is in front of the other tube. It has at its top a little trap-door. This opens when we breathe and shuts when we swallow, so that the food slips over it safely into the passage behind, which leads to the stomach. If you try to speak while you have food in your mouth, this little door has to open, and some bit of food may slip in. The windpipe will not pass it to the lungs, but tries to force it back. Then we say the food chokes us. If the windpipe can not succeed in forcing back the food, the person will die. HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY. But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down into the stomach. There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric juice, until it is all a gray fluid. Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which leads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into the blood. The blood carries it to the heart. The heart pumps it out with the blood into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle, and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain. Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner can help to mend any parts that may be broken. Suppose a boy should break one of the bones of his arm, how could it be mended? If you should bind together the two parts of a broken stick and leave them a while, do you think they would grow together? No, indeed! But the doctor could carefully bind together the ends of the broken bone in the boy's arm and leave it for awhile, and the blood would bring it bone food every day, until it had grown together again. So a dinner can both make and mend the different parts of the body. REVIEW",

[Illustration: H]ERE, at last, is the bill of fare for our dinner:           Roast beef,           Potatoes,           Tomatoes,           Squash,           Bread,           Butter,           Salt,           Water,           Peaches,           Bananas,           Oranges,           Grapes. What must be done first, with the different kinds of food that are to make up this dinner? The meat, vegetables, and bread must be cooked. Cooking prepares them to be easily worked upon by the mouth and stomach. If they were not cooked, this work would be very hard. Instead of going on quietly and without letting us know any thing about it, there would be pains and aches in the overworked stomach. The fruit is not cooked by a fire; but we might almost say the sun had cooked it, for the sun has ripened and sweetened it. When you are older, some of you may have charge of the cooking in your homes. You must then remember that food well cooked is worth twice as much as food poorly cooked. \"A good cook has more to do with the health of the family, than a good doctor.\" THE SALIVA. Next to the cooking comes the eating. As soon as we begin to chew our food, a juice in the mouth, called saliva (sa l[=i]'va), moistens and mixes with it. Saliva has the wonderful power of turning starch into sugar; and the starch in our food needs to be turned into sugar, before it can be taken into the blood. You can prove for yourselves that saliva can turn starch into sugar. Chew slowly a piece of dry cracker. The cracker is made mostly of starch, because wheat is full of starch. At first, the cracker is dry and tasteless. Soon, however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is changing the starch into sugar. All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva may be able to mix with it. Otherwise, the starch may not be changed; and if one part of your body neglects its",

As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the body. These tubes are called arteries (aer't[)e]r iz). Those tubes which bring the blood back again to the heart, are called veins (v[=a]nz). You can see some of the smaller veins in your wrist. If you press your finger upon an artery in your wrist, you can feel the steady beating of the pulse. This tells just how fast the heart is pumping and the blood flowing. The doctor feels your pulse when you are sick, to find out whether the heart is working too fast, or too slowly, or just right. Some way is needed to send the gray fluid that is made from the food we eat and drink, to every part of the body. To send the food with the blood is a sure way of making it reach every part. So, when the stomach has prepared the food, the blood takes it up and carries it to every part of the body. It then leaves with each part, just what it needs. THE BLOOD AND THE BRAIN. As the brain has so much work to attend to, it must have very pure, good blood sent to it, to keep it strong. Good blood is made from good food. It can not be good if it has been poisoned with alcohol or tobacco. We must also remember that the brain needs a great deal of blood. If we take alcohol into our blood, much of it goes to the brain. There it affects the nerves, and makes a man lose control over his actions. EXERCISE. When you run, you can feel your heart beating. It gets an instant of rest between the beats. Good exercise in the fresh air makes the heart work well and warms the body better than a fire could do. DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE HEART? Your heart is made of muscle. You know what harm alcohol does to the muscles. Could a fatty heart work as well as a muscular heart? No more than a fatty arm could do the work of a muscular arm. Besides, alcohol makes the heart beat too fast, and so it gets too tired. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. Where is the heart placed?           2. Of what is it made?           3.
