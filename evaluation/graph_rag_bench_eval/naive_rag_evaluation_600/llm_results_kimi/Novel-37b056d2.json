  "gold_answer": "Judge Boompointer and Judge Fletcher were rumored to be rivals for Miss Trotter's hand.",
  "llm_answer": "Because, after Mr. Calton left, Miss Trotter suddenly became more receptive to masculine attention; society noticed her drawing the marked attentions of both Judge Boompointer and Judge Fletcher, so gossip quickly cast the two judges as rivals for her hand.",

Among the orders she received was the notification that Mr. Calton's rooms would be vacated the next day. When the servant, who, like most of her class, was devoted to the good-natured, good-looking, liberal Chris, asked with some concern if the young gentleman was no better, Miss Trotter, with equal placidity, answered that it was his intention to put himself under the care of a specialist in San Francisco, and that she, Miss Trotter, fully approved of his course. She finished her letter,--the servant noticed that it was addressed to Mr. Bilson at Paris,--and, handing it to her, bade that it should be given to a groom, with orders to ride over to the Summit post-office at once to catch the last post. As the housekeeper turned to go, she again referred to the departing guest. \"It seems such a pity, ma'am, that Mr. Calton couldn't stay, as he always said you did him so much good.\" Miss Trotter smiled affably. But when the door closed she gave a hysterical little laugh, and then, dropping her handsome gray-streaked head in her slim hands, cried like a girl--or, indeed, as she had never cried when a girl. When the news of Mr. Calton's departure became known the next day, some lady guests regretted the loss of this most eligible young bachelor. Miss Trotter agreed with them, with the consoling suggestion that he might return for a day or two. He did return for a day; it was thought that the change to San Francisco had greatly benefited him, though some believed he would be an invalid all his life. Meantime Miss Trotter attended regularly to her duties, with the difference, perhaps, that she became daily more socially popular and perhaps less severe in her reception of the attentions of the masculine guests. It was finally whispered that the great Judge Boompointer was a serious rival of Judge Fletcher for her hand. When, three months later, some excitement was caused by the intelligence that Mr. Bilson was returning to take charge of his hotel, owing to the resignation of Miss Trotter, who needed a complete change, everybody knew what that meant. A few were ready to name the day when she would become Mrs. Boompointer; others had seen the engagement ring of Judge Fletcher on her slim finger. Nevertheless Miss Trotter married neither, and by the time Mr. and Mrs. Bilson had returned she had",

Nevertheless Miss Trotter married neither, and by the time Mr. and Mrs. Bilson had returned she had taken her holiday, and the Summit House knew her no more. Three years later, and at a foreign Spa, thousands of miles distant from the scene of her former triumphs, Miss Trotter reappeared as a handsome, stately, gray-haired stranger, whose aristocratic bearing deeply impressed a few of her own countrymen who witnessed her arrival, and believed her to be a grand duchess at the least. They were still more convinced of her superiority when they saw her welcomed by the well-known Baroness X., and afterwards engaged in a very confidential conversation with that lady. But they would have been still more surprised had they known the tenor of that conversation. \"I am afraid you will find the Spa very empty just now,\" said the baroness critically. \"But there are a few of your compatriots here, however, and they are always amusing. You see that somewhat faded blonde sitting quite alone in that arbor? That is her position day after day, while her husband openly flirts or is flirted with by half the women here. Quite the opposite experience one has of American women, where it's all the other way, is it not? And there is an odd story about her which may account for, if it does not excuse, her husband's neglect. They're very rich, but they say she was originally a mere servant in a hotel.\" \"You forget that I told you I was once only a housekeeper in one,\" said Miss Trotter, smiling. \"Nonsense. I mean that this woman was a mere peasant, and frightfully ignorant at that!\" Miss Trotter put up her eyeglass, and, after a moment's scrutiny, said gently, \"I think you are a little severe. I know her; it's a Mrs. Bilson.\" \"No, my dear. You are quite wrong. That was the name of her FIRST husband. I am told she was a widow who married again--quite a fascinating young man, and evidently her superior--that is what is so funny. She is a Mrs. Calton--'Mrs. Chris Calton,' as she calls herself.\" \"Is her husband--Mr. Calton--here?\" said Miss Trotter after a pause, in a still gentler voice. \"Naturally not. He has gone on an excursion with a party of ladies to the Schwartzberg. He returns to-morrow. You will find HER very stupid, but HE is very jolly, though a little spoiled by women. Why do we always spoil them?\" Miss Trotter smiled, and presently turned the subject. But the baroness was greatly disappointed to find the next",

For all that, Miss Trotter had never looked so charming, and the faint autumnal glow in her face made no one regret her passing summer. One evening she found Chris so much better that he was sitting on the balcony, but still so depressed that she was compelled so far to overcome the singular timidity she had felt in his presence as to ask him to come into her own little drawing-room, ostensibly to avoid the cool night air. It was the former \"card-room\" of the hotel, but now fitted with feminine taste and prettiness. She arranged a seat for him on the sofa, which he took with a certain brusque boyish surliness, the last vestige of his youth. \"It's very kind of you to invite me in here,\" he began bitterly, \"when you are so run after by every one, and to leave Judge Fletcher just now to talk to me, but I suppose you are simply pitying me for being a fool!\" \"I thought you were imprudent in exposing yourself to the night air on the balcony, and I think Judge Fletcher is old enough to take care of himself,\" she returned, with the faintest touch of coquetry, and a smile which was quite as much an amused recognition of that quality in herself as anything else. \"And I'm a baby who can't,\" he said angrily. After a pause he burst out abruptly: \"Miss Trotter, will you answer me one question?\" \"Go on,\" she said smilingly. \"Did you know--that--woman was engaged to Bilson when I spoke to you in the wood?\" \"No!\" she answered quickly, but without the sharp resentment she had shown at his brother's suggestion. \"I only knew it when Mr. Bilson told me the same evening.\" \"And I only knew it when news came of their marriage,\" he said bitterly. \"But you must have suspected something when you saw them together in the wood,\" she responded. \"When I saw them together in the wood?\" he repeated dazedly. Miss Trotter was startled, and stopped short. Was it possible he had not seen them together? She was shocked that she had spoken; but it was too late to withdraw her words. \"Yes,\" she went on hurriedly, \"I thought that was why you came back to say that I was not to speak to her.\" He looked at her fixedly, and said slowly: \"You thought that? Well, listen to me. I saw NO ONE! I knew nothing of this! I suspected nothing! I returned before I had reached the wood--because--because--I had changed my mind!\" \"Changed your mind!\" she repeated wonderingly. \"Yes! Changed my mind! I couldn't stand it any longer! I did not love the girl--I never loved",

This is what brought me here,\" she said, holding out the silver medal. \"I came across it just now in the Bowery. The name was the same, and I thought it just possible Mr. Lockwood would like to have it; or, to tell you the truth, that he might tell me what had become of the Henry Burgoyne who gave it to him.\" Young Latimer had the medal in his hand before she had finished speaking, and was examining it carefully. He looked up with just a touch of color in his cheeks and straightened himself visibly. \"Please don't be offended,\" said the fair collector. \"I know what you think. You've heard of my stupid collection, and I know you think I meant to add this to it. But, indeed, now that I have had time to think--you see I came here immediately from the pawnshop, and I was so interested, like all collectors, you know, that I didn't stop to consider. That's the worst of a hobby; it carries one rough-shod over other people's feelings, and runs away with one. I beg of you, if you do know anything about the coin, just to keep it and don't tell me, and I assure you what little I know I will keep quite to myself.\" Young Latimer bowed, and stood looking at her curiously, with the medal in his hand. \"I hardly know what to say,\" he began slowly. \"It really has a story. You say you found this on the Bowery, in a pawnshop. Indeed! Well, of course, you know Mr. Lockwood could not have left it there.\" Miss Catherwaight shook her head vehemently and smiled in deprecation. \"This medal was in his safe when he lived on Thirty-fifth Street at the time he was robbed, and the burglars took this with the rest of the silver and pawned it, I suppose. Mr. Lockwood would have given more for it than any one else could have afforded to pay.\" He paused a moment, and then continued more rapidly: \"Henry Burgoyne is Judge Burgoyne. Ah! you didn't guess that? Yes, Mr. Lockwood and he were friends when they were boys. They went to school in Westchester County. They were Damon and Pythias and that sort of thing. They roomed together at the State college and started to practise law in Tuckahoe as a firm, but they made nothing of it, and came on to New York and began reading law again with Fuller & Mowbray. It was while they were at school that they had these medals made. There was a mate to this, you know; Judge Burgoyne had it. Well, they continued to live and work together. They were both",

But, alas! in her frantic desire to reach the moon she overshot the mark; jumped clear over it, and went down on the other side, nobody knows where, and she never was seen or heard of again. And Mother Brindle, when she saw what had happened, ran straight home and gobbled up the warm mash before any of the other cows could get there, and ate so fast that she made herself ill. \"That is the whole story,\" said the squirrel, seriously; \"and it seemed to me a very curious one, I confess.\" \"Very!\" said Toto, dryly. \"But there's nothing about the others in it,--the cat and fiddle, and the little dog, you know.\" \"Well, they _weren't_ in it really, at all!\" replied Cracker. \"They were all lies, Mrs. Cow says, every one of them.\" \"Humph!\" said Toto \"Well, Mrs. Cow ought to be a good judge of lies, I should say.\" \"What can be expected,\" said the raccoon loftily, \"from a creature who eats hay? Be good enough to hand me those nuts, Toto, will you? The story has positively made me hungry,--a thing that has not happened--\" \"Since dinner-time!\" said Toto. \"Wonderful indeed, <DW53>! But I shall hand the nuts to Cracker first, for he has told us a very good story, whether it is true or not.\" CHAPTER XI. THE apples and nuts went round again and again, and for a few minutes nothing was heard save the cracking of shells and the gnawing of sharp white teeth. At length the parrot said, meditatively:-- \"That was a very stupid cow, though! Are all cows as stupid as that?\" \"Well, I don't think they are what you would call brilliant, as a rule,\" Toto admitted; \"but they are generally good, and that is better.\" \"Hem! possibly!\" said Miss Mary, dryly. \"That is probably why we have no cows in Central Africa. Our animals being all, without exception, clever _and_ good, there is really no place for creatures of the sort you describe.\" \"How about the bogghun, Miss Mary?\" asked the raccoon, slyly, with a wink at Toto. The parrot ruffled up her feathers, and was about to make a sharp reply; but suddenly remembering the raccoon's brave defence of her an hour before, she smoothed her plumage again, and replied gently,-- \"I confess that I forgot the bogghun, <DW53>. It is indeed a treacherous and a wicked creature!--a dark blot on the golden roll of African animals.\" She paused and sighed, then",
