The other fishes, always chasing me, seemed distracted by the newcomers. I kept close to the rocks at Lizard, wary of both humans and my fellow fish.",

Not the moon-footed ones with their crooked spears and laughing breath, but the *big* ones—those who ride the surface in hollow logs and carry thunder in their pockets.\n\nI was burrowed deep, tail tucked in the cool sand just above the waterline, when the darkness of my cave began to *breathe*. First, a slit of daylight widened where the roof meets the sea, and the water—my quiet, heaving cradle—started to *rock*. Not the usual tug of tide, but a shiver, like when the moon pulls too hard and the whole world sways.\n\nThen came the *shadow*. A great mouth of wood, rimmed with faces. They floated in, silent at first, their eyes round as urchins. One of them—small, voice like a gull—whispered, *“I don’t like this at all.”* I felt the same. Their oars stirred the sand where my cousins lay hidden; grains of my ceiling rained down like snow.\n\nThey stopped *right above me*. I froze, silver side pressed to the sand, heart beating in my throat. One of them raised a stick—no, a *tube*—and suddenly the cave *roared*. The sound cracked the walls, rolled through the tunnels, chased itself into the black places where even I dare not swim. My bones rattled. The little ones clapped their hands over their ears; the big ones laughed, but it was the kind of laugh that isn’t joy—it’s *power*. They think they own the echo.\n\nThey left before the next wave. The slit of sky narrowed, the water calmed, but the thunder stayed behind, humming in the stones. I wriggled out, checked my tail—still there—and darted deeper, past the starfish that never speak, past the old crab who remembers when the cave had no roof at all.\n\nTonight I will not gleam. I will tuck myself under a shadowed ledge where the moon’s fingers can’t pet me. Let the two-legs keep their thunder. The cave is mine when they are gone. The dark remembers me.\n\n—Launce",

You are apt either to chop him right in two, or miss him altogether, when off he wriggles in the sand and disappears. My young people say it requires a practised hand and a peculiar twist of the wrist, to have any success at all in launce fishing. It can only be done on moonlight nights--the full moon and a day or two after--and they are out half the night. They go about barefoot, which is much safer than soaked shoes and stockings. About midnight they light a fire on the sand, cook all the fish they have caught, and have a grand supper, as they had last night. They came home as merry as crickets about two o'clock this morning. Perhaps you might not have noticed what a wonderful moonlight night it was?\" I had; but it would not have occurred to me to spend it in standing for hours up to the knees in salt water, catching unfortunate fish. However, tastes differ, and launce-fishing may be a prime delight to some people; so I faithfully chronicle it, and the proper mode of pursuing it, as one of the attractions at the Lizard. I am not aware that it is practised at any other part of the Cornish coast, nor can I say whether or not it was a pastime of King Arthur and his Knights. One cannot imagine Sir Tristram or Sir Launcelot occupied in spearing a small sand-eel. The bathing at Housel Cove was delightful as ever. And afterwards we saw that very rare and beautiful sight, a perfect solar rainbow. Not the familiar bow of Noah, but a great luminous circle round the sun, like the halo often seen round the moon, extending over half the sky; yellow at first, then gradually assuming faint prismatic tints. This colouring, though never so bright as the ordinary arched rainbow, was wonderfully tender and delicate. We stood a long time watching it, till at last it melted slowly out of the sky, leaving behind a sense of mystery, as of something we had never seen before and might never see again in all our lives. It was a lovely day, bright and warm as midsummer, tempting us to some distant excursion; but we had decided to investigate the Lizard Lights. We should have been content to take them for granted, in their purely poetical phase, as we had watched them night after night. But some of us were blessed with scientific relatives, who would have despised us utterly if we had spent a whole week at the Lizard and never gone to see the Lizard Lights. So we felt bound to do our duty, and admire, if we could not understand. Which we certainly did not. I chronicle with shame that the careful and courteous explanations",

Directly after breakfast--and we are people who never vary from our eight o'clock breakfast, so that we always see the world in its early morning brightness and freshness--we went \"Brushing with hasty steps the dew away,\" along the fields, which led down to Housel or Househole Cove. Before us, clear in the sunshine, rose the fine headland of Penolver, and the green <DW72>s of the amphitheatre of Belidden, supposed to be the remains of a Druidical temple. That, and the chair of Belidden, a recess in the rock, whence there is a splendid view, with various archaeological curiosities, true or traditionary, we ought to have examined, I know. But--we didn't do it. Some of us were content to rejoice in the general atmosphere of beauty and peace without minute investigation, and some of us were so eminently practical that \"a good bathe\" appeared more important than all the poetry and archaeology in the world. So we wandered slowly on, rejoicing at having the place all to ourselves, when we came suddenly upon a tall black figure intently watching three other black figures, or rather dots, which were climbing slowly over Penolver. It was our clerical friend of Kynance; with whom, in the natural and right civility of holiday-makers, we exchanged a courteous good morning. [Illustration: THE LION ROCKS--A SEA IN WHICH NOTHING CAN LIVE.] \"Yes, those are my girls up on the cliff there. They have been bathing, and are now going to walk to Cadgwith.\" \"Then nobody fell into the Devil's Throat at Kynance? They all came back to you with whole limbs?\" \"Yes,\" said he smiling, \"and they went again for another long walk in the afternoon. At night, when it turned out to be such splendid moonlight, they actually insisted on going launce-fishing. Of course you know about launce-fishing?\" I pleaded my utter ignorance of that noble sport. \"Oh, it is _the_ thing at the Lizard. My boys--and girls too--consider it the best fun going. The launce is a sort of sand-eel peculiar to these coasts. It swims about all day, and at night burrows in the sand just above the waterline, where, when the moon shines on it, you can trace the silvery gleam of the creature. So you stand up to your ankles on wet sand, with a crooked iron spear which you dart in and hook him up, keeping your left hand free to seize him with.\" \"Easy fishing,\" said I, with a certain pity for the sand-eel. \"Not so easy as appears.

Its high-vaulted roof and sides were tinted all colours--rose-pink, rich dark brown, and purple. The entrance was wide enough to admit a boat, but it gradually narrowed into impenetrable darkness. How far inland it goes no one can tell, as it could only be investigated by swimming, a rather dangerous experiment. Boats venture as far as the daylight goes; and it is a favourite trick of the boatman suddenly to fire off a pistol, which reverberates like thunder through the mysterious gloom of the cave. A solemn place; an awful place, some of us thought, as we rowed in, and out again, into the sunshiny open sea. Which we had now got used to; and it was delicious to go dancing like a feather up and down, trusting to John Curgenven's stout arm and fearless, honest face. We felt sad to think this would be our last sight of him and of the magnificent Lizard coast. But the minutes were lessening, and we had some way still to row. Also to land, which meant a leap between the waves upon slippery sea-weedy rocks. In silent dread I watched my children accomplish this feat, and then-- Well, it is over, and I sit here writing these details. But I would not do it again, not even for the pleasure of revisiting Dolor Ugo and having a row with John Curgenven. Honest fellow! he looked relieved when he saw \"the old lady\" safe on _terra firma_, and we left him waving adieux, as he \"rocked in his boat in the bay.\" May his stout arms and kindly heart long remain to him! May his summer tourists be many and his winter shipwrecks few! I am sure he will always do his duty, and see that other people do theirs, or, like the proverbial Cornishmen, he \"will know the reason why.\" Charles was ready; waiting patiently in front of a blacksmith's shop. But, alas! fate had overtaken us in the shape of an innocent leak in John Curgenven's boat; nothing, doubtless, to him, who was in the habit of baling it out with his boots, and then calmly putting them on again, but a little inconvenient to us. To drive thirty miles with one's garments soaked up to the knees was not desirable. There was a cottage close by, whence came the gleam of a delicious fire and the odour of ironing clothes. We went in: the mistress, evidently a laundress, advanced and offered to dry us--which she did, chattering all the while in the confidential manner of country folks. A hard working, decent body she was, and as for her house, it was a perfect",

Which resulted in our carrying away with us the biggest bunches in the whole vinery, as well as a quantity of rosy apples, stuffed into every available pocket and bag. \"Nonsense, nonsense,\" was the answer to vain remonstrances. \"D'ye think I wouldn't give the best of everything I had to your family? and so would my missis too. How your father used to laugh at me about my little maid! But he understood it for all that. Oh yes, I'm glad I came home. And now your father and your uncle are home too, and perhaps some day they'll come to see me down here--wouldn't it be a proud day for me! You'll tell them so?\" It was touching, and rare as touching, this passionate personal fidelity. It threw us back, at least such of us as were sentimentally inclined, upon that something in Cornish nature which found its exposition in Arthur and his faithful knights, down to \"bold Sir Bedevere,\" and apparently, is still not lost in Cornwall. With a sense of real regret, feeling that it would be long ere we might meet his like--such shrewd simplicity, earnest enthusiasm, and exceeding faithfulness--we bade good-bye to the honest man; leaving him and his wife standing at their garden-gate, an elderly Adam and Eve, desiring nothing outside their own little paradise. Which of us could say more, or as much? Gratefully we \"talked them over,\" as we drove on through the pretty country round Helstone--inland country; for we had no time to go and see the Loe Pool, a small lake, divided from the sea by a bar of sand. This is supposed to be the work of the Cornwall man-demon, Tregeagle; and periodically cut through, with solemn ceremonial, by the Mayor of Helstone, when the \"meeting of the waters,\" fresh and salt, is said to be an extremely curious sight. But we did not see it, nor yet Nonsloe House, close by, which is held by the tenure of having to provide a boat and nets whenever the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Cornwall wishes to fish in the Loe Pool. A circumstance which has never happened yet, certainly! Other curiosities _en route_ we also missed, the stones of Tremenkeverne, half a ton each, used as missiles in a notable fight between two saints, St. Just of the Land's End, and St. Keverne of the Lizard, and still lying in a field to prove the verity of the legend.

Hold on, mate, the boat will go right into the cave.\" And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them; while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from which no one could ever hope to come out alive. \"I don't like this at all,\" said a small voice. \"Hadn't we better get out again?\" practically suggested another. But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to return; and begged for \"only five minutes\" in that wonderful place, compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as nothing. They were beautiful, but this was terrible. Yet with its terror was mingled an awful delight. \"Give me but five, nay, two minutes more!\" \"Very well, just as you choose,\" was the response of meek despair. So of course, Poetry yielded. The boatmen were told to row on into daylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic overhanging cliffs permitted. And never, never, never in this world shall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave. But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself on my memory with an almost painful vividness. However, I promised not to regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not. I did see it, for just a glimpse; and that will serve. Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in quiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building dating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff, and with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude Haven on the other. Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild September sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited country which lie between Tintagel and Launceston. In the midst of it, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round and pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about half-a-mile off. \"There, ladies, that's King Arthur's grave.\" The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of. These varied records of the hero's last resting-place remind one of the three heads, said to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little boy, one as a young man, and the",
