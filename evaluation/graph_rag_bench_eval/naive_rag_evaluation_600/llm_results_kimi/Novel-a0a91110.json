  "question": "What is the relationship between the British Museum’s collection of cymbals and the musical instrument santir?",
  "gold_answer": "The British Museum has cymbals used by Egyptian musicians; Assyrian musicians played the dulcimer, known as santir.",
  "llm_answer": "The British Museum’s collection includes cymbals, which are part of the broader category of musical instruments. The santir, a type of dulcimer, is also mentioned in the context of musical instruments. While the text does not explicitly link the British Museum’s cymbals to the santir, both are part of the historical development of musical instruments. The santir is noted as a predecessor to the dulcimer and, by extension, to the pianoforte, illustrating the evolution of instruments. The cymbals, as part of the museum’s collection, represent another example of ancient musical artifacts, though no direct relationship between the two is specified in the text.  \n\n\\boxed{The British Museum’s cymbals and the santir are both part of the historical collection of musical instruments, but no direct relationship is stated in the text.}",

      "text": "About a thousand years ago when this monochord was in use the musical scale was diatonic, with the exception of the interval of the seventh, which was chromatic inasmuch as both _b-flat_ and _b-natural_ formed part of the scale. The notation on the preceding page exhibits the compass as well as the order of intervals adhered to about the tenth century. This ought to be borne in mind in examining the representations of musical instruments transmitted to us from that period. As regards the wind instruments popular during the middle ages, some were of quaint form as well as of rude construction. The _chorus_, or _choron_, had either one or two tubes, as in the woodcut page 101. There were several varieties of this instrument; sometimes it was constructed with a bladder into which the tube is inserted; this kind of _chorus_ resembled the bagpipe; another kind resembled the _poongi_ of the Hindus, mentioned page 51. The name _chorus_ was also applied to certain stringed instruments. One of these had much the form of the _cithara_, page 86. It appears however, probable that _chorus_ or _choron_ originally designated a horn (Hebrew, _Keren_; Greek, _Keras_; Latin, _cornu_). [Illustration] The flutes of the middle ages were blown at the end, like the flageolet. Of the _syrinx_ there are extant some illustrations of the ninth and tenth centuries, which exhibit the instrument with a number of tubes tied together, just like the Pandean pipe still in use. In one specimen engraved (page 102) from a manuscript of the eleventh century the tubes were inserted into a bowl-shaped box. This is probably the _frestele_, _fretel_, or _fretiau_, which in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was in favour with the French ménétriers. Some large Anglo-saxon trumpets may be seen in a manuscript of the eighth century in the British museum. The largest kind of trumpet was placed on a stand when blown. Of the _oliphant_, or hunting horn, some fine specimens are in the South Kensington collection. The _sackbut_ (of which we give a woodcut) probably made of metal, could be drawn out to alter the pitch of sound. The sackbut of the ninth century had, however, a very different shape to that in use about three centuries ago, and much more resembled the present _trombone_. The name _sackbut_ is supposed to be a corruption of _sambuca_. The French, about the fifteenth century, called it _sacqueboute_ and _saquebutte_.

Thus also the improvements which have been made during the present century in the construction of our brass instruments, and the invention of several new brass instruments, have evidently been not without influence upon the conceptions displayed in our modern orchestral works. Imperfect though this essay may be it will probably have convinced the reader that a reference to the history of the music of different nations elucidates many facts illustrative of our own musical instruments, which to the unprepared observer must appear misty and impenetrable.

At the present day instruments of the harmonium class have become such universal favourites in western Europe as almost to compete with the pianoforte. Several other well-authenticated instances could be cited in which one instrument has suggested the construction of another of a superior kind. The prototype of our pianoforte was evidently the dulcimer, known at an early time to the Arabs and Persians who call it _santir_. One of the old names given to the dulcimer by European nations is _cimbal_. The Poles at the present day call it _cymbaly_, and the Magyars in Hungary _cimbalom_. The _clavicembalo_, the predecessor of the pianoforte, was in fact nothing but a _cembalo_ with a key-board attached to it; and some of the old _clavicembali_, still preserved, exhibit the trapezium shape, the round hole in the middle of the sound-board, and other peculiarities of the first dulcimer. Again, the gradual development of the dulcimer from a rude contrivance, consisting merely of a wooden board across which a few strings are stretched, is distinctly traceable by a reference to the musical instruments of nations in different stages of civilization. The same is the case with our highly perfected harp, of which curious specimens, representing the instrument in its most primitive condition, are still to be found among several barbarous tribes. We might perhaps infer from its shape that it originally consisted of nothing more than an elastic stick bent by a string. The Damaras, a native tribe of South-western Africa, actually use their bow occasionally as a musical instrument, when they are not engaged in war or in the chase. They tighten the string nearly in the middle by means of a leathern thong, whereby they obtain two distinct sounds, which, for want of a sound-board, are of course very weak and scarcely audible to anyone but the performer. Some neighbouring tribes, however, possess a musical instrument very similar in appearance to the bow, to which they attach a gourd, hollowed and open at the top, which serves as a sound-board. Again, other African tribes have a similar instrument, superior in construction only inasmuch as it contains more than one string, and is provided with a sound-board consisting of a suitable piece of sonorous wood. In short, the more improved we find these contrivances the closer they approach our harp. And it could be shown if this were requisite for our present purpose that much the same gradual progress towards perfection, which we observe in the African harp, is traceable in the harps of several nations in different parts of the world. Moreover, a collection of musical instruments deserves the attention of the ethnologist",

Each tube has a separate mouth-piece and six finger-holes, five of which are at the upper side and one is underneath. The _syrinx_, or Pandean pipe, had from three to nine tubes, but seven was the usual number. The straight trumpet, _salpinx_, and the curved horn, _keras_, made of brass, were used exclusively in war. The small hand-drum, called _tympanon_, resembled in shape our tambourine, but was covered with parchment at the back as well as at the front. The _kymbala_ were made of metal, and resembled our small cymbals. The _krotala_ were almost identical with our castanets, and were made of wood or metal. THE ETRUSCANS AND ROMANS. The Romans are recorded to have derived some of their most popular instruments originally from the Etruscans; a people which at an early period excelled all other Italian nations in the cultivation of the arts as well as in social refinement, and which possessed musical instruments similar to those of the Greeks. It must, however, be remembered that many of the vases and other specimens of art which have been found in Etruscan tombs, and on which delineations of lyres and other instruments occur, are supposed to be productions of Greek artists whose works were obtained from Greece by the Etruscans, or who were induced to settle in Etruria. The flutes of the Etruscans were not unfrequently made of ivory; those used in religious sacrifices were of box-wood, of a species of the lotus, of ass’ bone, bronze and silver. A bronze flute, somewhat resembling our flageolet, has been found in a tomb; likewise a huge trumpet of bronze. An Etruscan _cornu_ (engraved) is deposited in the British museum, and measures about four feet in length. [Illustration] To the Etruscans is also attributed by some the invention of the hydraulic organ. The Greeks possessed a somewhat similar contrivance which they called _hydraulos_, _i.e._ water-flute, and which probably was identical with the _organum hydraulicum_ of the Romans. The instrument ought more properly to be regarded as a pneumatic organ, for the sound was produced by the current of air through the pipes; the water applied serving merely to give the necessary pressure to the bellows and to regulate their action. The pipes were probably caused to sound by means of stops, perhaps resembling those on our organ, which were drawn out or pushed in. The construction was evidently but a primitive contrivance, contained in a case which could be carried by one or two persons",
