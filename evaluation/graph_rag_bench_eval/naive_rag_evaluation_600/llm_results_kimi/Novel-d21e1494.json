  "question": "In the context of the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER's explanation of skin and perspiration, why can wearing rubber boots indoors cause the pores on your feet to become clogged, and what effects does this have on comfort and health?",
  "gold_answer": "Rubber boots can cause the pores on your feet to become clogged.",
  "llm_answer": "Rubber boots do not let perspiration escape, so the sweat stays inside and clogs the pores on your feet. This makes your feet feel uncomfortable and can give you a headache.",

Because under the outside skin is the true skin, which is so full of little nerves that it will feel the least touch as pain. When the outer skin, which protects it, is torn away, we must cover the true skin to keep it from harm. In hot weather, or when any one has been working or playing hard, the face, and sometimes the whole body, is covered with little drops of water. We call these drops perspiration (p[~e]r sp[)i] r[=a]'sh[)u]n). [Illustration: _Perspiratory tube._] Where does it come from? It comes through many tiny holes in the skin, called pores (p[=o]rz). Every pore is the mouth of a tiny tube which is carrying off waste matter and water from your body. If you could piece together all these little perspiration tubes that are in the skin of one person, they would make a line more than three miles long. Sometimes, you can not see the perspiration, because there is not enough of it to form drops. But it is always coming out through your skin, both in winter and summer. Your body is kept healthy by having its worn-out matter carried off in this way, as well as in other ways. THE NAILS. The nails grow from the skin. The finger nails are little shields to protect the ends of your fingers from getting hurt. These finger ends are full of tiny nerves, and would be badly off without such shields. No one likes to see nails that have been bitten. CARE OF THE SKIN. Waste matter is all the time passing out through the perspiration tubes in the skin. This waste matter must not be left to clog up the little openings of the tubes. It should be washed off with soap and water. When children have been playing out-of-doors, they often have very dirty hands and faces. Any one can see, then, that they need to be washed. But even if they had been in the cleanest place all day and had not touched any thing dirty, they would still need the washing; for the waste matter that comes from the inside of the body is just as hurtful as the mud or dust of the street. You do not see it so plainly, because it comes out very little at a time. Wash it off well, and your skin will be fresh and healthy, and able to do its work. If the skin could not do its work, you would die. Do not keep on your rubber boots or shoes all through school-time. Rubber will not let the perspiration pass off, so the little pores get clogged and your feet begin to feel uncomfortable, or your head may ache. No part can fail to do its work without causing trouble to the rest of the body. But you should always wear rubbers out-of-doors",

No part can fail to do its work without causing trouble to the rest of the body. But you should always wear rubbers out-of-doors when the ground is wet. Certainly, they are very useful then. When you are out in the fresh air, you are giving the other parts of your body such a good chance to perspire, that your feet can bear a little shutting up. But as soon as you come into the house, take the rubbers off. Now that you know what the skin is doing all the time, you will understand that the clothes worn next to your skin are full of little worn-out particles, brought out by the perspiration. When these clothes are taken off at night, they should be so spread out, that they will air well before morning. Never wear any of the clothes through the night, that you have worn during the day. Do not roll up your night-dress in the morning and put it under your pillow. Give it first a good airing at the window and then hang it where the air can reach it all day. By so doing, you will have sweeter sleep at night. You are old enough to throw the bed-clothes off from the bed, before leaving your rooms in the morning. In this way, the bed and bed-clothes may have a good airing. Be sure to give them time enough for this. WORK OF THE BODY. You have now learned about four important kinds of work:-- 1st. The stomach prepares the food for the blood to take. 2d. The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of the body, and to take away worn-out matter. 3d. The lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and pure again. 4th. The skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration tubes. All this work goes on, day and night, without our needing to think about it at all; for messages are sent to the muscles by the nerves which keep them faithfully at work, whether we know it or not. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. What covers the body?           2. What lines the body?           3. Where are the nerves of the skin?           4. What is perspiration? What is the common name           for it?           5. What are the pores of the skin?           6. How does the perspiration help to keep you",

Name the four kinds of work about which you           have learned.           15. How are the organs of the body kept at work? CHAPTER XVII. THE SENSES. [Illustration: W]E have five ways of learning about all things around us. We can see them, touch them, taste them, smell them, or hear them. Sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing, are called the five senses. You already know something about them, for you are using them all the time. In this lesson, you will learn a little more about seeing and hearing. THE EYES. In the middle of your eye is a round, black spot, called the pupil. This pupil is only a hole with a muscle around it. When you are in the light, the muscle draws up, and makes the pupil small, because you can get all the light you need through a small opening. When you are in the dark, the muscle stretches, and opens the pupil wide to let in more light. The pupils of the cat's eyes are very large in the dark. They want all the light they can get, to see if there are any mice about. [Illustration: _The eyelashes and the tear-glands._] The pupil of the eye opens into a little, round room where the nerve of sight is. This is a safe place for this delicate nerve, which can not bear too much light. It carries to the brain an account of every thing we see.",

      "text": "may breathe in cold air; but that which you breathe out is warm. A great deal of heat from your warm body is all the time passing off through your skin, into the cooler air about you. For this reason, a room full of people is much warmer than the same room when empty. CLOTHING. We put on clothes to keep in the heat which we already have, and to prevent the cold air from reaching our skins and carrying off too much heat in that way. Most of you children are too young to choose what clothes you will wear. Others decide for you. You know, however, that woolen under-garments keep you warm in winter, and that thick boots and stockings should be worn in cold weather. Thin dresses or boots may look pretty; but they are not safe for winter wear, even at a party. A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes which are suitable for the season, is pleasanter to look at than one whose dress, though rich and handsome, is not warm enough for health or comfort. When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible. This will make the hot blood flow all through your body and warm it. If you can not, you should put on more clothes, go to a warm room, in some way get warm and keep warm, or the cold will make you sick. TAKING COLD. If your skin is chilled, the tiny mouths of the perspiration tubes are sometimes closed and can not throw out the waste matter. Then, if one part fails to do its work, other parts must suffer. Perhaps the inside skin becomes inflamed, or the throat and lungs, and you have a cold, or a cough. ALCOHOL AND COLD. People used to think that nothing would warm one so well on a cold day, as a glass of whiskey, or other alcoholic drink. It is true that, if a person drinks a little alcohol, he will feel a burning in the throat, and presently a glowing heat on the skin. The alcohol has made the hot blood rush into the tiny tubes near the skin, and he thinks it has warmed him. But if all this heat comes to the skin, the cold air has a chance to carry away more than usual. In a very little time, the drinker will be colder than before. Perhaps he will not know it; for the cheating alcohol will have deadened his nerves so that they send no message to the brain. Then he may not have sense enough to put on more clothing and may freeze. He may even, if it is very cold, freeze to death. People, who have not been drinking alcohol are sometimes frozen; but they would have frozen much quicker if they had drunk it. Horse-car drivers and omnibus drivers have a hard time on a cold winter day. They are often cheated into thinking that alcohol will keep them warm; but doctors have learned that it is the water-drinkers who hold",
