  "question": "What is the reasoning path from Heckshill to Mr. Tarbox’s interaction with Brice?",
  "gold_answer": "Heckshill wrote to Mr. Tarbox; Mr. Tarbox didn't answer Brice.",
  "llm_answer": "1. Heckshill’s polite letter after seeing the newspaper paragraph tells Tarbox he didn’t know Tarbox was “a well-known citizen” and asks him to recommend timber land.  \n2. Tarbox, seizing the chance to look respectable, sells Heckshill half of his own quarter-section and begins styling himself a land-agent.  \n3. This new, “respectable” business identity makes Tarbox determined to break all connection with Snapshot Harry’s gang and with anyone (Brice) who might remind people of that past.  \n4. Therefore, when Brice sends letters to Flora by way of Tarbox, Tarbox refuses to deliver them, tells Brice he has “chucked your letter in the fire,” and ends the former friendly dealings—an abrupt change that is the direct scene of interaction between Tarbox and Brice.",

For the first time he looked around the room curiously. \"I didn't know you were a land agent before,\" he said. \"No more I was! All that kem out o' that paragraph, Mr. Brice. That man Heckshill, who was so mighty perlite that night, wrote to me afterwards that he didn't know my name till he'd seed that paragraph, and he wanted to know ef, ez a 'well-known citizen,' I could recommend him some timber lands. I recommended him half o' my own quarter section, and he took it. He's puttin' up a mill thar, and that's another reason why we want peace and quietness up thar. I'm tryin' (betwixt and between us, Mr. Brice) to get Harry to cl'ar out and sell his rights in the valley and the water power on the Fork to Heckshill and me. I'm opening a business here.\" \"Then you've left Mrs. Tarbox with Miss Flora in your cabin while you attend to business here,\" said Brice tentatively. \"Not exactly, Mr. Brice. The old woman thought it a good chance to come to 'Frisco and put Flo in one o' them Catholic convent schools--that asks no questions whar the raw logs come from, and turns 'em out first-class plank all round. You foller me, Mr. Brice? But Mrs. Tarbox is jest in the next room, and would admire to tell ye all this--and I'll go in and send her to you.\" And with a patronizing wave of the hand, Mr. Tarbox complacently disappeared in the hall. Mr. Brice was not sorry to be left to himself in his utter bewilderment! Flo, separated from her detrimental uncle, and placed in a convent school! Tarbox, the obscure pioneer, a shrewd speculator emerging into success, and taking the uncle's place! And all this within that month which he had wasted with absurd repinings. How feeble seemed his own adventure and advancement; how even ludicrous his pretensions to any patronage and superiority. How this common backwoodsman had set him in his place as easily as SHE had evaded the advances of the journalist and Heckshill! They had taught him a lesson; perhaps even the sending back of his handkerchief was part of it! His heart grew heavy; he walked to the window and gazed out with a long sigh. A light laugh, that might have been an echo of the one which had attracted him that night in Tarbox's cabin, fell upon his ear. He turned quickly to meet Flora Dimwood's laughing eyes shining upon",

Then there was more talk, and the discovery that Mr. Brice was long due at the office. \"Ye might drop in, now and then, whenever ye feel like it, and Flo is at home,\" suggested Mrs. Tarbox at parting. Mr. Brice DID drop in frequently during the next month. On one of these occasions Mr. Tarbox accompanied him to the door. \"And now--ez everything is settled and in order, Mr. Brice, and ef you should be wantin' to say anything about it to your bosses at the office, ye may mention MY name ez Flo Dimwood's second cousin, and say I'm a depositor in their bank. And,\" with greater deliberation, \"ef anything at any time should be thrown up at ye for marryin' a niece o' Snapshot Harry's, ye might mention, keerless like, that Snapshot Harry, under the name o' Henry J. Dimwood, has held shares in their old bank for years!\" A TREASURE OF THE REDWOODS PART I Mr. Jack Fleming stopped suddenly before a lifeless and decaying redwood-tree with an expression of disgust and impatience. It was the very tree he had passed only an hour before, and he now knew he had been describing that mysterious and hopeless circle familiar enough to those lost in the woods. There was no mistaking the tree, with its one broken branch which depended at an angle like the arm of a semaphore; nor did it relieve his mind to reflect that his mishap was partly due to his own foolish abstraction. He was returning to camp from a neighboring mining town, and while indulging in the usual day-dreams of a youthful prospector, had deviated from his path in attempting to make a short cut through the forest. He had lost the sun, his only guide, in the thickly interlaced boughs above him, which suffused though the long columnar vault only a vague, melancholy twilight. He had evidently penetrated some unknown seclusion, absolutely primeval and untrodden. The thick layers of decaying bark and the desiccated dust of ages deadened his footfall and invested the gloom with a profound silence. As he stood for a moment or two, irresolute, his ear, by this time attuned to the stillness, caught the faint but distinct lap and trickle of water. He was hot and thirsty, and turned instinctively in that direction. A very few paces brought him to a fallen tree; at the foot of its upturned roots gurgled the spring whose upwelling stream had slowly but persistently loosened their hold on the soil, and worked their ruin. A pool of cool and clear water, formed by the disruption of the soil, overflowed, and after a few yards sank again in the",

But when he reached the summit he could see that the outline of the street was still plainly marked along the distance by cottages and new suburban villa-like blocks of houses. No. 1101 was in one of these blocks, a small tenement enough, but a palace compared to Mr. Tarbox's Sierran cabin. He impetuously rang the bell, and without waiting to be announced dashed into the little drawing-room and Mr. Tarbox's presence. That had changed too; Mr. Tarbox was arrayed in a suit of clothes as new, as cheaply decorative, as fresh and, apparently, as damp as his own drawing room. \"Did you get my letter? Did you give her the one I inclosed? Why didn't you answer?\" burst out Brice, after his first breathless greeting. Mr. Tarbox's face here changed so suddenly into his old dejected doggedness that Brice could have imagined himself back in the Sierran cabin. The man straightened and bowed himself at Brice's questions, and then replied with bold, deliberate emphasis: \"Yes, I DID get your letter. I DIDN'T give no letter o' yours to her. And I didn't answer your letter BEFORE, for I didn't propose to answer it AT ALL.\" \"Why?\" demanded Brice indignantly. \"I didn't give her your letter because I didn't kalkilate to be any go-between 'twixt you and Snapshot Harry's niece. Look yar, Mr. Brice. Sense I read that 'ar paragraph in that paper you gave me, I allowed to myself that it wasn't the square thing for me to have any more doin's with him, and I quit it. I jest chucked your letter in the fire. I didn't answer you because I reckoned I'd no call to correspond with ye, and when I showed ye that trail over to Harry's camp, it was ended. I've got a house and business to look arter, and it don't jibe with keepin' company with 'road agents.' That's what I got outer that paper you gave me, Mr. Brice.\" Rage and disgust filled Brice at the man's utter selfishness and shameless desertion of his kindred, none the less powerfully that he remembered the part he himself had played in concocting the paragraph. \"Do you mean to say,\" he demanded passionately, \"that for the sake of that foolish paragraph you gave up your own kindred? That you truckled to the mean prejudices of your neighbors and kept that poor, defenseless girl from the only honest roof she could find refuge under? That you dared to destroy my letter to her, and made her believe I was as selfish and ungrateful as yourself?\" \"Young feller,\" said Mr. Tarbox still more deliberately,",

Not in the style o' that land-grabber Heckshill, nor that peart newspaper man, neither. Of course I gave them as good as they sent,\" she went on, with a little laugh, but Brice could see that her sensitive lip in profile had the tremulous and resentful curve of one who was accustomed to slight and annoyance. Was it possible that this reckless, self-contained girl felt her position keenly? \"I am proud to have your good opinion,\" he said, with a certain respect mingled with his admiring glance, \"even if I have not your uncle's.\" \"Oh, he likes you well enough, or he wouldn't have hearkened to you a minute,\" she said quickly. \"When you opened out about them greenbacks, I jes' clutched my cheer SO,\" she illustrated her words with a gesture of her hands, and her face actually seemed to grow pale at the recollection,--\"and I nigh started up to stop ye; but that idea of Yuba Bill bein' robbed TWICE I think tickled him awful. But it was lucky none o' the gang heard ye or suspected anything. I reckon that's why he sent me with you,--to keep them from doggin' you and askin' questions that a straight man like you would be sure to answer. But they daren't come nigh ye as long as I'm with you!\" She threw back her head and rose-crested hat with a mock air of protection that, however, had a certain real pride in it. \"I am very glad of that, if it gives me the chance of having your company alone,\" returned Brice, smiling, \"and very grateful to your uncle, whatever were his reasons for making you my guide. But you have already been that to me,\" and he told her of the footprints. \"But for you,\" he added, with gentle significance, \"I should not have been here.\" She was silent for a moment, and he could only see the back of her head and its heavy brown coils. After a pause she asked abruptly, \"Where's your handkerchief?\" He took it from his pocket; her ingenious uncle's bullet had torn rather than pierced the cambric. \"I thought so,\" she said, gravely examining it, \"but I kin mend it as good as new. I reckon you allow I can't sew,\" she continued, \"but I do heaps of mendin', as the digger squaw and Chinamen we have here do only the coarser work. I'll send it back to you,",

It was by 'trucklin'' to them 'mean prejudices,' and readin' that thar 'foolish paragraph,' that I settled this thing then and thar!\" Brice's revulsion of sentiment was so complete, and the gratitude that beamed in his eyes was so sincere, that Mr. Tarbox hardly needed the profuse apologies which broke from him. \"Forgive me!\" he continued to stammer, \"I have wronged you, wronged HER--everybody. But as you know, Mr. Tarbox, how I have felt over this, how deeply--how passionately\"-- \"It DOES make a man <DW38> sometimes,\" said Mr. Tarbox, relaxing into demure dryness again, \"so I reckon you DID!
