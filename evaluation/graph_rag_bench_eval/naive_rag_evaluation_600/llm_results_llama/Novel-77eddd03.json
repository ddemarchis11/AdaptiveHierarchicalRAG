Those who drink brandy, rum, whiskey, or gin, get more alcohol, because those liquors are nearly one half alcohol. You may wonder that people wish to use such poisonous drinks at all. But alcohol is a deceiver. It often cheats the man who takes a little, into thinking it will be good for him to take more. Sometimes the appetite which begs so hard for the poison, is formed in childhood. If you eat wine-jelly, or wine-sauce, you may learn to like the taste of alcohol and thus easily begin to drink some weak liquor. The more the drinker takes, the more he often wants, and thus he goes on from drinking cider, wine, or beer, to drinking whiskey, brandy, or rum. Thus drunkards are made. People who are in the habit of taking drinks which contain alcohol, often care more for them than for any thing else, even when they know they are being ruined by them. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. How does alcohol look?           2. How does alcohol burn?           3. What will alcohol do to a dead body?           4. What drinks contain a little alcohol?           5. What drinks are about one half alcohol?           6. How does alcohol cheat people?           7. When is the appetite sometimes formed?           8. Why should you not eat wine-sauce or           wine-jelly?           9. How are drunkards made? CHAPTER VIII. TOBACCO. [Illustration: A] FARMER who had been in the habit of planting his fields with corn, wheat, and potatoes, once made up his mind to plant tobacco instead. Let us see whether he did any good to the world by the change. The tobacco plants grew up as tall as a little boy or girl, and spread out broad, green leaves. By and by he pulled the stalks, and dried the leaves. Some of them he pressed into cakes of tobacco; some he rolled into cigars; and some he ground into snuff. If you ask what tobacco is good for, the best answer will be, to tell you what it will do to a man or boy who uses it, and then let you answer the question for yourselves. Tobacco contains something called nicotine (n[)i]k'o t[)i]n). This is a strong poison.",

But a cider, wine, or beer-drinker often drinks so much more of the weaker liquor, that he gets a great deal of alcohol. People are often made drunkards by drinking cider or beer. The more poison, the more danger. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. Where have you ever seen distilling going on?           2. How can you distill water?           3.

[Illustration: A]LCOHOL looks like water, but it is not at all like water. Alcohol will take fire, and burn if a lighted match is held near it; but you know that water will not burn. When alcohol burns, the color of the flame is blue. It does not give much light: it makes no smoke or soot; but it does give a great deal of heat. A little dead tree-toad was once put into a bottle of alcohol. It was years ago, but the tree-toad is there still, looking just as it did the first day it was put in. What has kept it so? It is the alcohol. The tree-toad would have soon decayed if it had been put into water. So you see that alcohol keeps dead bodies from decaying. Pure alcohol is not often used as a drink. People who take beer, wine, and cider get a little alcohol with each drink. Those who drink brandy, rum, whiskey, or gin, get more alcohol, because those liquors are nearly one half alcohol.

DISTILLING. [Illustration: D]ISTILLING (d[)i]s t[)i]l[\\l]'ing) may be a new word to you, but you can easily learn its meaning. You have all seen distilling going on in the kitchen at home, many a time. When the water in the tea-kettle is boiling, what comes out at the nose? Steam. What is steam? You can find out what it is by catching some of it on a cold plate, or tin cover. As soon as it touches any thing cold, it turns into drops of water. When we boil water and turn it into steam, and then turn the steam back into water, we have distilled the water. We say vapor instead of steam, when we talk about the boiling of alcohol. It takes less heat to turn alcohol to vapor than to turn water to steam; so, if we put over the fire some liquid that contains alcohol, and begin to collect the vapor as it rises, we shall get alcohol first, and then water. But the alcohol will not be pure alcohol; it will be part water, because it is so ready to mix with water that it has to be distilled many times to be pure. But each time it is distilled, it will become stronger, because there is a little more alcohol and a little less water. In this way, brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are distilled, from wine, cider, and the liquors which have been made from corn, rye, or barley. The cider, wine, and beer had but little alcohol in them. The brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are nearly one-half alcohol. A glass of strong liquor which has been made by distilling, will injure any one more, and quicker, than a glass of cider, rum, or beer.

The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku lar) walls. Every time we breathe, these walls have to move. The muscles of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you breathe. All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is directed by the nerves. You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so you are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs. Is alcohol a help to them? REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1.

You can see where the outside skin and the lining skin meet at your lips. There is a thin outside layer of skin which we can pull off without hurting ourselves; but I advise you not to do so.

      "text": "say: \"Now, I can not make my grape-jelly, for the grape-juice is spoiled.\" WHAT IS THIS CHANGE IN THE GRAPE-JUICE? The sugar in the grape-juice is changing into something else. It is turning into alcohol and a gas[A] that moves about in little bubbles in the liquid, and rising to the top, goes off into the air. The alcohol is a thin liquid which, mixed with the water, remains in the grape-juice. The sugar is gone; alcohol and the bubbles of gas are left in its place. This alcohol is a liquid poison. A little of it will harm any one who drinks it; much of it would kill the drinker. Ripe grapes are good food; but grape-juice, when its sugar has turned to alcohol, is not a safe drink for any one. It is poisoned by the alcohol. WINE. This changed grape-juice is called wine. It is partly water, partly alcohol, and it still has the grape flavor in it. Wine is also made from currants, elderberries, and other fruits, in very much the same way as from grapes. People sometimes make it at home from the fruits that grow in their own gardens, and think there is no alcohol in it, because they do not put any in. But you know that the alcohol is made in the fruit-juice itself by the change of the sugar into alcohol and the gas. [Illustration] It is the nature of alcohol to make the person who takes a little of it, in wine, or any other drink, want more and more alcohol. When one goes on, thus taking more and more of the drinks that contain alcohol, he is called a drunkard. In this way wine has made many drunkards. Alcohol hurts both the body and mind. It changes the person who drinks it. It will make a good and kind person cruel and bad; and will make a bad person worse. Every one who takes wine does not become a drunkard, but you are not sure that you will not, if you drink it. You should not drink wine, because there is alcohol in it. CIDER. Cider is made from apples. In a few hours after the juice is pressed out of the apples, if it is left open to the air the sugar begins to change. Like the sugar in the grape, it changes into alcohol and bubbles of gas. At first, there is but little alcohol in cider, but a little of this poison is dangerous. More alcohol is all the time forming until in ten cups of cider there may be one cup of alcohol. Cider often makes its drinkers ill-tempered and cross. Cider and wine will turn into vinegar if left in a warm place long enough. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. What two things are in all fruit-juices?",
