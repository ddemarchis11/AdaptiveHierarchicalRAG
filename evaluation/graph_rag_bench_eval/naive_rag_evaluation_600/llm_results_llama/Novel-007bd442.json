Last of all, you should have seen the dear old grandmother, the beloved Madam, with her snowy curls and cap and kerchief; and the ebony stick which generally lived in a drawer and silver paper, and only came out on great occasions. How proud Toto was of his Granny! and how the others all stood around her, gazing with wondering admiration at her gold-bowed spectacles (for those she usually wore were of horn) and the large breastpin, with a weeping-willow displayed upon it, which fastened her kerchief. \"Made out of your grandfather's tail, did you say, Toto?\" said the bear, in an undertone. \"Astonishing!\" \"No, no, Bruin!\" cried the boy, half pettishly. \"Made out of his _hair_! Surely you might know by this time that we have no tails.\" \"True! true!\" murmured the bear, apologetically. \"I beg your pardon, Toto, boy. You are not really vexed with old Bruin?\" Toto rubbed his curly head affectionately against the shaggy black one, in token of amity, and the bear continued:-- \"When Madam was a young grandmother, was she as beautiful as she is now?\" \"Why, yes, I fancy so,\" replied Toto. \"Only she wasn't a grandmother then, you know.\" \"How so?\" inquired Bruin. \"What else could she be? You never were anything but a boy, were you?\" \"Oh, no, of course not!\" said Toto. \"But that is different. When Granny was young, she was a girl, you see.\" \"I don't believe it!\" said the bear, stoutly. \"I--do--_not_--believe it! I saw a girl once--many years ago; it squinted, and its hair was frowzy, and it wore a hideous basket of flowers on its head,--a dreadful creature! Madam never can have looked like _that_!\" At this moment a knock was heard at the door. Toto flew to open it, and with a beaming face ushered in the old hermit, who entered leaning on his stick, with his crow perched on one shoulder and the hawk on the other. Then, what greetings followed! What introductions! What bows and courtesies, and whisking of tails and flapping of wings! The hermit's bow in greeting to the old lady was so stately that Master <DW53> was consumed with a desire to imitate it; and in so doing, he stepped back against the nose of the tea-kettle and burned himself, which caused him to retire suddenly under the table with a",

Granny will think you are gone, after all.\" And catching the bear by the ear, he led him back in triumph to the cottage-door, crying, \"Granny, Granny! here he is! Now give him a good scolding, please, for frightening us so.\" But the grandmother never scolded. She only stroked the shaggy black fur, and said, \"Bruin, dear! my good, faithful, true-hearted Bruin! I could not bear to think that you had left me without saying good-by. That hurt me very much. But you would not have done it, would you, Bruin? We ought to have known you better.\" The bear looked about him distractedly, and bit his paw severely, as if to relieve his feelings. \"Yes I would!\" he cried. \"At least, if I meant to say good-by. I wouldn't say it, because I couldn't. But I don't mean to say it,--I mean I don't mean to do it. If you don't want me in the house,--being large and clumsy, as I am well aware, and ugly too,--I can sleep out by the pump, and come in to do the work. But I cannot leave the boy, please, dear Madam, nor you. And the calf wants attention, and that pig _ought_ to be swung at least once a week, and--and--\" But there was no need of further speech, for Toto's arms were clinging round his neck, and Toto's voice was shouting exclamations of delight; and the grandmother was shaking his great black paw, and calling him her best friend, her dearest old Bruin, and telling him that he should never leave them. And, in fact, he never did leave them. He settled down quietly in the little cottage, and washed and churned, baked and brewed, milked the cow and kept the pig in order. Happy was the good bear, and happy was Toto, in those pleasant days. For every afternoon, when the work was done, they welcomed one or all of their forest friends; or else they sought the green, beloved forest themselves, and sat beside the fairy pool, and wandered in the cool green mazes where all was sweetness and peace, with rustle of leaves and murmur of water, and chirp of bird and insect. But evening found them always at the cottage door again, bringing their woodland joyousness to the blind grandmother, making the kitchen ring with laughter as they related the last exploits of the raccoon or the squirrel, or described the courtship of the parrot and the crow. And if you had asked any of the three, as they sat together in the porch, who was the happiest person in the world, why, Toto and the Grandmother would each have",

Miss Mary gasped for breath, and fluttered her wings wildly, trying to escape from her tormentor, and presently, finding her voice, she shrieked aloud:-- \"Ke-ke-kee! ki-ko! ki-ko-KAA! Let me go, you little wretch! Let me go this instant, or I'll peck your eyes out! I will--\" \"Oh, no, you won't, my dear!\" said Cracker. \"You wouldn't have the heart to do that; for then how could I look at you, the delight of my life? Tiddy-_tum_! tiddy-_tum_! tiddy-_tum_ tum-tum! just see what a pretty step it is! You will enjoy it immensely, as soon as you know it a little better.\" And he whirled her round faster and faster, trying to keep pace with <DW53> and Toto, who were circling in graceful curves. Suddenly the grandmother uttered an exclamation. \"Toto!\" she cried, \"did you put that custard pie out in the snow to cool? Bruin doesn't like it hot, you know.\" Toto, his head still dizzy from waltzing, looked about him in bewilderment. \"Did I?\" he said. \"I am sure I don't know! I don't remember what I did with it. Oh, yes, I do, though!\" he added hastily. \"It is there, on that chair. Bruin! Bruin, I say! mind what you are about. It is just behind you.\" Thus adjured, the good bear, who had been gravely revolving by himself in the corner until he was quite blind, tried to stop short; at the same instant the squirrel and the parrot, stumbling against his shaggy paw, fell over it in a confused heap of feathers and fur. He stepped hastily back to avoid treading on them, lost his balance, and sat down heavily--on the custard pie! At the crash of the platter, the squirrel released Miss Mary, who flew screaming to her perch; the grandmother wrung her hands and lamented, begging to be told what had happened, and who was hurt; and the unfortunate Bruin, staggering to his feet, stared aghast at the ruin he had wrought. It was a very complete ruin, certainly, for the platter was in small fragments, while most of its contents were clinging to his own shaggy black coat. \"Well, old fellow,\" said Toto, \"you have done it now, haven't you? I tried to stop you, but I was too late.\" \"Yes,\" replied the bear, solemnly, \"I have done it now! And I",

He hasn't been in our part of the wood again, has he?\" \"Oh, no!\" replied Cracker. \"He is not likely to go anywhere for a long time, I should say. He has broken his leg, Chipper tells me, and has been shut up in his cavern for a week and more.\" \"Dear me!\" said the kind-hearted bear. \"I am very sorry to hear it! How does the poor old man get his food?\" \"Chipper didn't seem to think he _could_ get any,\" replied the squirrel. \"He peeped in at the door, yesterday, and saw him lying in his bunk, looking very pale and thin. He tried once or twice to get up, but fell back again; and Chipper is sure there was nothing to eat in the cave. I thought I wouldn't say anything to <DW53> or Toto last night, but would wait till I had told you.\" \"It must be seen to at once!\" cried Bruin, starting up. \"I will go myself, and take care of the poor man till his leg is well. Where are the Madam and Toto? We must tell them at once.\" The blind grandmother was in the kitchen, rolling out pie-crust. She listened, with exclamations of pity and concern, to Cracker's account of the poor old hermit, and agreed with Bruin that aid must be sent to him without delay. \"I will pack a basket at once,\" she said, \"with nourishing food, bandages for the broken leg, and some simple medicines; and Toto, you will take it to the poor man, will you not, dear?\" \"Of course I will!\" said Toto, heartily. But Bruin said: \"No, dear Madam! I will go myself. Our Toto's heart is big, but he is not strong enough to take care of a sick person. It is surely best for me to go.\" The grandmother hesitated. \"Dear Bruin,\" she said, \"of course you _would_ be the best nurse on many accounts; but if the man is weak and nervous, I am afraid--you alarmed him once, you know, and possibly the sight of you, coming in suddenly, might--\" \"Speak out, Granny!\" cried Toto, laughing. \"You think Bruin would simply frighten the man to death, or at best into a fit; and you are quite right. I'll tell you what, old fellow!\" he added, turning to Bruin, who looked sadly crestfallen at this throwing of cold water on the fire of his kindly intentions, \"we will go together, and then the whole thing will be easily managed.

And all the soldiers and all the slaves cried aloud, continually:-- \"Honor to Ly-Chee, the Chief-Sweeper of the court-yard! Honor and peace to him and all his house!\" The procession stopped before the little house, and the good sweeper, stupefied still with astonishment at his wonderful good fortune, dismounted and clasped his wife and children in his arms. And they wept together for joy, and the soldiers and the slaves and all the people wept with them. But the Celestial Emperor, Wah-Song, lay in bed for two weeks, speaking to no man, and eating nothing but water-gruel. And when he arose, at the end of that time, behold! he was as meek as a six-years old child. CHAPTER III. THE grandmother's story was received with great approbation, and the different members of the family commented on it, each after his fashion. \"I should like to have been Chop-Chin!\" exclaimed Toto. \"How exciting it must have been! Only think, <DW53>, of talking to the Emperor in that way, and scolding him as if he were a little boy.\" \"Well, I never saw an Emperor,\" said the raccoon; \"but I certainly should not wish to talk to one, if they are all such wretched creatures as Wah-Song. _I_ should like to have been the Finishing-Toucher; then if he had pulled _my_ nose--hum! ha! we should see!\" \"Dear Madam,\" said the bear, who had been staring meditatively into the fire, \"there is one thing in the story that I do not understand; that is--well--you spoke of the boy's having a pig-tail.\" \"Yes, Bruin!\" said the grandmother. \"A Chinese pig-tail, you know.\" \"Yes, certainly,\" said Bruin. \"A Chinese pig's tail it would naturally be. Now, I confess I do not see _how_ a pig's tail could be worn on the head, or how it could be unbraided; that is, if the Chinese pigs have tails like that of our friend in the sty yonder.\" Toto laughed aloud at this, and even the grandmother could not help smiling a very little; but she gently told Bruin what a Chinaman's pig-tail was, and how he wore it. Meantime, Miss Mary, the parrot, looked on with an air of dignified amusement. \"My respected father,\" she said presently, \"spent some years in China. It is a fine country, though too far from Africa for my taste.\" \"Tell us about your father, Miss Mary!\" exclaimed the squirrel. \"Fine old bird",
