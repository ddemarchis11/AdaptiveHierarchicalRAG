      "text": "Hiram, with sudden suspicion. \"No,\" said the young man frankly. Yet he hesitated a moment as he added, \"I would like to see Miss Flora.\" His hesitation and heightened color were more disarming to suspicion than the most elaborate and carefully prepared indifference. With their knowledge and pride in their relative's fascinations they felt it could have but one meaning! Hiram wiped his mouth with his hand, assumed a demure expression, glanced at his wife, and answered:-- \"She ain't here now.\" Mr. Brice's face displayed his disappointment. But the true lover holds a talisman potent with old and young. Mrs. Tarbox felt a sneaking maternal pity for this suddenly stricken Strephon. \"She's gone home,\" she added more gently--\"went at sun-up this mornin'.\" \"Home,\" repeated Brice. \"Where's that?\" Mrs. Tarbox looked at her husband and hesitated. Then she said--a little in her old manner--\"Her uncle's.\" \"Can you direct me the way there?\" asked Brice simply. The astonishment in their faces presently darkened into suspicion again. \"Ef that's your little game,\" began Hiram, with a lowering brow-- \"I have no little game but to see her and speak with her,\" said Brice boldly. \"I am alone and unarmed, as you see,\" he continued, pointing to his empty belt and small dispatch bag slung on his shoulder, \"and certainly unable to do any one any harm. I am willing to take what risks there are. And as no one knows of my intention, nor of my coming here, whatever might happen to me, no one need know it. You would be safe from questioning.\" There was that hopeful determination in his manner that overrode their resigned doggedness. \"Ef we knew how to direct you thar,\" said the old woman cautiously, \"ye'd be killed outer hand afore ye even set eyes on the girl. The house is in a holler with hills kept by spies; ye'd be a dead man as soon as ye crossed its boundary.\" \"Wot do YOU know about it?\" interrupted her husband quickly, in querulous warning. \"Wot are ye talkin' about?\" \"You leave me alone, Hiram! I ain't goin' to let that young feller get popped off without a show, or without knowin' jest wot he's got to tackle, nohow ye kin fix it! And can't ye see he's bound to go, whatever ye says?\" Mr. Tarbox saw this fact plainly in Brice's eyes, and hesitated. \"The most that I kin tell ye,\" he said gloomily, \"is the way the gal takes when she goes from here, but how far it is, or if it ain't a blind, I can't swar, for I",

For the first time he looked around the room curiously. \"I didn't know you were a land agent before,\" he said. \"No more I was! All that kem out o' that paragraph, Mr. Brice. That man Heckshill, who was so mighty perlite that night, wrote to me afterwards that he didn't know my name till he'd seed that paragraph, and he wanted to know ef, ez a 'well-known citizen,' I could recommend him some timber lands. I recommended him half o' my own quarter section, and he took it. He's puttin' up a mill thar, and that's another reason why we want peace and quietness up thar. I'm tryin' (betwixt and between us, Mr. Brice) to get Harry to cl'ar out and sell his rights in the valley and the water power on the Fork to Heckshill and me. I'm opening a business here.\" \"Then you've left Mrs. Tarbox with Miss Flora in your cabin while you attend to business here,\" said Brice tentatively. \"Not exactly, Mr. Brice. The old woman thought it a good chance to come to 'Frisco and put Flo in one o' them Catholic convent schools--that asks no questions whar the raw logs come from, and turns 'em out first-class plank all round. You foller me, Mr. Brice? But Mrs. Tarbox is jest in the next room, and would admire to tell ye all this--and I'll go in and send her to you.\" And with a patronizing wave of the hand, Mr. Tarbox complacently disappeared in the hall. Mr. Brice was not sorry to be left to himself in his utter bewilderment! Flo, separated from her detrimental uncle, and placed in a convent school! Tarbox, the obscure pioneer, a shrewd speculator emerging into success, and taking the uncle's place! And all this within that month which he had wasted with absurd repinings. How feeble seemed his own adventure and advancement; how even ludicrous his pretensions to any patronage and superiority. How this common backwoodsman had set him in his place as easily as SHE had evaded the advances of the journalist and Heckshill! They had taught him a lesson; perhaps even the sending back of his handkerchief was part of it! His heart grew heavy; he walked to the window and gazed out with a long sigh. A light laugh, that might have been an echo of the one which had attracted him that night in Tarbox's cabin, fell upon his ear. He turned quickly to meet Flora Dimwood's laughing eyes shining upon",

If you doubt my word or the intentions of the company, perhaps you will kindly read that.\" He drew from his pocket a still damp copy of \"The Red Dog Clarion\" and pointed to a paragraph. \"Wot's that?\" she said querulously, feeling for her spectacles. \"Shall I read it?\" \"Go on.\" He read it slowly aloud. I grieve to say it had been jointly concocted the night before at the office of the \"Clarion\" by himself and the young journalist--the latter's assistance being his own personal tribute to the graces of Miss Flo. It read as follows:-- \"The greatest assistance was rendered by Hiram Tarbox, Esq., a resident of the vicinity, in removing the obstruction, which was, no doubt, the preliminary work of some of the robber gang, and in providing hospitality for the delayed passengers. In fact, but for the timely warning of Yuba Bill by Mr. Tarbox, the coach might have crashed into the tree at that dangerous point, and an accident ensued more disastrous to life and limb than the robbery itself.\" The sudden and unmistakable delight that expanded the old woman's mouth was so convincing that it might have given Brice a tinge of remorse over the success of his stratagem, had he not been utterly absorbed in his purpose. \"Hiram!\" she shouted suddenly. The old man appeared from some back door with a promptness that proved his near proximity, and glanced angrily at Brice until he caught sight of his wife's face. Then his anger changed to wonder. \"Read that again, young feller,\" she said exultingly. Brice re-read the paragraph aloud for Mr. Tarbox's benefit. \"That 'ar 'Hiram Tarbox, Esquire,' means YOU, Hiram,\" she gasped, in delighted explanation. Hiram seized the paper, read the paragraph himself, spread out the whole page, examined it carefully, and then a fatuous grin began slowly to extend itself over his whole face, invading his eyes and ears, until the heavy, harsh, dogged lines of his nostrils and jaws had utterly disappeared. \"B'gosh!\" he said, \"that's square! Kin I keep it?\" \"Certainly,\" said Brice. \"I brought it for you.\" \"Is that all ye came for?\" said Hiram, with sudden suspicion. \"No,\" said the young man frankly. Yet he hesitated a moment as he added, \"I would like to see Miss Flora.\" His hesitation and heightened color were more disarming to suspicion than the most elaborate and carefully prepared indifference.

Then there was more talk, and the discovery that Mr. Brice was long due at the office. \"Ye might drop in, now and then, whenever ye feel like it, and Flo is at home,\" suggested Mrs. Tarbox at parting. Mr. Brice DID drop in frequently during the next month. On one of these occasions Mr. Tarbox accompanied him to the door. \"And now--ez everything is settled and in order, Mr. Brice, and ef you should be wantin' to say anything about it to your bosses at the office, ye may mention MY name ez Flo Dimwood's second cousin, and say I'm a depositor in their bank. And,\" with greater deliberation, \"ef anything at any time should be thrown up at ye for marryin' a niece o' Snapshot Harry's, ye might mention, keerless like, that Snapshot Harry, under the name o' Henry J. Dimwood, has held shares in their old bank for years!\" A TREASURE OF THE REDWOODS PART I Mr. Jack Fleming stopped suddenly before a lifeless and decaying redwood-tree with an expression of disgust and impatience. It was the very tree he had passed only an hour before, and he now knew he had been describing that mysterious and hopeless circle familiar enough to those lost in the woods. There was no mistaking the tree, with its one broken branch which depended at an angle like the arm of a semaphore; nor did it relieve his mind to reflect that his mishap was partly due to his own foolish abstraction. He was returning to camp from a neighboring mining town, and while indulging in the usual day-dreams of a youthful prospector, had deviated from his path in attempting to make a short cut through the forest. He had lost the sun, his only guide, in the thickly interlaced boughs above him, which suffused though the long columnar vault only a vague, melancholy twilight. He had evidently penetrated some unknown seclusion, absolutely primeval and untrodden. The thick layers of decaying bark and the desiccated dust of ages deadened his footfall and invested the gloom with a profound silence. As he stood for a moment or two, irresolute, his ear, by this time attuned to the stillness, caught the faint but distinct lap and trickle of water. He was hot and thirsty, and turned instinctively in that direction. A very few paces brought him to a fallen tree; at the foot of its upturned roots gurgled the spring whose upwelling stream had slowly but persistently loosened their hold on the soil, and worked their ruin. A pool of cool and clear water, formed by the disruption of the soil, overflowed, and after a few yards sank again in the",

It was by 'trucklin'' to them 'mean prejudices,' and readin' that thar 'foolish paragraph,' that I settled this thing then and thar!\" Brice's revulsion of sentiment was so complete, and the gratitude that beamed in his eyes was so sincere, that Mr. Tarbox hardly needed the profuse apologies which broke from him. \"Forgive me!\" he continued to stammer, \"I have wronged you, wronged HER--everybody. But as you know, Mr. Tarbox, how I have felt over this, how deeply--how passionately\"-- \"It DOES make a man <DW38> sometimes,\" said Mr. Tarbox, relaxing into demure dryness again, \"so I reckon you DID!
