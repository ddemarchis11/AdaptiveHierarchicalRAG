      "text": "and Brice's bright eyes and heightened color was singularly effective. The \"inside\" passengers, who had experienced neither the excitement nor the danger of the robbery, yet had been obliged to listen to the hairbreadth escapes of the others, pooh-poohed the whole affair, and even the \"outsides\" themselves were at last convinced that the robbery was a slight one, with little or no loss to the company. The clamor subsided almost as suddenly as it had arisen; the wiser passengers fashioned their attitude on the sang-froid of Yuba Bill, and the whole coach load presently rolled away as complacently as if nothing had happened. II The robbery furnished the usual amount of copy for the local press. There was the inevitable compliment to Yuba Bill for his well-known coolness; the conduct of the young expressman, \"who, though new to the service, displayed an intrepidity that only succumbed to numbers,\" was highly commended, and even the passengers received their meed of praise, not forgetting the lady, \"who accepted the incident with the light-hearted pleasantry characteristic of the Californian woman.\" There was the usual allusion to the necessity of a Vigilance Committee to cope with this \"organized lawlessness\" but it is to be feared that the readers of \"The Red Dog Clarion,\" however ready to lynch a horse thief, were of the opinion that rich stage express companies were quite able to take care of their own property. It was with full cognizance of these facts and their uselessness to him that the next morning Mr. Ned Brice turned from the road where the coach had just halted on the previous night and approached the settler's cabin. If a little less sanguine than he was in Yuba Bill's presence, he was still doggedly inflexible in his design, whatever it might have been, for he had not revealed it even to Yuba Bill. It was his own; it was probably crude and youthful in its directness, but for that reason it was probably more convincing than the vacillations of older counsel. He paused a moment at the closed door, conscious, however, of some hurried movement within which signified that his approach had been observed. The door was opened, and disclosed only the old woman. The same dogged expression was on her face as when he had last seen it, with the addition of querulous expectancy. In reply to his polite \"Good-morning,\" she abruptly faced him with her hands still on the door. \"Ye kin stop right there! Ef yer want ter make any talk about this yar robbery, ye might ez well skedaddle to oncet, for we ain't 'takin' any' to-day!\" \"I have no wish to talk about the robbery,\" said Brice quietly, \"and as far as I can prevent it, you will not be troubled by any questions.

I thought they might discover it at once and chase us, but they didn't.\" \"And then thar war no greenbacks in the box that they took?\" gasped Bill, with staring eyes. \"No!\" Bill raised his hand in the air as if in solemn adjuration, and then brought it down on his knee, doubling up in a fit of uncontrollable but perfectly noiseless laughter. \"Oh, Lord!\" he gasped, \"hol' me afore I bust right open! Hush,\" he went on, with a jerk of his fingers towards the next room, \"not a word o' this to any one! It's too much to keep, I know; it's nearly killing me! but we must swaller it ourselves! Oh, Jerusalem the Golden! Oh, Brice! Think o' that face o' Snapshot Harry's ez he opened that treasure box afore his gang in the brush! And he allers so keen and so easy and so cock sure! Created snakes! I'd go through this every trip for one sight of him as he just riz up from that box and cussed!\" He again shook with inward convulsions till his face grew purple, and even the red came back to the younger man's cheek. \"But this don't bring the money back, Bill,\" said Brice gloomily. Yuba Bill swallowed the glass of whiskey at a gulp, wiped his mouth and eyes, smothered a second explosion, and then gravely confronted Brice. \"When do you think it was taken, and how?\" \"It must have been taken when I left the coach on the road and went over to that settler's cabin,\" said Brice bitterly. \"Yet I believed everything was safe, and I left two men--both passengers--one inside and one on the box, that man who sat the other side of you.\" \"Jee whillikins!\" ejaculated Bill, with his hand to his forehead, \"the men I clean forgot to pick up in the road, and now I reckon they never intended to be picked up, either.\" \"No doubt a part of the gang,\" said Brice, with increased bitterness; \"I see it all now.\" \"No!\" said Bill decisively, \"that ain't Snapshot Harry's style; he's a clean fighter, with no underhand tricks. And I don't believe he threw down that tree, either. Look yer, sonny!\" he added, suddenly laying his hand on Brice's shoulder, \"a hundred to one that that was the work of a couple o' d----d sneaks or traitors in that gang who kem along as passengers.

I never took any stock in that coyote who paid extra for his box-seat.\" Brice knew that Bill never looked kindly on any passenger who, by bribing the ticket agent, secured this favorite seat, which Bill felt was due to his personal friends and was in his own selection. He only returned gloomily:-- \"I don't see what difference it makes to us which robber got the money. \"Ye don't,\" said Bill, raising his head, with a sudden twinkle in his eyes. \"Then ye don't know Snapshot Harry. Do ye suppose he's goin' to sit down and twiddle his thumbs with that skin game played on him? No, sir,\" he continued, with a thoughtful deliberation, drawing his fingers slowly through his long beard, \"he spotted it--and smelt out the whole trick ez soon ez he opened that box, and that's why he didn't foller us! He'll hunt those sneak thieves into h-ll but what he'll get 'em, and,\" he went on still more slowly, \"by the livin' hokey! I reckon, sonny, that's jest how ye'll get your chance to chip in!\" \"I don't understand,\" said Brice impatiently. \"Well,\" said Bill, with more provoking slowness, as if he were communing with himself rather than Brice, \"Harry's mighty proud and high toned, and to be given away like this has cut down into his heart, you bet. It ain't the money he's thinkin' of; it's this split in the gang--the loss of his power ez boss, ye see--and ef he could get hold o' them chaps he'd let the money slide ez long ez they didn't get it. So you've got a detective on your side that's worth the whole police force of Californy! Ye never heard anything about Snapshot Harry, did ye?\" asked Bill carelessly, raising his eyes to Brice's eager face. The young man flushed slightly. \"Very little,\" he said. At the same time a vision of the pretty girl in the settler's cabin flashed upon him with a new significance. \"He's more than half white, in some ways,\" said Bill thoughtfully, \"and they say he lives somewhere about here in a cabin in the bush, with a crippled sister and her darter, who both swear by him. It mightn't be hard to find him--ef a man was dead set on it.\" Brice faced about with determined eyes. \"I'LL DO IT,\" he said quietly. \"Ye might,\" said Bill, still more deliberately stroking his beard, \"mention my name, ef ye ever get to see him.\" \"Your name,\" ejaculated the",

The detectives would not be likely to interfere with his plans, for he was the only man who really wished to meet the fugitive. The presence of Poole made him uneasy, though he had never met the man before. Was it barely possible that he was on the same mission on behalf of others? IF what he heard was true, there might be others equally involved with the absconding manager. But then the spies--how could the deputy sheriff elude them, and how could HE? He was turning impatiently away from the window when his eye caught sight of a straggling file of Chinamen breasting the storm on their way up the hill. A sudden idea seized him. Perhaps THEY were the spies in question. He remembered the driver's story. A sudden flash of intuition made him now understand the singular way the file of coolies which they met had diverted their course after passing the wagon. They had recognized the deputy on the box. Stay!--there was another Chinaman in the coach; HE might have given them the signal. He glanced hurriedly around the room for him; he was gone. Perhaps he had already joined the file he had just seen. His only hope was to follow them--but how? and how to do it quietly? The afternoon was waning; it would be three or four hours before the down coach would arrive, from which the driver expected assistance. Now, if ever, was his opportunity. He made his way through the back door, and found himself among the straw and chips of the stable-yard and woodshed. Still uncertain what to do, he mechanically passed before the long shed which served as temporary stalls for the steaming wagon horses. At the further end, to his surprise, was a tethered mustang ready saddled and bridled--the opportune horse left for the fugitive, according to the lounger's story. Masterton cast a quick glance around the stable; it was deserted by all save the feeding animals. He was new to adventures of this kind, or he would probably have weighed the possibilities and consequences. He was ordinarily a thoughtful, reflective man, but like most men of intellect, he was also imaginative and superstitious, and this crowning accident of the providential situation in which he found himself was superior to his logic. There would also be a grim irony in his taking this horse for such a purpose. He again looked and listened. There was no one within sight or hearing. He untied the rope from the bit-ring, leaped into the saddle, and emerged cautiously from the shed. The wet snow muffled the sound of the horse's hoofs. Moving round to the rear of the stable so as to bring it between himself and the station, he clapped his heels into the",

When they had disappeared, the young journalist turned to the lady. \"If you would really like to go to that house, I will gladly accompany you.\" It was possible that in addition to his youthful chivalry there was a little youthful resentment of Yuba Bill's domineering prejudices in his attitude. However, the quiet, observant passenger lifted a look of approval to him, and added, in his previous level, half contemptuous tone:-- \"You'll be quite as well there as here, madam, and there is certainly no reason for your stopping in the coach when the driver chooses to leave it.\" The passengers looked at each other. The stranger spoke with authority, and Bill had certainly been a little arbitrary! \"I'll go too,\" said the passenger by the window. \"And you'll come, won't you, Ned?\" he added to the express messenger. The young man hesitated; he was recently appointed, and as yet fresh to the business--but he was not to be taught his duty by an officious stranger! He resented the interference youthfully by doing the very thing he would have preferred NOT to do, and with assumed carelessness--yet feeling in his pocket to assure himself that the key of the treasure compartment was safe--turned to follow them. \"Won't YOU come too?\" said the journalist, politely addressing the cynical passenger. \"No, I thank you! I'll take charge of the coach,\" was the smiling rejoinder, as he settled himself more comfortably in his seat. The little procession moved away in silence. Oddly enough, no one, except the lady, really cared to go, and two--the expressman and journalist--would have preferred to remain on the coach. But the national instinct of questioning any purely arbitrary authority probably was a sufficient impulse. As they neared the opened door of what appeared to be a four-roomed, unpainted, redwood boarded cabin, the passenger who had occupied the seat near the window said,-- \"I'll go first and sample the shanty.\" He was not, however, so far in advance of them but that the others could hear quite distinctly his offhand introduction of their party on the threshold, and the somewhat lukewarm response of the inmates. \"We thought we'd just drop in and be sociable until the coach was ready to start again,\" he continued, as the other passengers entered. \"This yer gentleman is Ned Brice, Adams & Co.'s expressman; this yer is Frank Frenshaw, editor of the 'Mountain Banner;' this yer's a lady, so it ain't necessary",
