It's rale plazed I am, sure enough. Manny's the time Docthor O'Shaughnessy's tell't me there was no sich thing as yez; but I niver belaved him, yer Honor!\" \"That's right!\" said the Green Man, heartily, \"that's very right. Never believe a word he says! And now, Eily, alanna, I'm going to do ye a fairy's turn before I go. Ye shall have yer wish of whatever ye like in the world. Take a minute to think about it, and then make up yer mind.\" Eily fairly gasped for breath. Her dreams had then come true; she was to have a fairy wish! Could it possibly be true? And what should she wish for? The magic carpet? The goose that laid eggs of gold? The invisible cloak? Eily had all the old fairy-stories at her tongue's end, for her mother told her one every night as she sat at her spinning. Jack and the Beanstalk, the Sleeping Beauty, the Seven Swans, the Elves that stole Barney Maguire, the Brown Witch, and the Widdy Malone's Pig,--she knew them all, and scores of others besides. Her mother always began the stories with, \"Wanst upon a time, and a very good time it was;\" or, \"Long, long ago, whin King O'Toole was young, and the praties grew all ready biled in the ground;\" or, \"Wan fine time, whin the fairies danced, and not a poor man lived in Ireland.\" In this way, the fairies seemed always to be thrown far back into a remote past, which had nothing in common with the real work-a-day world in which Eily lived. But now--oh, wonder of wonders!--now, here was a real fairy, alive and active, with as full power of blessing or banning as if the days of King O'Toole had come again,--and what was more, with good-will to grant to Eileen Macarthy whatever in the wide world she might wish for!

The child stood quite still, with her hands clasped, thinking harder than she had ever thought in all her life before; and the Green Man sat on the toadstool and watched her, with eyes which twinkled with some amusement, but no malice. \"Take yer time, my dear,\" he said, \"take yer time! Ye'll not meet a Green Man every day, so make the best o' your chance!\" Suddenly Eily's face lighted up with a sudden inspiration. \"Och!\" she cried, \"sure I have it, yer Riverence's Grace--Honor, I shud say! I have it! it's the di'monds and pearrls I'll have, iv ye plaze!\" \"Diamonds and pearls?\" repeated the fairy, \"what diamonds and pearls? There are a great many in the world. You don't want them _all_, surely?\" \"Och, no, yer Honor!\" said Eily. \"Only wan of aich to dhrop out o' me mouth ivery time I shpake, loike the girrl in the sthory, ye know. Whiniver she opened her lips to shpake, a di'mond an' a pearrl o' the richest beauty dhropped from her mouth. That's what I mane, plaze yer Honor's Grace. Och! wudn't it be beautiful, entirely?\" \"Humph!\" said the fairy, looking rather grave. \"Are ye _quite_ sure that this is what you wish for most, Eileen? Don't decide hastily, or ye may be sorry for it.\" \"Sorry!\" cried Eileen, \"what for wud I be sorry? Sure I'd be richer than the Countess o' Kilmoggen hersilf, let alone the Queen, be the time I'd talked for an hour. An' I _loove_ to talk!\" she added softly, half to herself. The Green Man laughed outright at this. \"Well, Eily,\" he said, \"ye shall have yer own way. Stoop down to me here!\" Eileen bent down, and he touched her lips three times with the scarlet tassel of his cap. \"Slanegher Banegher!\" he said. \"The charm is worked. Now go home, Eileen Macarthy, and the good wishes of the Green Men go with ye. Ye will have yer own wish fulfilled as soon as ye cross the threshold of yer home.

A big green grasshopper, caught be his leg in a spider's wib. Wait a bit, poor crathur, oi'll lit ye free agin.\" Full of pity for the poor grasshopper, Eily stooped to lift it carefully out of the treacherous net into which it had fallen. But what was her amazement on perceiving that the creature was not a grasshopper, but a tiny man, clad from head to foot in light green, and with a scarlet cap on his head. The little fellow was hopelessly entangled in the net, from which he made desperate efforts to free himself, but the silken strands were quite strong enough to hold him prisoner. For a moment Eileen stood petrified with amazement, murmuring to herself, \"Howly Saint Bridget! what will I do now at all? Sure, I niver thought I'd find wan really in loife!\" but the next moment her kindness of heart triumphed over her fear, and stooping once more she very gently took the little man up between her thumb and finger, pulled away the clinging web, and set him respectfully on the top of a large toadstool which stood conveniently near. The little Green Man shook himself, dusted his jacket with his red cap, and then looked up at Eileen with twinkling eyes. \"Thank ye, my maiden!\" he said kindly. \"Ye have saved my life, and ye shall not be the worse for it, if ye _did_ take me for a grasshopper.\" Eily was rather abashed at this, but the little man looked very kind; so she plucked up her courage, and when he asked, \"What is yer name, my dear?\" (\"jist for all the wurrld the way I thought of,\" she said to herself) answered bravely, with a low courtesy, \"Eileen Macarthy, yer Honor's",

If that ever happens, come to this same place with a sprig of holly in yer hand. Strike this toadstool three times, and say, 'Slanegher Banegher, Skeen na Lane!' And now good-by to ye!\" and clapping his scarlet cap on his head, the little man leaped from the toadstool, and instantly disappeared from sight among the ferns and mosses. Eileen stood still for some time, lost in a dream of wonder and delight. Finally rousing herself, she gave a long, happy sigh, and hastily filling her apron with sticks, turned her steps homeward. The sun was sinking low when she came in sight of the little cabin, at the door of which her mother was standing, looking anxiously in every direction. \"Is it yersilf, Eily?\" cried the good woman in a tone of relief, as she saw the child approaching. \"And where have ye been at all? It's a wild colleen y'are, to be sprankin' about o' this way, and it nearly sundown. Where have ye been, I'm askin' ye?\" Eily held up her apronful of sticks with a beaming smile, but answered never a word till she stood on the threshold of the cottage. (\"Sure I might lose some,\" she had been saying to herself, \"and that 'ud niver do.\") But as soon as she had entered the little room which was kitchen, hall, dining-room, and drawing-room for the Macarthy family, she dropped her bundle of <DW19>s, and clasping her hands together, cried, \"Och, mother! what do ye think? Sure ye'll niver belave me whin I till ye--\" Here she suddenly stopped, for hop! pop! two round shining things dropped from her mouth, and rolled away over the floor of the cabin. \"Howly Michael be me guide!\" cried Mrs. Macarthy; \"phwhat's that?\" \"It's marvels! [marbles]\" shouted little Phelim, jumping up from his seat by the fire and running to pick up the shining objects. \"Eily's got her mouf full o' marvels! Hurroo!\" \"They aren't marvels!\" said Eily, indignantly. \"Wait till I till ye, mother asthore!

Och, wirra! wirra! what'll I do at all? Run, Phelim,\" she added, \"an' call yer father. He's in the praty-patch, loikely.

This was a sad beginning of all her glory. She tried desperately to open her mouth, sure that in a moment she could make her mother understand the whole matter. But Honor Macarthy was a stalwart woman, and Eily's slender fingers could not stir the massive hand which was pressed firmly upon her lips. At this moment her father entered hastily, with Phelim panting behind him. \"Phwhat's the matther, woman?\" he asked anxiously. \"Here's Phelim clane out o' his head, an' shcramin' about Eily, an' marvels an' buttons, an' I dunno what all.
