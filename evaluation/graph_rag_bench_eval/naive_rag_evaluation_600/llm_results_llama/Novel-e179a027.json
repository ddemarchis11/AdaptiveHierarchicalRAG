Kempner--a pale, dogged man, with a pompous white moustache which pouted and bristled while he spoke--rose and delivered a pointless oration. \"Ignoring race and creed,\" he droned, \"we must stand together--\" Heywood balanced a pencil, twirled it, and at last took to drawing. On the polished wood he scratched, with great pains, the effigy of a pig, whose snout blared forth a gale of quarter-notes. \"Whistle away!\" he muttered; then resumed, as if no one had interrupted: \"Very good of you, Gilly. But with your permission, I see five points.--Here's a rough sketch, made some time ago.\" He tossed on the table a sheet of paper. Forrester spread it, frowning, while the others leaned across or craned over his chair. \"All out of whack, you see,\" explained the draughtsman; \"but here are my points, Gilly. One: your house lies quite inland, with four sides to defend: the river and marsh give Rudie's but two and a fraction. Boats? Not hardly: we'd soon stop that, as you'll see, if they dare. Anyhow,--point two,--your house is all hillocks behind, and shops roundabout: here's just one low ridge, and the rest clear field. Third: the Portuguese built a well of sorts in the courtyard; water's deadly, I dare say, but your place has no well whatever. And as to four, suppose--in a sudden alarm, say, those cut off by land could run another half-chance to reach the place by river.--By the way, the nunnery has a bell to ring.\" Gilbert Forrester shoved the map along to his neighbor, and cleared his throat. \"Gentlemen,\" he declared slowly, \"you once did me the honor to say that in--in a certain event, you would consider me as acting head. Frankly, I confess, my plans were quite--ah!--vague. I wish to--briefly, to resign, in favor of this young--ah--bachelor.\" \"Don't go rotting me,\" complained Heywood, and his sallow cheeks turned ruddy. \"I merely bring up these points. And five is this: your compound's very cramped, where the nunnery could shelter the goodly blooming fellowship of native converts.\" Chantel laughed heartily, and stretched his legs at ease under the table. [Illustration: Portuguese Nunnery:--Sketch Map.] \"What strategy!\" he chuckled, preening his moustache. \"Your mythical siege--it will be brief! For me, I vote",

BRETT 1909 To CHARLES TOWNSEND COPELAND,   15 Hollis Hall, Cambridge, Massachusetts Dear Cope, Mr. Peachey Carnehan, when he returned from Kafiristan, in bad shape but with a king's head in a bag, exclaimed to the man in the newspaper office, \"And you've been sitting there ever since!\" There is only a pig in the following poke; and yet in giving you the string to cut and the bag to open, I feel something of Peachey's wonder to think of you, across all this distance and change, as still sitting in your great chair by the green lamp, while past a dim background of books moves the procession of youth.

The other night I thought you were somewhere out on board a junk, and Flounce with you. I swam like anything, miles and miles, but couldn't get out to you. Worked like steam, and no headway. Flounce knew I was coming, but you didn't. Deuced odd, how real it seemed.\" She laughed, as though they had walked past some danger. \"And speaking of dragons,\" she rejoined. \"They _do_ help. The man in the story, that dipped in dragon's blood, was made invulnerable.\" \"Oh?\" He stood plainly at a loss. \"Oh, I see. German, wasn't he?--Pity they didn't pop Rudie Hackh in!\" Her swift upward glance might have been admiration, if she had not said:-- \"Your mind works very slowly.\" \"Oh?\" Again he paused, as though somewhat hurt; then answered cheerfully: \"Dare say. Always did. Thought at first you meant the rattan-juice kind, from Sumatra.\" The gate of the town yawned black. From the streets glimmered a few lanterns, like candles in a long cave. But shunning these unfriendly corridors, he led her roundabout, now along the walls, now through the dim ways of an outlying hamlet. A prolonged shriek of growing fright and anguish came slowly toward them--the cry of a wheelbarrow carrying the great carcass of a pig, waxy white and waxy red, like an image from a chamber of horrors. In the blue twilight, fast deepening, the most familiar things became grotesque. A woman's voice telling stories behind shadow pictures, and the capricious play of the black puppets on her lighted screen, had the effect of incantation. Before the booth of a dentist, the long strings of black teeth swayed in the lantern-glow, rattling, like horrid necklaces of cannibals. And from a squat den--where on a translucent placard in the dull window flickered the words \"Foreign Earth,\" and the guttering door-lantern hinted \"As You Like It\"--there came a sweet, insidious, potent smell that seemed more poisonous than mere opium. \"Let's go faster,\" said the girl. \"Somehow, the dark makes me uneasy to-night.\" Skirting the town, they struck at last the open road beyond, and saw against a fading sky the low black bulk of the nunnery, pierced with orange squares. Past its landward wall, lanterns moved slowly, clustered here and there by twos and threes, and dispersed. Cackling argument came from the ditch, wherever the lantern-bearers",

      "text": "the rebels withdrew to a safe distance from the landing. The casualties of the day were three killed and six wounded, two of the latter dying shortly afterward. The fight at what was known as the \"hornet's nest\" was most terrific, and had not the First battery held out so heroically and valiantly the rebels would have succeeded in forcing a retreat of the Union lines to a point dangerously near the Tennessee river. Capt. Munch's horse received a bullet In his head and fell, and the captain himself received a wound in the thigh, disabling him from further service during the battle. After Capt. Munch was wounded Lieut. Pfaender took command of the battery, and he had a horse shot from under him during the day. On the morning of April 7, Gen. Buell having arrived, the battery was held in reserve and did not participate in the battle that day. The First battery was the only organization from Minnesota engaged in the battle, and their conduct in the fiercest of the struggle, and in changing position in face of fire from the whole rebel line, was such as to receive the warmest commendation from the commanding officer. It was the first battle in which they had taken part, and as they had only received their guns and horses a few weeks before, they had not had much opportunity for drill work. Their terrible execution at critical times convinced the rebels that they had met a foe worthy of their steel. Among the many thousands left dead and dying on the blood-stained field of Pittsburg Landing there was one name that was very dear in the hearts of the patriotic people of St. Paul,--a name that was as dear to the people of St. Paul as was the memory of the immortal Ellsworth to the people of Chicago. Capt. William Henry Acker, while marching at the head of his company, with uplifted sword and with voice and action urging on his comrades to the thickest of the fray, was pierced in the forehead by a rebel bullet and fell dead upon the ill-fated field. Before going into action Capt. Acker was advised by his comrades not to wear his full uniform, as he was sure to be a target for rebel bullets, but the captain is said to have replied that if he had to die he would die with his harness on. Soon after forming his command into line, and when they had advanced only a few yards, he was singled out by a rebel sharpshooter and instantly killed--the only man in the. company to receive fatal injuries. \"Loved, almost adored, by the company,\" says one of them, writing of the sad event, \"Capt. Acker's fall cast a deep shadow of gloom over his command.\" It was but for a moment. With a last look at their dead commander, and with the watchword 'this for our captain,' volley after volley from their guns carried death into the ranks of his murderers. From",
