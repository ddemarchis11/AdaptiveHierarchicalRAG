Were Cadgwith a little nearer civilisation, what a show-place it would become! But happily civilisation leaves it alone. The tiny farm-house on the hill-side near the Frying-pan looked, within and without, much as it must have looked for the last hundred years; and the ragged, unkempt, tongue-tied little girl, from whom we succeeded in getting a drink of milk in a tumbler which she took five minutes to search for, had certainly never been to a Board School. She investigated the penny which we deposited as if it were a great natural curiosity rarely attainable, and she gazed after us as we climbed the stile leading to the Frying-pan as if wondering what on earth could tempt respectable people, who had nothing to do, into such a very uncomfortable place. [Illustration: THE DEVIL'S FRYING PAN, NEAR CADGWITH.] Uncomfortable, certainly, as we sat with our feet stuck in the long grass to prevent slipping down the <DW72>--a misadventure which would have been, to say the least, awkward. Those boiling waves, roaring each after each through the arch below; and those jagged rocks, round which innumerable sea-birds were flying--one could quite imagine that were any luckless vessel to find itself in or near the Frying-pan, it would never get out again. To meditative minds there is something very startling in the perpetual contrast between the summer tourist-life, so cheerful and careless, and the winter life of the people here, which must be so full of privations; for one half the year there is nothing to do, no market for serpentine, and almost no fishing possible: they have to live throughout the dark days upon the hay made while the sun shines. \"No, no,\" said one of the Lizard folk, whom I asked if there was much drunkenness thereabout, for I had seen absolutely none; \"no, us don't drink; us can't afford it. Winter's a bad time for we--sometimes for four months a man doesn't earn a halfpenny. He has to save in summer, or he'd starve the rest of the year.\" Which apparently is not altogether bad for him. I have seldom seen, in any part of England or Scotland, such an honest, independent, respectable race as the working people on this coast, and indeed throughout Cornwall. We left with regret the pretty village, resolving to come back again in a day or two; it was barely three miles from the Lizard, though the difference in climate was said to be so great. And then we drove back across the bleak down and",

The climate, Charles told me, is so mild, that invalids often settle down in the one inn--a mere village inn externally, but very comfortable. And, as I afterwards heard at Lizard Town, the parson and his wife--\"didn't I know them?\" and I felt myself rather looked down upon because I did not know them--are the kindest of people, who take pleasure in looking after the invalids, rich or poor. \"Yes,\" Charles considered Cadgwith was a nice place to winter in, \"only just a trifle dull.\" Probably so, to judge by the interest which, even in this tourist-season, our carriage excited, as we wound down one side and up another of the ravine in which the village is built, with a small fishing-station at the bottom, rather painfully odoriferous. The fisher-wives came to their doors, the old fisher-men stood, hands in pockets, the roly-poly healthy fisher-children stopped playing, to turn round and stare. In these parts everybody stares at everybody, and generally everybody speaks to everybody--a civil \"good-day\" at any rate, sometimes more. \"This is a heavy pull for you,\" said a sympathetic old woman, who had watched me leave the carriage and begin mounting the cliff towards the Devil's Frying-pan--the principal thing to be seen at Cadgwith. She followed me, and triumphantly passed me, though she had to carry a bag of potatoes on her back. I wondered if her feeling was pity or envy towards another old person who had to carry nothing but her own self. Which, alas! was enough! She and I sat down together on the hill-side and had a chat, while I waited for the two little black dots which I could see moving round the opposite headland. She gave me all kinds of information, in the simple way peculiar to country folk, whose innocent horizon comprises the whole world, which, may be, is less pleasant than the little world of Cadgwith. Then we parted for ever and aye. The Devil's Frying-pan is a wonderful sight. Imagine a natural amphitheatre two acres in extent, inclosed by a semi-circular <DW72> about two hundred feet high, covered with grass and flowers and low bushes. Outside, the wide, open sea, which pours in to the shingly beach at the bottom through an arch of serpentine, the colouring of which, and of the other rocks surrounding it, is most exquisite, varying from red to green, with sometimes a tint of grey.

Not in a frantic rushing about from place to place, glancing at everything and observing nothing; flying from town to town, from hotel to hotel, eager to \"do\" and to see a country, in order that when they get home they may say they have done it, and seen it. Only to say;--as for any real vision of eye, heart, and brain, they might as well go through the world blindfold. It is not the things we see, but the mind we see them with, which makes the real interest of travelling. \"Eyes and No Eyes,\"--an old-fashioned story about two little children taking a walk; one seeing everything, and enjoying everything, and the other seeing nothing, and thinking the expedition the dullest imaginable. This simple tale, which the present generation has probably never read, contains the essence of all rational travelling. So when, as the \"old hen,\" (which I am sometimes called, from my habit of going about with a brood of \"chickens,\" my own or other people's) I planned a brief tour with two of them, one just entered upon her teens, the other in her twenties, I premised that it must be a tour after my own heart. \"In the first place, my children, you must obey orders implicitly. I shall collect opinions, and do my best to please everybody; but in travelling one only must decide, the others coincide. It will save them a world of trouble, and their 'conductor' also; who, if competent to be trusted at all, should be trusted absolutely. Secondly, take as little luggage as possible. No sensible people travel with their point-lace and diamonds. Two 'changes of raiment,' good, useful dresses, prudent boots, shawls, and waterproofs--these I shall insist upon, and nothing more. Nothing for show, as I shall take you to no place where you can show off. We will avoid all huge hotels, all fashionable towns; we will study life in its simplicity, and make ourselves happy",

These varied records of the hero's last resting-place remind one of the three heads, said to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little boy, one as a young man, and the third as an old man. But after all my last and vividest recollection of King Arthur's country is that wild sail--so wild that I wished I had taken it alone--in the solitary boat, up and down the tossing waves in face of Tintagel rock; the dark, iron-bound coast with its awful caves, the bright sunshiny land, and ever-threatening sea. Just the region, in short, which was likely to create a race like that which Arthurian legend describes, full of passionate love and deadly hate, capable of barbaric virtues, and equally barbaric crimes. An age in which the mere idea of such a hero as that ideal knight \"Who reverenced his conscience as his God: Whose glory was redressing human wrong: Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it: Who loved one only, and who clave to her--\" rises over the blackness of darkness like a morning star. If Arthur could \"come again\"--perhaps in the person of one of the descendants of a prince who was not unlike him, who lived and died among us in this very nineteenth century-- \"Wearing the white flower of a blameless life--\" if this could be--what a blessing for Arthur's beloved England! [Illustration: THE OLD POST-OFFICE, TREVENA.] L'ENVOI Written more than a year after. The \"old hen\" and her chickens have long been safe at home. A dense December fog creeps in everywhere, choking and blinding, as I finish the history of those fifteen innocent days, calm as autumn, and bright as spring, when we three took our Unsentimental Journey together through Cornwall. Many a clever critic, like Sir Charles Coldstream when he looked into the crater of Vesuvius, may see \"nothing in it\"--a few kindly readers looking a little further, may see a little more: probably the writer only sees the whole. But such as it is, let it stay--simple memorial of what Americans would call \"a good time,\" the sunshine of which may cast its brightness far forward, even into that quiet time \"when travelling days are done.\" THE END.
