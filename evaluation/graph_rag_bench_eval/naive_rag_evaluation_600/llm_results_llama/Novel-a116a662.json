      "text": "new, subtle bond between two lonely men. Before them opened a broad field dotted with curious white disks, like bone buttons thrown on a green carpet. Near at hand, coolies trotted and stooped, laying out more of these circular baskets, filled with tiny dough-balls. Makers of rice-wine, said Heywood; as he strode along explaining, he threw off his surly fit. The brilliant sunlight, the breeze stirring toward them from a background of drooping bamboos, the gabble of coolies, the faint aroma of the fermenting _no-me_ cakes, began, after all, to give a truant sense of holiday. Almost gayly, the companions threaded a marshy path to the river, and bargained with a shrewd, plump woman who squatted in the bow of a sampan. She chaffered angrily, then laughed at some unknown saying of Heywood's, and let them come aboard. Summoned by voluble scolding, her husband appeared, and placidly labored at the creaking sweep. They slipped down a river of bronze, between the oozy banks; and the war-junks, the naked fisherman, the green-coated ruins of forts, drifted past like things in reverie, while the men lay smoking, basking in bright weather. They looked up into serene spaces, and forgot the umbra of pestilence. Heywood, now lazy, now animated, exchanged barbaric words with the boat-woman. As their tones rose and fell, she laughed. Long afterward, Rudolph was to remember her, a wholesome, capable figure in faded blue, darting keen glances from her beady eyes, flashing her white teeth in a smile, or laughing till the green pendants of false jade trembled in her ears. \"Her name is Mrs. Wu,\" said Heywood, between smoke-rings, \"and she is a lady of humor. We are discussing the latest lawsuit, which she describes as suing a flea and winning the bite. Her maiden name was the Pretty Lily. She is captain of this sampan, and fears that her husband does not rate A. B.\" Where the river disembogued, the Pretty Lily, cursing and shrilling, pattering barefoot about her craft, set a matting sail and caught the breeze. Over the copper surface of the roadstead, the sampan drew out handily. Ahead, a black, disreputable little steamer lay anchored, her name--two enormous hieroglyphics painted amidships--staring a bilious yellow in the morning sun. Under these, at last, the sampan came bumping, unperceived or neglected. Overhead, a pair of white shoes protruded from the rail in a blue film of smoke. They twitched, as a dry cackle of laughter broke out. \"Kut Sing, ahoy!\"",

He seemed a conjurer, creating banquets for sheer mischief in the wilderness. \"There's a soup!\" he had proclaimed. \"Patent, mind ye! Stick a knife into the tin, and she 'eats 'erself!\" Among all the revelers, one face alone showed melancholy. Chantel, at the foot of the table, sat unregarded by all save Rudolph, who now and then caught from him a look filled with gloom and suspicion. It was beside Rudolph that Mrs. Forrester laughed and chattered, calling all eyes toward her, and yet finding private intervals in which to dart a sidelong shaft at her neighbor. Rudolph's ears shone coral pink; for now again he was aboard ship, hiding a secret at once dizzy, dangerous, and entrancing. Across the talk, the wine, the many lights, came the triumph of seeing that other hostile face, glowering in defeat. Never before had Chantel, and all the others, dwindled so far into such nonentity, or her presence vibrated so near. Soon he became aware that Captain Kneebone had risen, with a face glowing red above the candles. Even Sturgeon forgot the flood of bounties, and looked expectantly toward their source. The captain cleared his throat, faltered, then turning sheepish all at once, hung his head. \"Be 'anged, I can't make a speech, after all,\" he grumbled; and wheeling suddenly on Heywood, with a peevish air of having been defrauded: \"Aboard ship I could sit and think up no end o' flowery talk, and now it's all gone!\" He stared at his plate miserably. It was Miss Drake who came to his rescue. \"Tell us the secret,\" she begged. \"How do you manage all these nice things?\" The captain's eyes surveyed the motley collection down the length of the bright table, then returned to her, gratefully:-- \"This ain't anything. Only a little--bloomin'--\" \"Impromptu,\" suggested Heywood. \"That's the word!\" Captain Kneebone eyed them both with uncommon favor. \"That's it, ye know. I just 'opped about Saigong like a--jackdaw, picking up these impromptus. But I came here all the way to break the news proper, by word o' mouth.\" He faced the company, and gathering himself for the effort,-- \"I'm rich,\" he declared. \"I'm da--I'm remarkable rich.\" Pausing for the effect, he warmed to his oratory. \"It ain't for me to boast. Sailormen as a rule are bad hands to save money. But I've won first",

All his life seemed to have rushed concentrating into that one instant of extreme trouble, happiness, trembling fascination. Footsteps sounded on the deck behind them; an unwelcome voice called jocosely:-- \"Good efening!\" The ship's doctor advanced with a roguish, paternal air. \"You see at the phosphor, not?\" Even as she whipped about toward the light, Rudolph had seen, with a touch of wonder, how her face changed from a bitter frown to the most friendly smile. The frown returned, became almost savage, when the fat physician continued:-- \"To see the phosphor is too much moon, Mrs. Forrester?\" Had the steamer crashed upon a reef, he would hardly have noticed such a minor shipwreck. Mrs. Forrester? why, then--When the doctor, after ponderous pleasantries, had waddled away aft, Rudolph turned upon her a face of tragedy. \"Was that true?\" he demanded grimly. \"Was what true?\" she asked, with baby eyes of wonder, which no longer deceived, but angered. \"What the doctor said.\" Rudolph's voice trembled. \"The tittle--the title he gave you.\" \"Why, of course,\" she laughed. \"And you did not tell me!\" he began, with scorn. \"Don't be foolish,\" she cut in. From beneath her skirt the toe of a small white shoe tapped the deck angrily. Of a sudden she laughed, and raised a tantalizing face, merry, candid, and inscrutable. \"Why, you never asked me, and--and of course I thought you were saying it all along. You have such a dear, funny way of pronouncing, you know.\" He hesitated, almost believing; then, with a desperate gesture, wheeled and marched resolutely aft. That night it was no Prussian snores which kept him awake and wretched. \"Everything is finished,\" he thought abysmally. He lay overthrown, aching, crushed, as though pinned under the fallen walls of his youth. At breakfast-time, the ship lay still beside a quay where mad crowds of brown and yellow men, scarfed, swathed, and turbaned in riotous colors, worked quarreling with harsh cries, in unspeakable interweaving uproar. The air, hot and steamy, smelled of strange earth. As Rudolph followed a Malay porter toward the gang-plank, he was painfully aware that Mrs. Forrester had turned from the rail and stood waiting in his path. \"Without saying good-by?\" she reproached him. The injured wonder in her eyes he thought a little overdone. \"Good-by.\" He could not halt,",

It was a disappointing trifle: Mrs. Forrester waited below for her husband, to walk home. \"Can't leave now,\" snapped Gilly. \"I'll be along, tell her--\" \"Had she better go alone?\" suggested Heywood. \"No; right you are.\" The other swept a fretful eye about the company. \"But this business begins to look urgent.--Here, somebody we can spare. You go, Hackh, there's a good chap.\" Chantel dropped the helmet he had caught up. Bowing stiffly, Rudolph marched across the room and down the stairs. His face, pale at the late spectacle, had grown red and sulky, \"Can spare me, can you?--I'm the one.\" He descended, muttering. Viewing himself thus, morosely, as rejected of men, he reached the compound gate to fare no better with the woman. She stood waiting in the shadow of the wall; and as he drew unwillingly near, the sight of her--to his shame and quick dismay--made his heart leap in welcome. She wore the coolest and severest white, but at her throat the same small furbelow, every line of which he had known aboard ship, in the days of his first exile and of his recent youth. It was now as though that youth came flooding back to greet her. \"Good-morning.\" He forgot everything, except that for a few priceless moments they would be walking side by side. She faced him with a start, never so young and beautiful as now--her blue eyes wide, scornful, and blazing, her cheeks red and lips trembling, like a child ready to cry. \"I did not want _you_\" she said curtly. \"Nor did they.\" Pride forged the retort for him, at a blow. He explained in the barest of terms, while she eyed him steadily, with every sign of rising temper. \"I can spare you, too,\" she whipped out; then turned to walk away, holding her helmet erect, in the poise of a young goddess, pert but warlike. This double injustice left Rudolph chafing. In two strides, however, he had overtaken her. \"I am under orders,\" he stated grimly. Her pace gradually slackened in the growing heat; but she went forward with her eyes fixed on the littered, sunken flags of their path. This rankling silence seemed to him more unaccountable and deadly than all former mischances, and left him far more alone. From the sultry tops of bamboos, drooping like plants in an oven, an amorous multitude of cicadas maintained the buzzing torment of steel on emery wheels, as though the universal heat had chafed and fretted itself into a dry,",

Everywhere, like other bells more tiny and shrill, sounded the trilling of frogs. As the two on the pagoda stood listening,-- \"It was before Rome,\" she declared thoughtfully. \"Before Egypt, and has never changed. You and I are just--\" She broke off, humming:-- \"Only here and now? Behold They were the same in years of old!\" Her mood  the scene: the aged continuity of life oppressed him. Yet he chose rather to watch the straggling battlements, far off, than to meet her eyes or see her hair gleaming in the sun. Through many troubled days he had forgotten her, despised her, bound his heart in triple brass against a future in her hateful neighborhood; and now, beside her at this time-worn rail, he was in danger of being happy. It was inglorious. He tried to frown. \"You poor boy.\" Suddenly, with an impulse that must have been generous, she rested her hand on his arm. \"I was sorry. I thought of you so often.\" At these close quarters, her tremulous voice and searching upward glance meant that she alone understood all his troubles. He started, turned for some rush of overwhelming speech, when a head popped through the window behind them. \"Boot and saddle, Mrs. Forrester,\" announced Heywood. His lean young face was very droll and knowing. \"We're leaving, bottom-side.\" \"Thank you so much, Maurice,\" she answered, perhaps dryly. \"You're a dear, to climb all those dreadful stairs.\" \"Oh!\" said Heywood, with his gray eyes fastened on Rudolph, \"no trouble.\" All three went down the dark well together. When the company were mounted, and trooping downhill through the camphor shadow, Heywood's pony came sidling against Rudolph's, till legging chafed legging. \"You blossomed, old boy,\" he whispered. \"Quite the star, after your comedy turn.\" He reined aside, grinning. \"What price sympathy on a pagoda?\" For that moment, Rudolph could have struck down the one sure friend he had in China. CHAPTER VII IPHIGENIA \"Don't chop off a hen's head with a battle-axe.\" Heywood, still with a malicious, friendly quirk at the corners of his mouth, held in his fretful pony. Rudolph stood bending a whip viciously. They two had fetched a compass about the town, and now in the twilight were parting before the nunnery gate. \"A tiff's the last thing I'd want with you. The lady, in confidence, is not worth--\" \"I do not wish,\" declared Rudolph, trembling,--\"I do not",
