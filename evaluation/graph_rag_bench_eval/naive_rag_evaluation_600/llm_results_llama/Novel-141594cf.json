  "question": "How does the narrative depict the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery, specifically through Blore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver and the process by which Major Tarver is ultimately accepted by Salome?",
  "gold_answer": "Major Tarver is shown being introduced by Blore and ultimately accepted by Salome, illustrating the process by which new individuals are incorporated into the group.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative depicts the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery through Blore's action and Major Tarver's acceptance by Salome as a complex and somewhat awkward process.\n\nInitially, Blore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey is portrayed as a somewhat hasty and thoughtless decision, as evidenced by the girls' guilty reactions and Blore's vindictive comment to himself (\"'Ussies!\"). This suggests that the established group at the Deanery is not always welcoming or inclusive of new members.\n\nHowever, as the narrative progresses, it becomes clear that Major Tarver's acceptance by Salome is a deliberate and carefully planned process. Major Tarver's initial proposal to Salome is portrayed as a somewhat awkward and desperate attempt to win her affection, but Salome's response is one of kindness and compassion. She is willing to listen to Major Tarver's proposal and even offers to help him with his costume for the evening's festivities.\n\nThe narrative also highlights the role of Mr. Darbey in facilitating Major Tarver's acceptance by Salome. Mr. Darbey's patronizing and somewhat condescending attitude towards Sheba is contrasted with his more genuine and affectionate behavior towards Salome. Through Mr. Darbey's character, the narrative suggests that the established group at the Deanery is not a monolithic entity, but rather a complex web of relationships and alliances.\n\nThe ultimate acceptance of Major Tarver by Salome is portrayed as a gradual and tentative process. Salome's initial hesitation and reluctance to accept Major Tarver's proposal are gradually overcome as she comes to see him as a vulnerable and pitiful figure. The narrative suggests that Salome's acceptance of Major Tarver is motivated by a desire to help him and alleviate his suffering, rather than any romantic or emotional attachment.\n\nOverall, the narrative depicts the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery as a complex and nuanced process, marked by moments of awkwardness, hesitation, and ultimately, acceptance.",

THE END OF THE FIRST SCENE. _The second scene is the Morning Room at the Deanery again._ _SALOME and SHEBA are sitting there gloomily._ SALOME. Poor Papa! SHEBA. Poor dear Papa! SALOME. He must return very soon--he must! SHEBA. He must! In the meantime it is such a comfort to feel that we have no cause for self-reproach. SALOME. But the anxiety is terribly wearing. SHEBA. Nothing is so weakening, Salome. SALOME. Sheba, dear. SHEBA. [_Clinging to SALOME._] If I should pine and ultimately die of this suspense I want you to have my workbox. SALOME. [_Shaking her head and sadly turning away._] Thank you, dear, but if Papa is not home for afternoon tea you will outlive me. [_Turning towards the window as MAJOR TARVER and MR. DARBEY appear outside._ DARBEY. [_Outside._] Miss Jedd! Miss Jedd! SALOME. Sheba! Here are Gerald Tarver and Mr. Darbey! SHEBA. Oh, the presumption! Open the window and dare them to enter! [_SALOME unfastens the window._ DARBEY. [_Outside._] Thank you. Don't be shocked when you see Tarver. _TARVER and DARBEY enter, dressed for the Races, but DARBEY is supporting TARVER, who looks extremely weakly._ TARVER. Pardon this informal method of presenting ourselves. SALOME. You do well, gentlemen, to intrude upon two feeble women at a moment of sorrow. SHEBA. One step further, and I shall ask Major Tarver, who is nearest the bell, to ring for help. [_TARVER sinks into a chair._ DARBEY. [_Standing by the side of TARVER._] There now. The fact is. Miss Jedd, that Tarver is in an exceedingly critical condition. Feeling that he has incurred your displeasure he has failed even in the struggle to gain the race-course. I have taken him to Dr. Middleton and I explained that Major Tarver loved with a passion [_looking at SHEBA_] second only to my own. SALOME. [_Sitting comfortably on the settee._] Oh, we cannot listen to you, Mr. Darbey. SHEBA. Go on, sir, if you can. [_The two girls exchange looks._ DARBEY. The Doctor made a searching examination of the Major's tongue and diagnosed that, unless the Major at once proposed to the lady in question and was accepted, three weeks or a month at the seaside would be absolutely imperative. Shall I continue? SALOME. Oh, certainly. I am helpless. SHEBA. We are curious to see to",

Shall I continue? SALOME. Oh, certainly. I am helpless. SHEBA. We are curious to see to what lengths you will go. DARBEY. The pitiable condition of my poor friend speaks for itself. SALOME. I beg your pardon--it does nothing of the kind. TARVER. [_Rising with difficulty and approaching SALOME._] Salome--I have loved you distractedly for upwards of eight weeks. SALOME. [_Going to him._] Oh, Major Tarver, let me pass; [_holding his coat firmly_] let me pass, I say. TARVER. Unless you push me, never! SHEBA. Spare me this scene, Mr. Darbey. [_DARBEY follows SHEBA across the room._ TARVER. To a man in my condition love is either a rapid and fatal malady, or it is an admirable digestive. Accept me, and my merry laugh once more rings through the Mess Room. Reject me, and my collection of vocal music, loose and in volumes, will be brought to the hammer, and the bird, as it were, will trill no more. SALOME. And is it really I who would hush the little throaty songster? TARVER. Certainly. [_Taking a sheet of paper from his pocket._] I have the Doctor's certificate to that effect. [_Both reading the certificate they walk into Library._ SHEBA. Oh, Mr. Darbey, I have never thought of marriage seriously. DARBEY. People never do till they _are_ married. SHEBA. But think, only think of my age. DARBEY. Pardon me, Sheba--but what is your age? SHEBA. Oh, it is so very little--it is not worth mentioning. Cannot we remain friends and occasionally correspond? DARBEY. Well, of course--if you insist---- SHEBA. No, no, I see that is impracticable. It must be wed or part. All I ask is time--time to ponder over such a question, time to know myself better. DARBEY. Certainly, how long? SHEBA. Give me two or three minutes. Hush! [_They separate as TARVER and SALOME re-enter the room. TARVER is glaring excitedly and biting his nails._ TARVER. I never thought I should live to be accepted by anyone. I shall buy some gay songs. Er--when can I see the Dean? SALOME. Oh, don't! TARVER. Salome! SALOME. Papa has been out all night. DARBEY _and_ TARVER. All night? SALOME. Isn't it terrible! Oh, what do you think of it,",

Yes, they came yesterday in a hamper labeled \"Miss Jedd, Secretary, Cast-off Clothing Distribution League.\" TARVER. That was my idea--came to me in the middle of the night. SALOME. Dear Major Tarver, surely this terrible strain on your nerves is very, very bad for you with your--your---- TARVER. My liver--say the word, Miss Jedd. SALOME. [_Drooping her head._] Oh, Major Tarver! TARVER. It is frightfully injurious. Of course I'm excited now, and you see me at my best, but the alternating fits of hopeless despondency are shocking to witness and to endure! SALOME. Oh! TARVER. It's all that damned India! Oh! what have I said! You will never forgive me. SALOME. Indeed, indeed I will! TARVER. Never. Oh, Miss Jedd, my forgetfulness has brought me--one of my--terrible attacks--of depression! SALOME. Major Tarver! [_She leads him to a chair into which he sinks in a ghastly state.
