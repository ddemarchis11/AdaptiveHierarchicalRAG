  "question": "In the context of the Anglo-Saxon manuscript housed in the British Museum, what connections can be drawn between the depiction of the harp—rendered from the biblical kinnor that David used to suspend—and ancient musical traditions, particularly those linking biblical and early medieval music?",
  "gold_answer": "The kinnor, which David used to suspend, is rendered as a harp found in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript in the British museum, connecting biblical and early medieval musical traditions.",
  "llm_answer": "The Anglo-Saxon manuscript housed in the British Museum, which depicts King David playing the harp, provides valuable insights into the connections between ancient musical traditions, particularly those linking biblical and early medieval music. Here are some connections that can be drawn:\n\n1. **Biblical origins**: The depiction of King David playing the harp is a direct reference to the biblical account of David's musical talents (1 Samuel 16:23, 18:10, 21:11). This highlights the importance of biblical music in Anglo-Saxon culture and the influence of biblical traditions on early medieval music.\n2. **Kinnor and harp**: The harp depicted in the manuscript is likely a representation of the kinnor, a stringed instrument mentioned in the Bible as the instrument of choice for King David (1 Samuel 16:23, 18:10). The kinnor was a lyre-like instrument with a triangular shape, which is consistent with the harp depicted in the manuscript.\n3. **Ancient musical traditions**: The depiction of King David playing the harp suggests that ancient musical traditions, such as those of the Hebrews and other ancient Near Eastern cultures, continued to influence early medieval music. The harp was a popular instrument in ancient cultures, and its depiction in the manuscript highlights its enduring significance in musical traditions.\n4. **Medieval musical instruments**: The harp depicted in the manuscript is also a precursor to the medieval musical instruments, such as the cithara and the psalterium, which were popular in Europe during the Middle Ages. The harp's triangular shape and the use of strings to produce sound are characteristic features of these instruments.\n5. **Anglo-Saxon musical culture**: The depiction of King David playing the harp in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript suggests that Anglo-Saxon musical culture was influenced by biblical and early medieval musical traditions. The harp was a popular instrument in Anglo-Saxon culture, and its depiction in the manuscript highlights its significance in medieval music.\n6. **Symbolism and iconography**: The harp depicted in the manuscript is also a symbol of music, poetry, and wisdom in biblical and medieval cultures. The harp's association with King David, a biblical figure known for his musical talents and wisdom, reinforces its symbolic significance in medieval music.\n7. **Continuity and evolution**: The depiction of King David playing the harp in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript highlights the continuity between ancient and medieval musical traditions. The harp's evolution from the kinnor to the medieval instruments, such as the cithara and the psalterium, demonstrates the gradual changes that occurred in musical instruments over time.\n\nIn conclusion, the Anglo-Saxon manuscript housed in the British Museum provides valuable insights into the connections between ancient musical traditions, particularly those linking biblical and early medieval music. The depiction of King David playing the harp highlights the significance of biblical music in Anglo-Saxon culture, the influence of ancient musical traditions on early medieval music, and the continuity between ancient and medieval musical traditions.",

[Illustration] A small psalterium with strings placed over a sound-board was apparently the prototype of the _citole_; a kind of dulcimer which was played with the fingers. The names were not only often vaguely applied by the mediæval writers but they changed also in almost every century. The psalterium, or psalterion (Italian _salterio_, English _psaltery_), of the fourteenth century and later had the trapezium shape of the dulcimer. [Illustration] The Anglo-saxons frequently accompanied their vocal effusions with a harp, more or less triangular in shape,--an instrument which may be considered rather as constituting the transition of the lyre into the harp. The representation of king David playing the harp is from an Anglo-saxon manuscript of the beginning of the eleventh century, in the British museum. The harp was especially popular in central and northern Europe, and was the favourite instrument of the German and Celtic bards and of the Scandinavian skalds. In the next illustration from the manuscript of the monastery of St. Blasius twelve strings and two sound holes are given to it. A harp similar in form and size, but without the front pillar, was known to the ancient Egyptians. Perhaps the addition was also non-existent in the earliest specimens appertaining to European nations; and a sculptured figure of a small harp constructed like the ancient eastern harp has been discovered in the old church of Ullard in the county of Kilkenny. Of this curious relic, which is said to date from a period anterior to the year 800, a fac-simile taken from Bunting’s “Ancient Music of Ireland” is given (p. 91). As Bunting was the first who drew attention to this sculpture his account of it may interest the reader. “The drawing” he says “is taken from one of the ornamental compartments of a sculptured cross, at the old church of Ullard. From the style of the workmanship, as well as from the worn condition of the cross, it seems older than the similar monument at Monasterboice which is known to have been set up before the year 830. The sculpture is rude; the circular rim which binds the arms of the cross together is not pierced in the quadrants, and many of the figures originally in relievo are now wholly abraded. It is difficult to determine whether the number of strings represented is six or seven; but, as has been already remarked, accuracy in this respect cannot be expected either in sculptures or in many picturesque drawings.” The Finns had a harp (_harpu_, _kantele_) with",

As regards the musical instruments of the Hebrews, we are from biblical records acquainted with the names of many of them; but representations to be trusted are still wanting, and it is chiefly from an examination of the ancient Egyptian and Assyrian instruments that we can conjecture almost to a certainty their construction and capabilities. From various indications, which it would be too circumstantial here to point out, we believe the Hebrews to have possessed the following instruments: THE HARP. There cannot be a doubt that the Hebrews possessed the harp, seeing that it was a common instrument among the Egyptians and Assyrians. But it is uncertain which of the Hebrew names of the stringed instruments occurring in the Bible really designates the harp. THE DULCIMER. Some writers on Hebrew music consider the _nebel_ to have been a kind of dulcimer; others conjecture the same of the _psanterin_ mentioned in the book of Daniel,--a name which appears to be synonymous with the _psalterion_ of the Greeks, and from which also the present oriental dulcimer, _santir_, may have been derived. Some of the instruments mentioned in the book of Daniel may have been synonymous with some which occur in other parts of the Bible under Hebrew names; the names given in Daniel being Chaldæan. The _asor_ was a ten-stringed instrument played with a plectrum, and is supposed to have borne some resemblance to the _nebel_. THE LYRE. This instrument is represented on some Hebrew coins generally ascribed to Judas Maccabæus, who lived in the second century before the Christian era. There are several of them in the British museum; some are of silver, and the others of copper. On three of them are lyres with three strings, another has one with five, and another one with six strings. The two sides of the frame appear to have been made of the horns of animals, or they may have been of wood formed in imitation of two horns which originally were used. Lyres thus constructed are still found in Abyssinia. The Hebrew square-shaped lyre of the time of Simon Maccabæus is probably identical with the _psalterion_. The _kinnor_, the favourite instrument of king David, was most likely a lyre if not a small triangular harp. The lyre was evidently an universally known and favoured instrument among ancient eastern nations. Being more simple in construction than most other stringed instruments it undoubtedly preceded them in antiquity. The _kinnor_ is mentioned in the Bible as the oldest stringed instrument, and as the invention of Jubal. Even if the name of one particular stringed instrument is here used for stringed instruments in general, which may possibly be the case, it is only reasonable to suppose that the oldest and most universally known stringed instrument would be",

      "text": "It is difficult to determine whether the number of strings represented is six or seven; but, as has been already remarked, accuracy in this respect cannot be expected either in sculptures or in many picturesque drawings.” The Finns had a harp (_harpu_, _kantele_) with a similar frame, devoid of a front pillar, still in use until the commencement of the present century. [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration] One of the most interesting stringed instruments of the middle ages is the _rotta_ (German, _rotte_; English, _rote_). It was sounded by twanging the strings, and also by the application of the bow. The first method was, of course, the elder one. There can hardly be a doubt that when the bow came into use it was applied to certain popular instruments which previously had been treated like the _cithara_ or the _psalterium_. The Hindus at the present day use their _suroda_ sometimes as a lute and sometimes as a fiddle. In some measure we do the same with the violin by playing occasionally _pizzicato_. The _rotta_ (shown p. 91) from the manuscript of St. Blasius is called in Gerbert’s work _cithara teutonica_, while the harp is called _cithara anglica_; from which it would appear that the former was regarded as pre-eminently a German instrument. Possibly its name may have been originally _chrotta_ and the continental nations may have adopted it from the Celtic races of the British isles, dropping the guttural sound. This hypothesis is, however, one of those which have been advanced by some musical historians without any satisfactory evidence. [Illustration] [Illustration] We engrave also another representation of David playing on the _rotta_, from a psalter of the seventh century in the British museum (Cott. Vesp. A. I). According to tradition, this psalter is one of the manuscripts which were sent by pope Gregory to St. Augustine. The instrument much resembles the lyre in the hand of the musician (see p. 22) who is supposed to be a Hebrew of the time of Joseph. In the _rotta_ the ancient Asiatic lyre is easily to be recognized. An illumination of king David playing the _rotta_ forms the frontispiece of a manuscript of the eighth century preserved in the cathedral library of Durham; and which is musically interesting inasmuch as it represents a _rotta_ of an oblong square shape like that just noticed and resembling the Welsh _crwth_. It has only five strings which the performer twangs with his fingers. Again, a very interesting representation (which we engrave) of the Psalmist with a kind of _rotta_ occurs in a manuscript of the tenth century, in the British museum",

      "text": "It is, therefore, perhaps not surprising that no material improvement is perceptible in the construction of the instruments of European countries during the lapse of nearly a thousand years. True, evidences to be relied on referring to the first five or six centuries of the Christian era are but scanty; although indications are not wanting which may help the reflecting musician. [Illustration] [Illustration] There are some early monuments of Christian art dating from the fourth century in which the lyre is represented. In one of them Christ is depicted as Apollo touching the lyre. This instrument occurs at an early period in western Europe as used in popular pastimes. In an Anglo-saxon manuscript of the ninth century in the British museum (Cleopatra C. VIII.) are the figures of two gleemen, one playing the lyre and the other a double-pipe. M. de Coussemaker has published in the “Annales Archéologiques” the figure of a crowned personage playing the lyre, which he found in a manuscript of the ninth or tenth century in the library at Angers. The player twangs the strings with his fingers, while the Anglo-saxon gleeman before mentioned uses a plectrum. _Cithara_ was a name applied to several stringed instruments greatly varying in form, power of sound, and compass. The illustration represents a cithara from a manuscript of the ninth century, formerly in the library of the great monastery of St. Blasius in the Black Forest. When in the year 1768 the monastery was destroyed by fire, this valuable book perished in the flames; fortunately the celebrated abbot Gerbert possessed tracings of the illustrations, which were saved from destruction. He published them, in the year 1774, in his work “De cantu et musica sacra.” Several illustrations in the following pages, it will be seen, have been derived from this interesting source. As the older works on music were generally written in Latin we do not learn from them the popular names of the instruments; the writers merely adopted such Latin names as they thought the most appropriate. Thus, for instance, a very simple stringed instrument of a triangular shape, and a somewhat similar one of a square shape were designated by the name of _psalterium_; and we further give a woodcut of the square kind (p. 86), and of a _cithara_ (above) from the same manuscript. [Illustration] [Illustration] This last instrument is evidently an improvement upon the triangular psalterium, because it has a sort of small sound-board at the top. Scarcely better, with regard to acoustics, appears to have been the instrument designated as _nablum_, which we engrave (p. 87) from a manuscript of the ninth century at Angers.
