There is the sound of falling rain and distant thunder._] Rain, thunder. How it assimilates with the tempest of my mind! I'll read. Bless me! This is very strange. [_Reading._] \"The Horse and its Ailments, by John Cox, M. R. C. V. S.\" It was with the aid of this volume that I used to doctor my old mare at Oxford. A leaf turned down. [_Reading._] \"Simple remedies for chills--the Bolus.\" The helpless beast in my stable is suffering from a chill. Good gracious! If I allow Blore to risk my fifty pounds on Dandy Dick, surely it would be advisable to administer this Bolus to the poor animal without delay. [_Referring to the book hastily._] I have these drugs in my chest. There's not a moment to be lost! [_Going to the bell and ringing._] I shall want help. I'll fetch my medicine chest. [_He lays the book upon the table and goes into the Library._ _BLORE enters._ BLORE. [_Looking round._] Where is he? The bell rang. The Dean's puzzling me with his uncommon behavior, that he is. [_THE DEAN comes from the Library, carrying a large medicine chest. On encountering BLORE he starts and turns away his head, the picture of guilt._ THE DEAN. Blore, I feel it would be a humane act to administer to the poor ignorant animal in my stable a simple Bolus as a precaution against chill. I rely upon your aid and discretion in ministering to any guest in the Deanery. BLORE. [_In a whisper._] I see, sir--you ain't going to lose half a chance for to-morrow, sir--you're a knowin' one, sir, as the sayin' goes! THE DEAN. [_Shrinking from BLORE with a groan._] Oh! [_He places the medicine chest on the table and takes up the book. Handing the book to BLORE with his finger on a page._] Fetch these humble but necessary articles from the kitchen--quick. I'll mix the Bolus here. [_BLORE goes out quickly._] It is exactly seven and twenty years since I last approached a horse medically. [_He takes off his coat and lays it on a chair, then rolls his shirt-sleeves up above his elbows and puts on his glasses._] I trust that this Bolus will not give the animal an unfair advantage over his competitors. I don't desire that! I don't desire that! [_BLORE re-enters carrying a tray, on which",

My man Hatcham is running him up and down the lane here to try to get him warm again. GEORGIANA. Where are you going to put the homeless beast up now? SIR TRISTRAM. I don't know. GEORGIANA.

SIR TRISTRAM. I believe you. [_Pointing to the paper._] Strychnine! Sixteen grains! SALOME _and_ SHEBA. [_Clinging to each other terrified._] Oh! THE DEAN. Strychnine! Summon my devoted servant Blore, in whose presence the innocuous mixture was compounded. [_GEORGIANA rings the bell. The girls hide behind the window curtains._] This analysis is simply the pardonable result of over-enthusiasm on the part of our local chemist. GEORGIANA. You're a disgrace to the pretty little police station where you slept last night! [_BLORE enters and stands unnoticed._ THE DEAN. I will prove that in the Deanery Stables the common laws of hospitality have never been transgressed. Give me the bowl!

I, myself, am suffering from the exposure of last night. [_Taking the remaining bolus and opening his mouth._] Observe me! BLORE. [_Rushing forward, snatching the basin from THE DEAN and sinking on to his knees._] No, no! Don't, don't! You wouldn't 'ang the holdest servant in the Deanery. THE DEAN. Blore! BLORE. I did it! I 'ad a honest fancy for Bonny Betsy, and I wanted this gentleman's 'orse out of the way. And while you was mixing the dose with the best ecclesiastical intentions, I hintroduced a foreign element. THE DEAN. [_Pulling BLORE up by his coat collar._] Viper! BLORE. Oh sir, it was hall for the sake of the Dean. SIR TRISTRAM. The Dean? BLORE. The dear Dean had only Fifty Pounds to spare for sporting purposes, and I thought a gentleman of 'is 'igh standing ought to have a certainty. SIR TRISTRAM. Jedd! GEORGIANA. Augustin! THE DEAN. I can conceal it no longer--I--I instructed this unworthy creature to back Dandy Dick on behalf of the Restoration Fund. SIR TRISTRAM. [_Shaking BLORE._] And didn't you do it? BLORE. No. THE DEAN.

I've cooked Dandy Dick! [_He moves from the table in horror._] Oh! I'm only a hamatoor sportsman and I can't afford a uncertainty.
