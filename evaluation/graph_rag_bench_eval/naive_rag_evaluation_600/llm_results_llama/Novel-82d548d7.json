  "question": "Drawing from Augustus Le Plongeon's analysis in 'Vestiges of the Mayas,' what evidence is presented for connections between the Mayas and the Egyptians, and what relationships or comparisons are described between the Mayas and the civilizations of the Asiatic peninsulas?",
  "gold_answer": "The Mayas had many customs and attainments identical to those of the Egyptians, were compared to the Egyptians, and had relations with Asiatic peninsulas.",
  "llm_answer": "According to Augustus Le Plongeon's analysis in 'Vestiges of the Mayas,' the following evidence and relationships are presented:\n\n**Connections between the Mayas and the Egyptians:**\n\n1. **Similar customs and attainments**: Le Plongeon notes that many customs and attainments of the Egyptians are identical to those of the Mayas.\n2. **Monumental architecture**: The monuments of the Mayas, such as those in Ake, show a level of sophistication and grandeur similar to that of the Egyptians.\n3. **Hieroglyphic writings**: Le Plongeon observes that the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a \"Lord\" or \"Master\" is the image of a sieve, which is also used in the hieroglyphic writings of the Mayas.\n4. **Antiquity of the Mayas**: Le Plongeon estimates that the Mayas have a history dating back at least 5,760 years, based on the monument in Ake, which would make them older than the Egyptians.\n\n**Relationships or comparisons between the Mayas and the civilizations of the Asiatic peninsulas:**\n\n1. **Similarities in language**: Le Plongeon notes that the names of tribes and cities in Afghanistan are words belonging to the American Maya language.\n2. **Etymology of the name \"Magi\"**: Le Plongeon suggests that the name \"Magi\" (learned men amongst the Chaldees) has the same meaning as \"Maya\" (magician, astronomer, learned man) in Hindostan.\n3. **Similarities in mythology**: Le Plongeon observes that the name \"Maia\" (goddess, mother of the gods) in Greece is similar to the name \"Maya\" (mother of the gods) in Hindostan.\n4. **Possible connection to MAYAB**: Le Plongeon suggests that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants of the valley of the Nile may have come from MAYAB (a country in Central America), based on the use of the sieve symbol in Egyptian hieroglyphics.\n\nHowever, Le Plongeon also notes that the Mayas did not receive their civilization from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, as the similarities between the Mayas and the Asiatic civilizations are too few to justify this assertion. Instead, he suggests that the Mayas and the Asiatic civilizations may have had relations and exchanged customs and ideas at some point in the past.",

BY AUGUSTUS LE PLONGEON, M. D., Member of the American Antiquarian Society of Worcester, Mass., of the California Academy of Sciences, and several other Scientific Societies. Author of various Essays and Scientific Works. NEW YORK: JOHN POLHEMUS, PRINTER AND STATIONER, 102 NASSAU STREET. 1881. To _MR. PIERRE LORILLARD._ Who deserves the thanks of the students of American Archaeology more than you, for the interest manifested in the explorations of the ruined monuments of Central America, handiwork of the races that inhabited this continent in remote ages, and the material help given by you to Foreign and American explorers in that field of investigations? Accept, then, my personal thanks, with the dedication of this small Essay. It forms part of the result of many years' study and hardships among the ruined cities of the Incas, in Peru, and of the Mayas in Yucatan. Yours very respectfully, AUGUSTUS LE PLONGEON, M. D. NEW YORK, _December 15, 1881_. Entered according to an Act of Congress, in December, 1881, BY AUGUSTUS LE PLONGEON, In the Office of the LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS in Washington, D.C. VESTIGES OF THE MAYAS. Yucatan is the peninsula which divides the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean Sea. It is comprised between the 17 deg. 30' and 21 deg. 50', of latitude north, and the 88 deg. and 91 deg. of longitude west from the Greenwich meridian. The whole peninsula is of fossiferous limestone formation. Elevated a few feet only above the sea, on the coasts, it gradually raises",

It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion. They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them at some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and beliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days. This appears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American. The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced by many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their civilization from Egypt and Asia Minor. On the contrary. It is true that I have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians were identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites and habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed towards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still in MAYAB. Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective antiquity of the two nations. According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by the Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C. Well, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists still a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_. Each of these columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the life of the nation. They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened between the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of the uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the structure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the thirty-sixth column. How long did that event occur before the Spanish conquest it is impossible to surmise. Supposing, however, it did take place at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years since, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being finished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the nation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day. I will remark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third person of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his finger to his mouth. AKE also means a _reed_. To-day the meaning of the word is lost in Yucatan. Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which they computed time, says: \"They counted",

They were no less astonished to meet in the inhabitants, not naked savages, but a civilized people, possessed of polite and pleasant manners, dressed in white cotton habiliments, navigating large boats propelled by sails, traveling on well constructed roads and causeways that, in point of beauty and solidity, could compare advantageously with similar Roman structures in Spain, Italy, England or France. I will not describe here the majestic monuments raised by the Mayas. Mrs. Le Plongeon, in her letters to the _New York World_, has given of those of UXMAL, AKE and MAYAPAN, the only correct description ever published. My object at present is to relate some of the curious facts revealed to us by their weather-beaten and crumbling walls, and show how erroneous is the opinion of some European scientists, who think it not worth while to give a moment of their precious time to the study of American archaeology, because say they: _No relations have ever been found to have existed between the monuments and civilizations of the inhabitants of this continent and those of the old world_. On what ground they hazard such an opinion it is difficult to surmise, since to my knowledge the ancient ruined cities of Yucatan, until lately, have never been thoroughly, much less scientifically, explored. The same is true of the other monumental ruins of the whole of Central America. When Mrs. Le Plongeon and myself landed at Progresso, in 1873, we thought that because we had read the works of Stephens, Waldeck, Norman, Fredeichstal; carefully examined the few photographic views made by Mr. Charnay of some of the monuments, we knew all about them. Alas! vain presumption! When in presence of the antique shrines and palaces of the Mayas, we soon saw how mistaken we had been; how little those writers had seen of the monuments they had pretended to describe: that the work of studying them systematically was not even begun; and that many years of close observation and patient labor would be necessary in order to dispel the mysteries which hang over them, and to discover the hidden meaning of their ornaments and inscriptions. To this difficult task we resolved to dedicate our time, and to concentrate our efforts to find a solution, if possible, to the enigma. We began our work by taking photographs of all the monuments in their _tout ensemble_, and in all their details, as much as practicable. Next, we surveyed them carefully; made accurate plans of them in order to be able to comprehend by the disposition of their different parts, for what possible use they were erected; taking, as a starting point, that the human mind and human inclinations and wants are the same in all times, in all countries, in all races when civilized and",

      "text": "American Maya language. They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established himself there. We do not find the etymology of his name in any book where mention is made of it. We are merely told that he was a wise magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura (demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men. Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are words belonging to the American Maya language. Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst the Chaldees. We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man. If we come to Greece, where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis. But if we come to the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a sieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time. Its inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called themselves _Mayas_. It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a _Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve. Would not this seem to indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land, were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with the sign of land? We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent men and women after their death. This worship of their heroes they undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and Greece. It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion. They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed",
