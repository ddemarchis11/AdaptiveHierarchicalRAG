The baby ran its arms more closely around Raegen's neck and did not speak, unless its cooing in Raegen's ear was an answer. \"What did you say your name was?\" persisted Raegen, in a whisper. The baby frowned at this and stopped cooing long enough to say: \"Marg'ret,\" mechanically and without apparently associating the name with herself or anything else. \"Margaret, eh!\" said Raegen, with grave consideration. \"It's a very pretty name,\" he added, politely, for he could not shake off the feeling that he was in the presence of a superior being. \"An' what did you say your dad's name was?\" asked Raegen, awkwardly. But this was beyond the baby's patience or knowledge, and she waived the question aside with both arms and began to beat a tattoo gently with her two closed fists on Raegen's chin and throat. \"You're mighty strong now, ain't you?\" mocked the young giant, laughing. \"Perhaps you don't know, Missie,\" he added, gravely, \"that your dad and mar are doing time on the Island, and you won't see 'em again for a month.\" No, the baby did not know this nor care apparently; she seemed content with Rags and with his company. Sometimes she drew away and looked at him long and dubiously, and this cut Rags to the heart, and he felt guilty, and unreasonably anxious until she smiled reassuringly again and ran back into his arms, nestling her face against his and stroking his rough chin wonderingly with her little fingers. Rags forgot the lateness of the night and the darkness that fell upon the room in the interest of this strange entertainment, which was so much more absorbing, and so much more innocent than any other he had ever known. He almost forgot the fact that he lay in hiding, that he was surrounded by unfriendly neighbors, and that at any moment the representatives of local justice might come in and rudely lead him away. For this reason he dared not make a light, but he moved his position so that the glare from an electric lamp on the street outside might fall across the baby's face, as it lay alternately dozing and awakening, to smile up at him in the bend of his arm. Once it reached inside the collar of his shirt and pulled out the scapular that hung around his neck, and looked at it so long, and with such apparent seriousness, that Rags was confirmed in his fear that this kindly visitor was something more or less of a superhuman agent, and his efforts to make this supposition coincide with the fact that the angel's parents were on Blackwell's Island, proved",

He did not feel it coming on, or he would have fought against it, but the heat of the day and the sleeplessness of the night before, and the fumes of the whiskey on his empty stomach, drew him unconsciously into a dull stupor, so that the paper fan slipped from his hand, and he sank back on the bedding into a heavy sleep. When he awoke it was nearly dusk and past six o'clock, as he knew by the newsboys calling the sporting extras on the street below. He sprang up, cursing himself, and filled with bitter remorse. \"I'm a drunken fool, that's what I am,\" said Rags, savagely. \"I've let her lie here all day in the heat with no one to watch her.\" Margaret was breathing so softly that he could hardly discern any life at all, and his heart almost stopped with fear. He picked her up and fanned and patted her into wakefulness again and then turned desperately to the window and looked down. There was no one he knew or who knew him as far as he could tell on the street, and he determined recklessly to risk another sortie for food. \"Why, it's been near two days that child's gone without eating,\" he said, with keen self-reproach, \"and here you've let her suffer to save yourself a trip to the Island. You're a hulking big loafer, you are,\" he ran on, muttering, \"and after her coming to you and taking notice of you and putting her face to yours like an angel.\" He slipped off his shoes and picked his way cautiously down the stairs. As he reached the top of the first flight a newsboy passed, calling the evening papers, and shouted something which Rags could not distinguish. He wished he could get a copy of the paper. It might tell him, he thought, something about himself. The boy was coming nearer, and Rags stopped and leaned forward to listen. \"Extry! Extry!\" shouted the newsboy, running. \"Sun, World, and Mail. Full account of the murder of Pike McGonegal by Ragsey Raegen.\" The lights in the street seemed to flash up suddenly and grow dim again, leaving Rags blind and dizzy. \"Stop,\" he yelled, \"stop. Murdered, no, by God, no,\" he cried, staggering half-way down the stairs; \"stop, stop!\" But no one heard Rags, and the sound of his own voice halted him. He sank back weak and sick upon the top step of the stairs and beat his hands together upon his head. \"It's a lie,",

If I only wasn't under bonds,\" he muttered, as he slipped down the stairs. \"If it wasn't for that they couldn't give me more'n a month at the most, even knowing all they do of me. It was only a street fight, anyway, and there was some there that must have seen him pull his pistol.\" He stopped at the top of the first flight of stairs and sat down to wait. He could see below the top of the open front door, the pavement and a part of the street beyond, and when he heard the rattle of an approaching cart he ran on down and then, with an oath, turned and broke up-stairs again. He had seen the ward detectives standing together on the opposite side of the street. \"Wot are they doing out a bed at this hour?\" he demanded angrily. \"Don't they make trouble enough through the day, without prowling around before decent people are up? I wonder, now, if they're after me.\" He dropped on his knees when he reached the room where the baby lay, and peered cautiously out of the window at the detectives, who had been joined by two other men, with whom they were talking earnestly. Raegen knew the new-comers for two of McGonegal's friends, and concluded, with a momentary flush of pride and self-importance, that the detectives were forced to be up at this early hour solely on his account. But this was followed by the afterthought that he must have hurt McGonegal seriously, and that he was wanted in consequence very much. This disturbed him most, he was surprised to find, because it precluded his going forth in search of food. \"I guess I can't get you that milk I was looking for,\" he said, jocularly, to the baby, for the excitement elated him. \"The sun outside isn't good for me health.\" The baby settled herself in his arms and slept again, which sobered Rags, for he argued it was a bad sign, and his own ravenous appetite warned him how the child suffered. When he again offered her the mixture he had prepared for her, she took it eagerly, and Rags breathed a sigh of satisfaction. Then he ate some of the bread and ham himself and swallowed half the whiskey, and stretched out beside the child and fanned her while she slept. It was something strangely incomprehensible to Rags that he should feel so keen a satisfaction in doing even this little for her, but he gave up wondering, and forgot everything else in watching the strange beauty of the sleeping baby and in the odd feeling of responsibility and self-respect she had brought to him.

This means that they have the power of putting the nerves to sleep. Opium ([=o]'p[)i] [)u]m) is another narcotic. It is a poison made from the juice of poppies, and is used in medicines. Opium is put into soothing-syrups (s[)i]r'[)u]ps), and these are sometimes given to babies to keep them from crying. They do this by injuring the tender nerves and poisoning the little body. How can any one give a baby opium to save taking patient care of it? Surely the mothers would not do it, if they knew that this soothing-syrup that appears like a friend, coming to quiet and comfort the baby, is really an enemy. [Illustration: _Don't give soothing-syrup to children._] Sometimes, a child no older than some of you are, is left at home with the care of a baby brother or sister; so it is best that you should know about this dangerous enemy, and never be tempted to quiet the baby by giving him a poison, instead of taking your best and kindest care of him.

Are you her father?\" she asked, sharply. But Rags did not speak, for at the moment she had answered his question and had said the baby would not die, he had reached out swiftly, and taken the child out of her arms and held it hard against his breast, as though he had lost her and some one had been just giving her back to him. His head was bending over hers, and so he did not see Wade and Heffner, the two ward detectives, as they came in from the street, looking hot, and tired, and anxious. They gave a careless glance at the group, and then stopped with a start, and one of them gave a long, low whistle. \"Well,\" exclaimed Wade, with a gasp of surprise and relief. \"So Raegen, you're here, after all, are you? Well, you did give us a chase, you did. Who took you?\" The men of the reserve squad, when they heard the name of the man for whom the whole force had been looking for the past two days, shifted their positions slightly, and looked curiously at Rags, and the woman stopped pouring out the milk from the bottle in her hand, and stared at him in frank astonishment. Raegen threw back his head and shoulders, and ran his eyes coldly over the faces of the semicircle of men around him. \"Who took me?\" he began defiantly, with a swagger of braggadocio, and then, as though it were hardly worth while, and as though the presence of the baby lifted him above everything else, he stopped, and raised her until her cheek touched his own. It rested there a moment, while Rag stood silent. \"Who took me?\" he repeated, quietly, and without lifting his eyes from the baby's face. \"Nobody took me,\" he said. \"I gave myself up.\" One morning, three months later, when Raegen had stopped his ice-cart in front of my door, I asked him whether at any time he had ever regretted what he had done. \"Well, sir,\" he said, with easy superiority, \"seeing that I've shook the gang, and that the Society's decided her folks ain't fit to take care of her, we can't help thinking we are better off, see? {Illustration with caption: She'd reach out her hands and kiss me.} \"But, as for my ever regretting it, why, even when things was at the worst, when the case was going dead against me, and before that cop, you remember, swore to McGonegal's drawing the pistol, and when I used to sit in the Tombs expecting",
