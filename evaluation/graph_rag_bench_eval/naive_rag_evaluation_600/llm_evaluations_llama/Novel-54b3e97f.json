    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not mention Mr. Starling, who is the individual specified in the Gold Answer as drinking with Mr. Pepys. Instead, it lists other individuals who drank with Mr. Pepys, none of whom are supported by the retrieved context as being relevant to the question. The answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
