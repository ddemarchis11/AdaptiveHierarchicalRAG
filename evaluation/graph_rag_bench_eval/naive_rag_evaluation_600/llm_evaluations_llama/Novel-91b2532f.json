  "llm_answer": "During the period of unrest in Minnesota, several patterns of protest and government response emerged. \n\nProtest patterns:\n\n1. **Protest against traders sitting at the government's pay table**: Indians protested against traders sitting at the government's pay table and deducting from their small annuities the amount due them. They wanted to pay their debts when they got ready, reflecting a desire for control over their financial affairs.\n2. **Protest against government neglect**: Indians claimed that the government had neglected its wards in Minnesota, leading to poverty and suffering among the Indian population.\n3. **Formation of a \"young-man-afraid-of-work\" association**: Some Indians formed a \"young-man-afraid-of-work\" association, which opposed the government's efforts to encourage farming and manual labor among the Indians.\n\nGovernment response:\n\n1. **Government inaction**: The government was initially slow to respond to the Indians' grievances, leading to growing discontent and frustration among the Indian population.\n2. **Military mobilization**: As tensions escalated, the government called upon Minnesota to furnish military regiments, including the Sixth regiment, to quell the unrest and protect the state's white population.\n3. **Use of force**: The government ultimately resorted to force to quell the uprising, with the execution of Little Six and Medicine Bottle, two Sioux chiefs involved in the outbreak, serving as a warning to others.\n4. **Transportation of supplies**: The government faced challenges in transporting supplies to the troops on the frontier, leading to the issuance of orders to impress teams and horses into government service.\n\nThese patterns of protest and government response highlight the complex and often fraught relationship between the government and the Indian population in Minnesota during this period. The government's neglect of its wards and its failure to address Indian grievances contributed to the outbreak of unrest, which ultimately led to the deployment of military forces to quell the uprising.",
