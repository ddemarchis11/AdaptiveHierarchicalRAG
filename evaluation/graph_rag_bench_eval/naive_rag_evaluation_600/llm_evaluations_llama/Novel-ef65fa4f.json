    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifically identifies the Carians as the group with customs similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan. The Model Answer mentions the Carians but also includes several other groups (e.g., Zunis, Hindostan tribes, Chaldeans, Egyptians, etc.) that are not directly relevant to the question or supported by the retrieved context. While the Carians are correctly mentioned, the additional groups dilute the focus and introduce unsupported claims, reducing both faithfulness and evidence coverage."
