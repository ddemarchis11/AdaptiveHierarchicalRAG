He is hired by the Demitt relations to take Suza Fairfield to the backwoods of the Cumberland Mountains, but Suza escapes and returns to Port William, which is located at the mouth of the Kentucky river, where it meets the Ohio river.\n3. After his wife's death, Tom Fairfield moves to the Ohio river with his three little daughters, indicating that the Ohio river becomes a significant part of his life and journey.\n4.
