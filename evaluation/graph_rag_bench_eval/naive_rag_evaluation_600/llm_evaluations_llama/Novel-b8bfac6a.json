  "question": "How did the French Canadians' loyalty to the British crown manifest in times of war?",
  "gold_answer": "French Canadians were loyal to the British crown, which had loyalty from French-Canadian militiamen who fought with English-speaking fellow-countrymen.",
  "llm_answer": "The French Canadians' loyalty to the British crown manifested in several ways during times of war:\n\n1. **Support for the British during the American Revolutionary War**: Although the French Canadians were sympathetic to the American cause, they remained loyal to the British crown. This loyalty was demonstrated by their participation in the Battle of Quebec in 1775, where they fought against the American invaders.\n\n2. **Fighting against American invaders in the War of 1812**: During the War of 1812, French-Canadian militiamen fought alongside their English-speaking fellow-countrymen against American armies. They played a crucial role in several battles, including the Battle of Chateauguay, where they were led by Major Charles-Michel d'Irumberry de Salaberry and successfully repelled the American invasion.\n\n3. **Loyalty to the British during the Napoleonic Wars**: When news of the defeat of the French fleet at Trafalgar reached Canada, a Te Deum was sung in the Catholic cathedral at Quebec, and a future bishop of the French-Canadian Church preached a sermon welcoming the event as a broadening of the gap between France and Canada.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the French Canadians' loyalty to the British crown during times of war, despite their cultural and historical ties to France.",
