    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed account of the Sultan's roles, but it includes several claims not explicitly supported by the retrieved context, such as the Sultan being the head of the orthodox religion and a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. While the Sultan's power over Morocco and his residence in Fez are mentioned, the additional details about symbolic power, governance, and his son's role as Governor are partially grounded but not fully supported by the context. The Gold Answer is concise and focuses on the Sultan's power and palace, which the Model Answer partially addresses but expands beyond the evidence provided."
