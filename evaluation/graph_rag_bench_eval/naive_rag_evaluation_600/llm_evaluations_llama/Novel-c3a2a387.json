  "llm_answer": "According to the novel's account, the city of Mogador was severely affected by both the French and the Berbers during the bombardment and subsequent destruction. Here's a summary of the events:\n\n1. **French bombardment**: The French bombarded the city on August 13, 1844, with a squadron of ships, including the 'Gemappes,' 'Suffren,' 'Triton,' 'Belle Poule,' 'Asmodee,' and 'Pluton.' The bombardment lasted for 28 hours, causing significant damage to the city and its defenses. The Moorish authorities and many of the inhabitants fled, leaving the city unprotected.\n2. **Berber and Arab pillage**: As the French continued to bombard the city, the Berber and Arab tribes, aided by the Moorish rabble, took advantage of the situation to plunder the city from within. They broke into houses, assaulted the inhabitants, murdered those who resisted, and stripped the women of their clothing and ornaments. The Europeans, including the British Consul and his family, were also exposed to these atrocities.\n3. **Wild tribes' rampage**: After the Moorish authorities fled, the wild Berber tribes, led by their desperate chiefs, stormed the city, committing acts of unlicensed ferocity and depredation. They broke into houses, murdered those who resisted, and plundered the city's riches.\n4. **Destruction and abandonment**: The city of Mogador was left a heap of ruins, with scarcely one house standing entire. The inhabitants, including the Jews, were either massacred, buried under the ruins, or forced to flee, leaving the city tenantless.\n\nIn summary, the city of Mogador was severely affected by both the French bombardment and the subsequent pillage and destruction by the Berber and Arab tribes, leaving the city in ruins and its inhabitants either dead or displaced.",
