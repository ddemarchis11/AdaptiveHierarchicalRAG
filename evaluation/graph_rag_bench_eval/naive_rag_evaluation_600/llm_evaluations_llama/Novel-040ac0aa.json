    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed comparison of the Green Man's interactions with Eily and Eileen Macarthy, but it introduces unsupported claims and distinctions not grounded in the retrieved context. For example, the context does not mention differences in the Green Man's size, tone, or demeanor between interactions, nor does it suggest Eily and Eileen are distinct characters with differing levels of understanding or behavior. While the Model Answer captures the core idea of the Green Man meeting Eileen Macarthy, granting Eily a wish, asking questions, and receiving answers, it diverges from the context and gold answer by adding speculative and unsupported details."
