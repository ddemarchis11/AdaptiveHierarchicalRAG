    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that Van Bibber encountered 'A Girl He Knew and her brother,' which is supported by the retrieved context. However, the Gold Answer specifies that the encounter was with 'her brother,' which is a more concise and focused response. The Model Answer includes additional detail about 'A Girl He Knew,' which is not emphasized in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not fully align with the Gold Answer's focus on the brother, leading to partial correctness and evidence coverage."
