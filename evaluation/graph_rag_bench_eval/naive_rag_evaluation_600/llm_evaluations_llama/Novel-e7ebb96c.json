Despite her own lack of ambition for education, Ruth was supportive of her sister's goals and helped Angeline financially when she could. \n\nAngeline often wrote to Ruth, encouraging her to pursue her education and expressing her desire to have Ruth join her at the college. Angeline even offered to help Ruth with her studies and suggested that Ruth could complete her course in two years after joining her at the college.",
