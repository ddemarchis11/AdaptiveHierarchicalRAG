  "llm_answer": "According to the text, the Itzaes, a tribe, retreated before the Nahualt invaders after the surrender and destruction of their cities. They sought refuge in the islands of the lake Peten of to-day, which they called Petenitza, the islands of the Itzaes. They also took refuge in the well-nigh inaccessible valleys, defended by ranges of towering mountains. There, they preserved the customs, manners, language of their forefathers unaltered, in the tract of land known to us as Tierra de Guerra.",
