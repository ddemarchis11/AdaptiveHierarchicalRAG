    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Dr. Elsie Inglis's contributions to medical education and women's rights, aligning with the Gold Answer. It provides additional details, such as her advocacy for equal opportunities and suffrage, which are relevant but not fully supported by the retrieved context. While the context mentions her role in co-founding the Medical College for Women and her involvement in the Women's Liberal League, some claims, like founding the Muir Hall of Residence and advocating for social legislation, are not explicitly grounded in the provided context. Thus, faithfulness and evidence coverage are partially reduced."
