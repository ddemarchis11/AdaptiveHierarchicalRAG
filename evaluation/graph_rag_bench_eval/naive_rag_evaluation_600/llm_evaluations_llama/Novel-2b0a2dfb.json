    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the gardens as a notable feature of Toser, supported by the context. However, it emphasizes the rocky mountain and the spring as notable features, which are not the primary focus of the Gold Answer. While the spring and mountain are relevant to the gardens, the core emphasis on 'gardens' is diluted. The answer is faithful to the context but partially misses the central factual point of the Gold Answer."
