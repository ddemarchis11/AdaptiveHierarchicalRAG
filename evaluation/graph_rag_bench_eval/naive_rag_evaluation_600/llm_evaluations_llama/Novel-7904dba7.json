    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies the notable feature of the settler's cabin as the presence of a lady, which is not supported by the Retrieved Context or the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer specifies 'the cabin had the light,' and the context does not mention the lady as a notable feature that caught the passengers' attention. Therefore, the Model Answer fails in correctness, faithfulness, and evidence coverage."
