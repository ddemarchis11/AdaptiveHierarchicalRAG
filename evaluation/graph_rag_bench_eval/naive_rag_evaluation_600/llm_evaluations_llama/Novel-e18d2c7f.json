    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Dr. O'Shaughnessy spoke to his wife, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, about Eily's mysterious jewels. However, the Gold Answer specifies that he spoke to Dennis Macarthy, and this is supported by the retrieved context. The Model Answer is neither correct nor faithful to the context, and it fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
