  "question": "According to the discussion in the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER about bone flexibility, why are children's bones more flexible and able to bend easily compared to the bones of old people?",
  "gold_answer": "Bones bend easily in children, making their bones more flexible than those of old people.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, children's bones are more flexible and able to bend easily compared to the bones of old people because they contain more gristle. Gristle is a soft part of the bone that is found in children's bones but less in older people's bones. This gristle allows children's bones to bend easily, whereas the bones of old people, which contain more lime, are more brittle and prone to breaking.",
