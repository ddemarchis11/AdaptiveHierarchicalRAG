  "gold_answer": "Boxes",

    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the cupboard and drawer as objects opened by the ill-looking man, which is supported by the context. However, it misses mentioning 'boxes,' which is explicitly stated in the Gold Answer. While the additional details about the drawer's contents are accurate and grounded in the context, the omission of 'boxes' reduces evidence coverage and answer correctness."
