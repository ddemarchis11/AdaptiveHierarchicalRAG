  "question": "In the years following the British conquest of Canada, how did the British government treat the French language in official matters, particularly regarding its use in law-courts and its status relative to English?",
  "gold_answer": "The French language was placed on a level with the English language, and the British government made no objection to the use of French in law-courts.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the text, after the British conquest of Canada, the British government treated the French language with a degree of respect and accommodation. The Quebec Act of 1774 granted the French inhabitants of Canada the whole of the French civil law, to the almost complete exclusion of the English common law. This implied that the use of the French language had been authorized, as it was necessary for the interpretation of the French laws.\n\nIn practice, the British government made no objection to the use of French in the law-courts, suggesting that the French language was tolerated and even recognized as a legitimate medium of communication in official matters.\n\nWhen the question of the official recognition of the French language arose in the Canadian representative Assemblies created by the Act of 1791, the French-Canadian members, who were in a majority, pressed for the official recognition of their language on a parity with English. Although the English members opposed this, the fact that the British government had not previously objected to the use of French in law-courts suggests that the French language was already recognized as a legitimate language of official business.\n\nOverall, the British government's treatment of the French language in official matters was one of accommodation and recognition, rather than suppression or marginalization.",
