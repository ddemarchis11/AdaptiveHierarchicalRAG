    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed account of Dr. Inglis's achievements and recognitions, but it includes unsupported claims such as honorary degrees and specific medals, which are not mentioned in the retrieved context. While the core achievements like founding the Scottish Women's Hospitals and aiding the Serbian Army are correct, the additional details about formal recognitions are speculative and not grounded in the provided context. The evidence coverage is partial as the Model Answer includes some key facts from the Gold Answer but misses others, such as the specific mention of addressing the Sanitary Congress and extending the work of the Red Cross among many nations."
