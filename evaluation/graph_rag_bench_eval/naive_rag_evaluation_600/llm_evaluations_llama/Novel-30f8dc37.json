  "question": "After the journey through the rain and the eventful stop due to the fallen tree, where did the stagecoach carrying Yuba Bill and the passengers finally arrive?",
  "gold_answer": "The coach arrived at the station.",
  "llm_answer": "The text does not explicitly state where the stagecoach finally arrived. However, it mentions that the passengers had a stop at a settler's cabin, where they met the old woman, and that Mr. Ned Brice, one of the passengers, got off the coach and approached the cabin the next morning. This suggests that the stagecoach continued on its journey after the stop due to the fallen tree, but the destination is not specified.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the destination of the stagecoach is not specified, while the Gold Answer clearly states that the coach arrived at the station. The retrieved context does not explicitly contradict the Gold Answer, and the Model Answer fails to align with the core truth provided. Additionally, the Model Answer introduces unsupported speculation about the settler's cabin and Mr. Ned Brice, which is not grounded in the context."
