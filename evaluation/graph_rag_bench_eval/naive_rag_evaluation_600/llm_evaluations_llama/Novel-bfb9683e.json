    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies 'HYGIENE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE' and 'HYGIENIC PHYSIOLOGY' as the books containing a section on TOBACCO, whereas the Gold Answer and Retrieved Context clearly indicate that TOBACCO is part of the 'CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER'. The Model Answer is neither correct nor faithful to the context, and it fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
