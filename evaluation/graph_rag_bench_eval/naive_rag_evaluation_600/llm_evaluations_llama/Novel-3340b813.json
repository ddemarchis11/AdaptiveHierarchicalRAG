    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Fez as a major commercial center with trade connections to Timbuctoo and other parts of Morocco, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it includes additional details about trade with Europe, the Middle East, and the broader African context that are not explicitly supported by the retrieved context. While the retrieved context mentions caravans to Timbuctoo and Mecca, and Fez's role in commerce, it does not substantiate claims about immense trade with Europe or the exchange of ideas and cultures. The Model Answer also misses specific mentions of Tafilett and Touat as key caravan stations, which are present in the context."
