    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Tregeagle's dwelling was in Cornwall, which is a broader location. The Model Answer specifies Dozmare Pool, which is consistent with the Retrieved Context but narrows the location. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context and provides additional detail, it does not fully align with the broader scope of the Gold Answer. Evidence coverage is partial because the Gold Answer's general location ('Cornwall') is not explicitly mentioned in the Model Answer."
