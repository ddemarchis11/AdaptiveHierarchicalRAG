    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies John Neilson as the member who voted against the Ninety-Two Resolutions, whereas the Gold Answer specifies Augustin Cuvillier. The retrieved context does not support the claim about Neilson voting against the Resolutions, nor does it mention Cuvillier. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
