This action shows that my Lord is willing to take responsibility for ensuring that his employees are properly compensated and that he is willing to take the necessary steps to make it happen.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that my Lord is able to delegate tasks and responsibilities to his subordinates, such as Mr. Creed, suggests that he is a confident and effective leader who is able to trust his team members to carry out their duties. This delegation of authority also implies that my Lord has a clear understanding of the tasks that need to be accomplished and is able to assign responsibilities accordingly.\n\nIn addition, the fact that my Lord is able to balance his appreciation for his associates with his authority as a leader is a key aspect of his leadership style. He is able to show gratitude and recognition for the efforts of his team members while also maintaining a sense of control and direction.\n\nOverall, my Lord's actions demonstrate that he is a leader who values loyalty, is decisive, and is able to delegate authority effectively.
