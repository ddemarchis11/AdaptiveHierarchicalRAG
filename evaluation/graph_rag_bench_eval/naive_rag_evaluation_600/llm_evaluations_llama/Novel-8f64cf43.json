    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies a runaway couple as the characters Van Bibber recognized at the French restaurant near Washington Square, whereas the Gold Answer specifies that Van Bibber saw Standish. The retrieved context does not support the claim about the runaway couple being the recognized character, and the key fact from the Gold Answer is entirely missed."
