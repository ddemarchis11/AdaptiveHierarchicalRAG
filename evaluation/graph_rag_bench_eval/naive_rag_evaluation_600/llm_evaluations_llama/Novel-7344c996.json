  "question": "How does the coke fire contribute to the revivification of bone-black within the furnace system?",
  "gold_answer": "The coke fire produces flames that heat the retorts, which are used to revivify bone-black.",
  "llm_answer": "The coke fire contributes to the revivification of bone-black within the furnace system by providing heat to the retorts and the surrounding area. The flames from the coke fire spread throughout the fire chamber, direct themselves toward the bottom, and then divide into two parts to the right and left, heating the back of the retorts in passing. The two currents of flames then mount through the lateral flues and unite to form one current in the drier. This heat is used to break the current from the flames, allowing it to heat all the inner parts of the pipes, while the apertures in the drier allow for the escape of steam. The heat from the coke fire is also used to revivify the bone-black, which is then cooled and processed further in the system.",
