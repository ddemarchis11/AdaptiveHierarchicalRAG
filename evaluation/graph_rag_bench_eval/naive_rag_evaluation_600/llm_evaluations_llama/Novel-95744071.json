  "question": "During the period of exile and revolutionary agitation following the initial rebellion, with which fellow leader did Papineau break off negotiations regarding the future of the Patriote movement?",
  "gold_answer": "Papineau broke off negotiations with Robert Nelson.",
  "llm_answer": "The text does not explicitly mention Papineau breaking off negotiations with a fellow leader during the period of exile and revolutionary agitation following the initial rebellion. However, it does mention that Papineau broke off with John Neilson, who had been a strong supporter of Papineau, due to Neilson's opposition to Papineau's views and actions.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies John Neilson as the leader Papineau broke off negotiations with, whereas the Gold Answer specifies Robert Nelson. The retrieved context does not provide explicit support for the claim about Neilson in relation to the question, nor does it mention Robert Nelson in this specific context. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
