  "gold_answer": "Uncle Toby is compared with Tellheim in literary analysis.",
  "llm_answer": "During literary analysis, Uncle Toby is compared to Tellheim, a character from Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's play \"Minna von Barnhelm\".",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 1.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.5,
    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Tellheim as the character Uncle Toby is compared to, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, the retrieved context does not explicitly confirm this comparison, making the faithfulness score lower. The evidence coverage is complete as the key fact (Tellheim) is included."
