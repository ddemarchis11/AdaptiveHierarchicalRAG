  "llm_answer": "The incident that demonstrates Samuel Pepys's professional responsibilities is when the Duke of York sent him an official order to give an account of where the fault lay in the not sending out of the ships. This occurred on June 30th, 1661, as recorded in the diary entry for that day.\n\nAccording to the diary, Pepys and Sir Williams went to Whitehall, where they met with the Duke of York, and gave him an account of the situation. They found that the fault lay in the wind, which had been against the ships, preventing them from getting out of the river.\n\nThis incident shows that Pepys was involved in the administration of the navy and was responsible for reporting to the Duke of York, a high-ranking official, on matters related to the ships and their operations.",
