    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not explicitly state that Wolfred Nelson was held as a prisoner in Montreal, which is the core fact of the Gold Answer.

The Model Answer is partially correct in mentioning his arrest and imprisonment but fails to address the specific location, which is the key fact required."
