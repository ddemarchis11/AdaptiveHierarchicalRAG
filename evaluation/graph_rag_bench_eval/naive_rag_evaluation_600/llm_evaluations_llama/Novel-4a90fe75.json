  "llm_answer": "The primary home for Toto and his grandmother is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies 'Cottage' as the primary home for Toto and his grandmother, but the Model Answer does not definitively state this and instead speculates about the setting being a house or cottage in a forest. The retrieved context does not explicitly confirm the term 'Cottage,' making the Model Answer unfaithful to the context. While the Model Answer partially aligns with the Gold Answer by suggesting a house or cottage, it fails to provide the exact term 'Cottage,' reducing evidence coverage."
