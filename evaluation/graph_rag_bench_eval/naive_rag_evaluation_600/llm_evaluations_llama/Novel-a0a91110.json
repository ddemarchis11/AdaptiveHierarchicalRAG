  "gold_answer": "The British Museum has cymbals used by Egyptian musicians; Assyrian musicians played the dulcimer, known as santir.",
  "llm_answer": "There is no information provided in the given context about the British Museum's collection of cymbals and its relationship to the musical instrument santir.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about the relationship between the British Museum's cymbals and the santir. However, the Gold Answer explicitly mentions that the British Museum has cymbals used by Egyptian musicians and that Assyrian musicians played the dulcimer, known as santir. The Model Answer fails to address this relationship, resulting in a score of 0 for correctness and evidence coverage, despite being faithful to the context."
