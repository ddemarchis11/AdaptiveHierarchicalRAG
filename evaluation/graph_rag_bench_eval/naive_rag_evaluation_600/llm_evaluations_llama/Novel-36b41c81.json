  "gold_answer": "Coal dust is mixed with grains.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the text, coal dust is mixed with broken coal pitch in the proportion of eight to ten percent of the coal.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that coal dust is mixed with broken coal pitch, which is supported by the retrieved context. However, the Gold Answer specifies that coal dust is mixed with grains, which is not mentioned in the Model Answer. Therefore, the Model Answer does not align with the Gold Answer and misses the key fact about grains, leading to a low score for correctness and evidence coverage."
