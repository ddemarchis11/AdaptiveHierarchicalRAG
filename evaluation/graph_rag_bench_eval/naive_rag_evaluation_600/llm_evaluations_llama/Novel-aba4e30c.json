    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that Heywood was called 'Maurice' by Rudolph, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it diverges in describing Heywood's treatment of Rudolph, emphasizing concern and camaraderie rather than scoffing, which is explicitly stated in the Gold Answer and supported by the context. While the Model Answer partially aligns with the retrieved context, it introduces unsupported interpretations of Heywood's behavior, reducing faithfulness and evidence coverage."
