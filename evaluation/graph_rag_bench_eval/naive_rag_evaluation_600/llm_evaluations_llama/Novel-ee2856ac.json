  "llm_answer": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, the consumption of alcohol has several negative impacts on the brain's ability to function. Specifically, it states that:\n\n1. Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they cannot carry their messages correctly.\n2. This deadening of the nerves prevents the brain from receiving clear messages, which in turn prevents clear thinking.\n3. As a result, the brain cannot think well, and the person becomes unable to make rational decisions or perform tasks effectively.\n4. The brain is poisoned by alcohol, which can lead to long-term damage and impairment of its functioning.\n5. The consumption of alcohol can also lead to a false feeling of strength, as the nerves are put to sleep and the person is unable to feel the full extent of their physical limitations.\n6. However, this false feeling of strength is temporary and is followed by a period of weakness and fatigue, as the body is unable to function properly due to the presence of alcohol.\n\nOverall, the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER suggests that the consumption of alcohol has a profoundly negative impact on the brain's ability to function, leading to impaired thinking, decision-making, and physical performance.",
