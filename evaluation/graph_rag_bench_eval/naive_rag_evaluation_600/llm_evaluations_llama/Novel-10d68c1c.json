    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about Rudolph's engagement with different cultures or his travels to China and speaking English. However, it fails to answer the user's question using internal knowledge or external reasoning, which would have been necessary given the lack of relevant context. Thus, the answer is faithful to the context but does not align with the Gold Answer or cover its key facts."
