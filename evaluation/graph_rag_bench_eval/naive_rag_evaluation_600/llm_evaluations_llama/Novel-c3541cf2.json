  "llm_answer": "The narrative reveals the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" and Augustin's role as the Dean. This use of nicknames and alternate identities serves to blur the lines between their personal and social identities, creating a sense of complexity and nuance in their characters.\n\nGeorgiana's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" is particularly significant, as it suggests a desire to conceal or mask her true identity. As a woman who has been involved in the world of horse racing, Georgiana may feel the need to adopt a masculine persona in order to navigate this male-dominated sphere. The nickname \"George Tidd\" allows her to do this, creating a sense of separation between her public and private selves. This is reinforced by her claim that \"George Tidd\" was her \"racing name,\" implying that this is a persona she has adopted specifically for the purposes of racing.\n\nAugustin's role as the Dean is also significant, as it creates a sense of distance and formality between him and the other characters. However, this role is also revealed to be a mask or a persona that Augustin has adopted, rather than a genuine aspect of his personality. This is suggested by Georgiana's comment that \"you've been chaffing me, have you?\" implying that Augustin's role as the Dean is not entirely sincere.\n\nThe use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters has a significant impact on the unfolding of their personal and social identities. It creates a sense of complexity and nuance in their characters, suggesting that they are not fixed or static entities, but rather multifaceted and dynamic individuals. This complexity is also reflected in the relationships between the characters, as they navigate the boundaries between their public and private selves.\n\nFurthermore, the use of nicknames and alternate identities serves to highlight the social and cultural norms that govern the characters' lives. Georgiana's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" is a response to the societal expectations placed upon her as a woman, while Augustin's role as the Dean is a reflection of the social and cultural norms that govern the lives of clergy. By blurring the lines between their personal and social identities, the narrative highlights the tensions and contradictions that exist between these norms and the characters' individual desires and aspirations.\n\nIn terms of character development, the use of nicknames and alternate identities serves to create a sense of depth and richness in the characters. Georgiana's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" reveals a complex and multifaceted personality, while Augustin's role as the Dean suggests a sense of vulnerability and insecurity. This complexity is also reflected in the relationships between the characters, as they navigate the boundaries between their public and private selves.\n\nOverall, the narrative's use of nicknames and alternate identities serves to create a sense of complexity and nuance in the characters, highlighting the tensions and contradictions that exist between their personal and social identities. This complexity is reflected in the relationships between the characters, as they navigate the boundaries between their public and private selves.",
