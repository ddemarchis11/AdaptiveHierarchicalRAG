    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides some relevant details about Miss Trotter's resignation and her selection of Frida Jansen, but it introduces additional information about Frida's engagement to Mr. Calton and her affair with Mr. Bilson, which is not directly relevant to the question. While these details are partially grounded in the context, they are not central to the relationship described in the Gold Answer. The Model Answer misses the concise connection between Miss Trotter's resignation and her selection of Frida Jansen, which is the core of the Gold Answer."
