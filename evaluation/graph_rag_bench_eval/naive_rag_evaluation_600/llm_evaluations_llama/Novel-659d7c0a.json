    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies the huehuetl and teponaztli as the musical instruments used by the Aztecs, but the Model Answer does not mention these instruments explicitly. Instead, it lists other instruments like whistles, drums, bells, flutes, trumpets, rattles, and sonorous metal, which are mentioned in the context but not directly tied to the Aztecs in the retrieved text. While the Model Answer provides additional details, it does not focus on the key instruments highlighted in the Gold Answer, and some claims are not clearly supported by the context."
