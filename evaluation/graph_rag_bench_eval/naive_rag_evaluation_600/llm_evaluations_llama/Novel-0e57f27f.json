This comparison shows that Eily is motivated by a desire to be wealthy and to surpass others in terms of material possessions.\n\n3. Eily's reaction to the doctor's suggestion: When the doctor suggests that Eily's wish might be a curse, Eily responds by saying, \"Sure I'd be richer than the Countess o' Kilmoggen hersilf, let alone the Queen, be the time I'd talked for an hour.\" This statement reinforces the idea that Eily is driven by a desire for wealth and material possessions.\n\n4. Eily's love of talking: Eily's statement that she \"loove[s] to talk\" suggests that she enjoys speaking and communicating with others. However, it also implies that she is willing to use her gift to accumulate wealth, as she mentions that she would be richer than the Countess o' Kilmoggen by the time she had talked for an hour.\n\nOverall, Eily's words and actions suggest that she aspires to be wealthy and to possess material possessions, particularly diamonds and pearls.",
