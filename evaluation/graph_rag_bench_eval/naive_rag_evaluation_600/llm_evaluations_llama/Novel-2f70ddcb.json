    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Capt. William Henry Acker as a captain in the First Minnesota regiment and mentions his prior role as adjutant general of Minnesota, which is supported by the context. However, it omits the key detail that he organized the company for the regiment, which is central to the Gold Answer. While the answer is faithful to the context, it does not fully cover the evidence required by the Gold Answer."
