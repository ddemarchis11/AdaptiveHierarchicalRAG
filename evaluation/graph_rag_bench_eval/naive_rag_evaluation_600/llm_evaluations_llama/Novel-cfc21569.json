    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question about Raegen's desired hiding places and reasons for considering them safe. It incorrectly states that there is no information about Raegen in the context, despite the Gold Answer providing specific details. The retrieved context does not contain relevant information about Raegen, but the Model Answer does not utilize internal knowledge to provide a correct response either."
