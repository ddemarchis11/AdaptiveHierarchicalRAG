  "llm_answer": "Papineau's actions during the period leading up to and following the Ninety-Two Resolutions had a significant impact on his relationship with John Neilson. Initially, Neilson was a strong supporter of Papineau and the Patriote cause. However, as Papineau's behavior became more violent and domineering in the Assembly, Neilson began to oppose him.\n\nNeilson's opposition to the Ninety-Two Resolutions was a key factor in the deterioration of his relationship with Papineau. The Resolutions were a radical document that called for the abolition of the Legislative Council and the establishment of an elective council. Neilson, who had previously supported Papineau, opposed the Resolutions, which he saw as too extreme.\n\nPapineau's reaction to Neilson's opposition was to expel Mondelet from the House, which further alienated Neilson. Neilson also opposed the resolutions of Louis Bourdages, Papineau's chief lieutenant, for the abolition of the Legislative Council. In the debate on Quesnel's bill for the independence of judges, Neilson administered a severe rebuke to Papineau for language he had used.\n\nAs a result of these disagreements, Neilson eventually broke with Papineau. He was joined by other prominent members of the Patriote party, including Augustin Cuvillier, F. A. Quesnel, and Andrew Stuart. These individuals, who had previously supported Papineau, now opposed him and his radical policies.\n\nNeilson's break with Papineau was a significant blow to the Patriote leader, as it weakened his position within the party. However, Papineau still maintained a large and powerful following, particularly among the younger members of the Assembly.\n\nNeilson's alignment with Cuvillier and the other seceders was a significant development in the lead-up to the Rebellion of 1837. While Neilson and Cuvillier continued to support the demand for the redress of grievances, they refused to follow Papineau's extreme course. This division within the Patriote party ultimately contributed to the failure of the Rebellion and the suspension of the constitution in Lower Canada.",
