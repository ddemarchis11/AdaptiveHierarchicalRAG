  "question": "What is the historical significance of Chaacmol in Maya history as described in the narrative, considering his funeral chamber at Chichen, the research conducted by Augustus Le Plongeon, and the circumstances of his death at the hands of Aac?",
  "gold_answer": "Chaacmol had a funeral chamber at Chichen, was studied by Augustus Le Plongeon, and was killed by Aac.",
  "llm_answer": "Chacmol is presented as a pivotal, semi-legendary Maya ruler whose life, violent death, and elaborate burial crystallise the political and religious ideology of Chichén-Itzá.\n\n- **Royal identity**: His name literally means “spotted leopard/tiger,” and every sculptural reference shows him wearing or accompanied by that totem; he reigned jointly with his sister-wife Moo, a dynastic arrangement that the texts treat as normative for the younger brother.\n\n- **Circumstances of death**: He was assassinated by his elder brother Aac, who struck him three times in the back with a spear. The motive given is Aac’s jealousy—Moo had chosen the younger Chaacmol over him—and the murder is depicted both in the narrative and in the bas-reliefs of the Queen’s chamber.\n\n- **Funeral chamber as historical document**: The triple-roomed mausoleum Le Plongeon excavated under the “palace and museum” platform was covered with frescoes and carved slabs that recount the event. The paintings show the dying ruler, the extraction of his viscera, and the ritual adoption of his children, turning the tomb into a pictorial royal chronicle comparable to Egyptian temple walls.\n\n- **Le Plongeon’s interpretation**: He read the painted and sculpted programme as proof that Maya dynastic myth—Chaacmol, Moo, Aac, the feathered-serpent patron Can—was the prototype for the Egyptian cycle of Osiris, Isis and Typhon, and he cited the leopard-skin regalia, canopic-style urns, and sistrum-like rattles found inside the tomb as evidence of a shared trans-Atlantic culture memory.\n\nThus, within the narrative Chaacmol’s death is the central traumatic event that justified later monuments, legitimised his widow Moo, and provided the ideological charter for the Sun-versus-Serpent factionalism visible throughout Chichén-Itzá; Le Plongeon’s recovery and publication of the funeral chamber made that event the anchor-point for his broader claim of an ancient Maya-Egyptian civilisational link.",
