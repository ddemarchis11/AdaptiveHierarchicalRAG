  "llm_answer": "Piney is Cissy’s protégée and self-proclaimed “bosom friend.”  \nCissy, the banker’s daughter and acknowledged belle, openly patronizes the hotel-keeper’s daughter: she invites Piney to the house, parades her along Main Street, and promises to use her father’s influence to advance Mr. Tibbs. Piney, conscious of her lower social rank, is proud to bask in Cissy’s reflected glory and depends on her friend’s favor for social elevation.",
