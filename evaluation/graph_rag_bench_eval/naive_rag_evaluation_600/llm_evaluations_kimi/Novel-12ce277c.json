  "question": "What materials were used in the construction of the Assyrian harp, specifically catgut and silk, and what does this reveal about the combination of animal and plant fibers in ancient instrument making practices?",
  "gold_answer": "The Assyrian harp was made of catgut and silk, showing the use of both animal and plant fibers in instrument making.",
  "llm_answer": "The Assyrian harp’s strings were made either of silk (a plant-derived fiber) or of catgut (an animal-derived fiber). This shows that Assyrian instrument-makers deliberately combined both animal and plant materials within the same instrument type, selecting fibers with different acoustic and tensile properties to achieve the desired sound.",
