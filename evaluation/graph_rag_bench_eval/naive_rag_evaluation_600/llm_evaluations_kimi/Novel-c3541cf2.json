  "question": "How does the narrative reveal the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters, specifically through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname George Tidd and Augustin's role as the Dean, and what impact does this have on the unfolding of their personal and social identities?",
  "gold_answer": "Georgiana Tidman uses the nickname George Tidd, and Augustin is also known as the Dean, showing the use of alternate identities among the characters.",
  "llm_answer": "The text shows that Georgiana Tidman actively trades on two distinct identities: the racing alias “George Tidd” (complete with colours, a public record at Newmarket, and the masculine nickname “George”) and her family identity as the Dean’s widowed sister, Mrs. Georgiana Tidman.  When Sir Tristram arrives he immediately recognises “Mr. Tidd,” while the Dean introduces her as “my sister, Georgiana.”  The collision of these two names in the same drawing-room forces both personae into the open and makes it impossible for either the household or the visitor to keep them separate.  Thus the narrative uses the nickname “George Tidd” as the device that exposes the gap between Georgiana’s respectable family role and her sporting past; once the alias is spoken aloud, her social identity becomes fluid, comic, and—because she still owns half of Dandy Dick—financially potent.\n\nAugustin’s identity is fixed by the title everybody uses for him: “the Dean.”  Within the walls of the Deanery that single word carries ecclesiastical authority, yet the moment Georgiana’s racing world intrudes, the title becomes a social mask that can be borrowed or teased: Georgiana jokes that in this house she is “a Dean, too,” and Sir Tristram reminds him that “you’re a Dean” as the reason for refusing hospitality.  The honorific therefore functions both as Augustin’s public self and as a conversational prop that others can manipulate to expose his vulnerability—especially when his sister secretly diverts the Dean’s money toward a bet on “Dandy Dick.”\n\nThe interplay of these nicknames and titles drives the plot: Georgiana’s ability to slip between “George Tidd” and “Mrs. Tidman” lets her move capital and information across the boundaries of turf and clergy, while Augustin’s unshakable label of “Dean” traps him into preserving appearances even as he is drawn into the wager.  The result is that personal identity in the story is never stable; it is continually performed or concealed through the names characters answer to, and the comedy arises from watching the Dean’s solemn household forced to accommodate the irrepressible “Mr. Tidd.”",
