    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies 'HYGIENE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE' as the book containing a dedicated section on TOBACCO, whereas the Gold Answer and Retrieved Context clearly indicate that TOBACCO is part of 'CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER.' The Model Answer is not faithful to the context and fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
