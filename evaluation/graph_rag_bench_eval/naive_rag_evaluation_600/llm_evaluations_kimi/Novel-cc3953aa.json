  "question": "How does Mr. Darbey's status as an officer of the Hussars relate to his being seen by The Dean and spoken to by Sheba?",
  "gold_answer": "The Dean sees Darbey, Mr. Darbey is an officer of the Hussars, Sheba speaks to Mr. Darbey.",
  "llm_answer": "Mr. Darbey’s status as an officer of the Hussars is the only reason the Dean is willing to receive him at all; when the Dean mistakes his name he still greets him courteously because he is “Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey … of the Hussars,” and Sheba, having announced the visitors in those terms, promptly corrects the Dean’s slip of the tongue—“Mr. Darbey!”—thus acknowledging his commission before conversation can proceed.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed interpretation of Mr. Darbey's status as an officer of the Hussars and its relevance to the Dean's reception of him. However, it introduces claims about the Dean's willingness to receive Mr. Darbey solely due to his status, which is not explicitly supported by the retrieved context. The Gold Answer is simpler and focuses on the factual sequence of events (the Dean sees Darbey, Darbey is an officer, Sheba speaks to him), which the Model Answer partially addresses but does not fully align with. Additionally, the Model Answer misses some direct factual points from the Gold Answer, such as Sheba speaking to Mr. Darbey, and includes unsupported interpretations, reducing its faithfulness and evidence coverage."
