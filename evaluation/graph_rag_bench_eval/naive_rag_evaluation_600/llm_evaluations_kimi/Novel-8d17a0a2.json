  "question": "In the apple jelly manufacturing process described in the narrative, how are apple seeds separated and collected during the handling of pomace, and what is the role of the troughs in this procedure?",
  "gold_answer": "Apple seeds are saved by troughs and drop to the bottom of the troughs.",
  "llm_answer": "After the pomace is removed from the press, it is ground again and dropped into a series of long troughs through which water is flowing. As the pulp drifts downstream, it is raked back upstream; the disengaged apple seeds sink to the bottom into still water while the pulp floats on. This succession of troughs removes nearly all the seeds, which are then collected from the bottom.",
