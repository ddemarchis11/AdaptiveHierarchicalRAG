  "question": "Drawing from Augustus Le Plongeon's analysis in 'Vestiges of the Mayas,' what evidence is presented for connections between the Mayas and the Egyptians, and what relationships or comparisons are described between the Mayas and the civilizations of the Asiatic peninsulas?",
  "gold_answer": "The Mayas had many customs and attainments identical to those of the Egyptians, were compared to the Egyptians, and had relations with Asiatic peninsulas.",
  "llm_answer": "Augustus Le Plongeon’s text offers two distinct lines of comparison:\n\n1. Egypt  \n- He lists specific shared customs and attainments between the Mayas and the Egyptians (though he does not detail them in the excerpt).  \n- He notes that Egyptian religion points westward to its ancestral homeland and venerates divinities whose remains are still in “Mayab,” implying an American origin for at least some Egyptian gods.  \n- The hieroglyphic Egyptian sign for “lord” or “master” is a sieve; the very name “Mayab” is said to mean “sieve” in the Maya tongue, and the usual hieroglyph for Egypt itself combines the sieve sign with the land sign—taken by Le Plongeon as evidence that the ruling class of Egypt came from Mayab.  \n- Monumental chronology is invoked: the 36 katun-columns at Ake (each katun = 160 years) give a native record of 5 760 years before the Spanish conquest, far exceeding the age of the oldest Egyptian monuments (c. 2 500 B.C.). Thus, he argues, Maya civilization is older and could have been the donor, not the recipient.\n\n2. Asiatic peninsulas (India, etc.)  \n- Sculptured faces at Copán show an “Asiatic type,” while Hindu temple statues display unmistakably “American” features—taken as proof that some inter-oceanic contact occurred.  \n- Religious lore and customs held in common are, however, “too few” to claim that the Mayas received their civilization from Asia; the likenesses only indicate that “relations had existed” and that beliefs and habits were interchanged, much as happens “between the civilized nations of our days.”",
