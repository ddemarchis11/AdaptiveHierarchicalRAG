  "question": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, how does the consumption of alcohol impact the brain's ability to function, specifically in terms of poisoning the mind, preventing clear thinking, and interfering with the nerves that carry the brain's messages?",
  "gold_answer": "Alcohol poisons the mind and prevents the brain from thinking well by affecting the nerves through which the brain sends messages.",
  "llm_answer": "The CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER states that alcohol “deadens the nerves” so they cannot carry messages correctly, which means “the brain cannot think well.” It further explains that alcohol is “a poison to hurt, and at last to kill,” injuring brain and nerves so they “cannot work well, and send their messages properly,” thus poisoning the mind and preventing clear thinking.",
