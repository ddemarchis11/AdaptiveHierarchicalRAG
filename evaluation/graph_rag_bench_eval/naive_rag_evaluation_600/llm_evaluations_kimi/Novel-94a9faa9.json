  "question": "Throughout Dragon's Blood, what does the recurring portrayal of Rudolph trembling in the presence of Heywood suggest about the nature of their interpersonal dynamic, and how does this reaction inform the reader about power relations or emotional tension between these two characters in various narrative situations?",
  "gold_answer": "Rudolph’s consistent trembling in Heywood’s presence suggests a persistent power imbalance or sense of intimidation, which frames the subsequent events across all chains.",
  "llm_answer": "Rudolph’s repeated trembling whenever he is near Heywood is the story’s shorthand for a one-sided power balance: Heywood has it, Rudolph does not.  \nEach time Rudolph’s body gives that involuntary shiver the reader is shown, without authorial comment, that he is physically intimidated and emotionally over-matched by the older, more confident man. The tremor is a non-verbal admission that Rudolph never feels safe enough to speak or act freely in Heywood’s presence; it turns their “friendship” into a running interrogation scene in which Rudolph is always the suspect and Heywood the examiner. Because the quiver is reflexive it also signals that the imbalance is not just situational (who has the gun, the plan, the captain’s ear) but built into Rudolph’s perception of Heywood as an inherently superior force. Thus the recurrent image keeps the reader conscious that, whatever the outward adventure, the real tension between them is the quiet, internal struggle of a subordinate trying not to betray himself before someone who already owns the upper hand.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly interprets Rudolph's trembling as indicative of a power imbalance and emotional tension, aligning with the Gold Answer's core meaning. It expands on this by analyzing the dynamic between Rudolph and Heywood, which is relevant and insightful. However, the Retrieved Context does not provide explicit evidence to support the claims made in the Model Answer, making it ungrounded in the provided context. Despite this, the Model Answer covers all key facts from the Gold Answer."
