  "question": "Following the King's decision to appoint my Lord, how do my Lord's subsequent actions—such as taking leave of the King, visiting Whitehall, and preparing for a journey to Algier—reveal his active and multifaceted role within the narrative?",
  "gold_answer": "After being appointed by the King, my Lord is depicted as taking leave, visiting important places, and preparing for travel, revealing his active and multifaceted role.",
  "llm_answer": "The King’s designation of my Lord as ambassador immediately sets him in motion: he “takes leave of the King,” a formal act that shows he is already operating at the highest diplomatic level. From Whitehall he steers the business of the fleet—ordering guns fired in salute, arranging victualling for the Duke’s yacht, giving Pepy personal instructions—so that court, navy and foreign policy all converge in his person. Finally, the projected voyage to Algier to settle affairs and escort the new Queen turns him from courtier into seagoing plenipotentiary, combining ceremonial, administrative and strategic roles in a single figure.",
