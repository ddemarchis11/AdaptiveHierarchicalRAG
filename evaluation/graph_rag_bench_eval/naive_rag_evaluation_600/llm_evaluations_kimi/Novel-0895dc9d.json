    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that Captain Balfour visited Kairwan, Toser, and was under the protection of the Bey, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces additional locations like Nefta, Ghafsa, and others, which are not explicitly confirmed in the Gold Answer or clearly supported by the retrieved context. While the narrative mentions these places, it does not definitively state that Captain Balfour visited all of them. The inclusion of unsupported details reduces faithfulness and evidence coverage."
