  "question": "Describe the reasoning path that links Mayab to the goddess Maia of Greece.",
  "gold_answer": "Mayab is a country of the Mayas, who are said to have originated from Mayab. Atlantis is the birthplace of Maia, a goddess in Greece.",
  "llm_answer": "The path runs in three short steps:\n\n1. The American Maya homeland is literally named Mayab (the “land of the sieve”).  \n2. Egyptian hieroglyphs use the sieve-sign to write “lord/master,” so the text infers that people from Mayab once ruled the Nile and were remembered as divine ancestors.  \n3. When similar memories reached Greece, the ancestral goddess was called Maia, “mother of the gods,” her name simply the Hellenized form of Maya/Mayab.",
