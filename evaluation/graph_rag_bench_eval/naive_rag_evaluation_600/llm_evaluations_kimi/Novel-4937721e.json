  "question": "What is the significance of the pentatonic scale in different musical traditions, such as its use in Scotch national dances, its adoption in Chinese musical instruments, and its presence in the intervals produced by the Peruvian syrinx?",
  "gold_answer": "The pentatonic scale is used in Scotch national dances, is adopted by Chinese instruments, and is produced by the Peruvian syrinx.",
  "llm_answer": "The pentatonic scale is significant across these traditions because it appears as the sole or primary set of intervals: Scotch national dances derive their most conspicuous characteristics from the exclusive use of pentatonic intervals; certain Chinese instruments are constructed to produce only this five-note series; and the Peruvian syrinx was purposely built so that its pipes could sound no other scale. Thus, in each case the pentatonic scale is not incidental but deliberately adopted as the defining tonal framework.",
