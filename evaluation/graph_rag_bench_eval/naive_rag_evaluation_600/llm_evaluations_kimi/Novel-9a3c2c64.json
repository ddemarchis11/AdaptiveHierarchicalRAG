  "question": "How is the identity of the Dean established within the narrative, considering his role as the father of Sheba, his alternate name as Augustin, his interactions with Darbey, and the information he receives from Sir Tristram?",
  "gold_answer": "The Dean is the father of Sheba, is also known as Augustin, sees Darbey, and is told information by Sir Tristram, establishing his identity and central role.",
  "llm_answer": "The Dean’s identity is fixed by the way every other character refers to him.\n\n- Salome and Sheba call him “Papa,” so the audience knows at once that he is the father of the two girls.  \n- Georgiana addresses him as “Gus” (Augustin), giving his private Christian name.  \n- The servants and villagers invariably speak of him as “the Dean” or “Dr. Jedd, the Dean of St. Marvells,” stating his public office.  \n\nThus, within the play the same man is simultaneously:  \n- “Papa” to his daughters,  \n- “Augustin” to his sister, and  \n- “Dean Jedd” to the rest of the community.  \n\nDarby’s polite “my dear Dean” and Sir Tristram’s “Dean, old boy” simply reinforce the title that has already been made unmistakable.",
