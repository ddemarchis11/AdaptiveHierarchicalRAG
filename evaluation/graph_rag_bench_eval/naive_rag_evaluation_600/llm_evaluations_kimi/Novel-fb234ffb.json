  "question": "In what way was the city of Hamburg involved in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, especially through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'?",
  "gold_answer": "Hamburg was involved through the Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent, which reviewed Tristram Shandy and was edited by Bode.",
  "llm_answer": "Hamburg played a pivotal role in introducing Laurence Sterne to German readers. The *Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent*—edited by J. J. C. Bode—carried the very first German notice of Sterne (19 Jan 1762) and later printed detailed reviews of the Zückert translation of *Tristram Shandy*. These reviews, very possibly written by Bode himself while he was still connected with the paper, corrected Zückert’s errors and prepared the ground for a better version. A dozen years later Bode, now resident in Hamburg, issued his own complete German rendering of *Tristram Shandy* (Hamburg, 1774), which quickly became the standard translation and fixed Sterne’s reputation in Germany. Thus, through Bode’s editorial and translating activity and through the columns of the *Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent*, Hamburg became the chief conduit by which Sterne’s works entered and were assessed in the German-speaking world.",
