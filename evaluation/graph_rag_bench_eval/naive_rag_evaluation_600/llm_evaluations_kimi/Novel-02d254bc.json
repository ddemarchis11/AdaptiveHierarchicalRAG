  "gold_answer": "Aunt Patsy Perkins could talk faster and more than any woman west of the Alleghany Mountains.",
  "llm_answer": "Aunt Patsy is portrayed as a woman whose power rests almost entirely on her tongue.  \nShe “could talk faster and more of it than any woman west of the Alleghany Mountains,” and in Chicago’s upper circles she is treated as “a queen in the drawing-room” whose rapid, confident talk makes the grandest ladies listen for her counsel.  \n\nIn her visit to Mrs. Daymon she sweeps in, mops her face with a fancy kerchief while fanning herself, and at once launches into a torrent of words: she brags that she will “make it hot for old Perkins,” declares “a woman has nothing but her tongue, and while I live I will use mine,” and fires off vivid figures—comparing two white beans on a fence rail to the difference between Perkins’s hatred of style and her hatred of his “dratted poor kin.”  The speech is fast, emphatic, peppered with back-country metaphors and comic oaths, all delivered “pointing her index finger at Roxie” for emphasis.  In short, her conversational style is rapid, flamboyant, domineering, and laced with down-home imagery that advertises her determination to talk her way over anyone who crosses her.",
