    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies the primary home as 'the house,' which contradicts the Gold Answer ('Cottage') and is not supported by the Retrieved Context. The context does not provide evidence for 'the house' being the primary home, nor does it confirm 'Cottage,' leaving the Model Answer ungrounded and incorrect."
