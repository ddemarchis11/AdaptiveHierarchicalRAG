    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that slate quarries are found in Washington County, New York, whereas the Gold Answer specifies sandstone quarries. The retrieved context does not support the claim about slate quarries in Washington County, making the answer both incorrect and unfaithful to the context. Additionally, the Model Answer fails to cover the key fact about sandstone quarries mentioned in the Gold Answer."
