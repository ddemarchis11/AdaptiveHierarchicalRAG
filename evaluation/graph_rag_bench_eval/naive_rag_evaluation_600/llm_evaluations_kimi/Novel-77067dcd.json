  "question": "Which evidence establishes the connection between the harp in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript and the cymbals used by Egyptians?",
  "gold_answer": "The harp is in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript, which is in the British Museum, which has cymbals that were used by Egyptians.",
  "llm_answer": "There is no evidence in the provided text that establishes a connection between the harp in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript and the cymbals used by Egyptians.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 1.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide evidence connecting the harp in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript to the cymbals used by Egyptians. This aligns with the Gold Answer, which implies a connection but does not provide explicit evidence. The Model Answer is faithful to the context and accurately reflects the lack of supporting information."
