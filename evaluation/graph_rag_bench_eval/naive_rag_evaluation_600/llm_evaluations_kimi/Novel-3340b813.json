  "question": "How does the novel describe the commercial activities of Fez, including its trade with other parts of Morocco and its role as a departure point for caravans to Timbuctoo, within the broader African context?",
  "gold_answer": "Fez has trade with Morocco and sends caravans to Timbuctoo.",
  "llm_answer": "The text portrays Fez as a major commercial hub whose trade “gives it almost the air of an European city.”  \nIts great square, Al-Kaisseriah, is said to display “all the commerce of Europe and Africa—nay, even of the whole world,” with a daily crowd “as at a fair.”  \nFez sends out two annual caravans: one to Central Africa (Timbuctoo) and one to Mecca.  \nThe Timbuctoo caravan travels via the southern staging-points of Tafilett and Touat and is described as taking “about ninety days,” while the Mecca caravan follows the same route as far as Touat before turning north-east through Ghadames, Fezzan and Angelah to Alexandria.",
