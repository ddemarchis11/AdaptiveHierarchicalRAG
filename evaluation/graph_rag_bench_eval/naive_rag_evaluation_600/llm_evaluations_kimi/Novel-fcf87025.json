  "question": "Throughout the narrative of 'Pen Pictures,' what relationships does Roxie have with key political figures such as Governor Morock, as well as family or mentor figures like Ben Robertson and Aunt Patsy Perkins? Please detail Roxie's consultation with Gov. Morock regarding her legal and financial affairs, Gov. Morock's promise to 'pick up the crumbs' for her, how Roxie was taught penmanship by Ben Robertson during her schooling, and her interactions and thoughts involving Aunt Patsy Perkins.",
  "gold_answer": "Roxie consulted Gov. Morock, Gov. Morock was to pick up the crumbs for Roxie, she was taught the art of penmanship by Ben Robertson, was visited by Aunt Patsy Perkins, and thought of Aunt Patsy.",
  "llm_answer": "Roxie’s ties to each of the three figures are quite specific and limited to the moments shown in the text.\n\n1. Governor Morock  \n   - She consults him only after she has been told “everything is positively lost … you are left hopelessly destitute.”  \n   - Morock’s advice is that, since every court-case has gone against her, the only remaining “loop-hole” is for her to let him manufacture a false “shadow” marriage that will “marry her off” and give her a new claim.  \n   - When she refuses that scheme he switches to a second offer: he will “pick up the crumbs” by using Federal-army contacts to seize two-or-three-hundred bales of cotton (worth ~$400 each) from the Simon plantations.  \n   - He names his price: “I’ll pick up the crumbs for half,” meaning a fifty-fifty split. Roxie answers, “Do the best you can,” and leaves. That single interview is the whole of their recorded relationship.\n\n2. Ben Robertson  \n   - No present-time contact occurs. Roxie merely pauses before beginning her letter and, in silent gratitude, “thank(s) from the bottom of her heart old Ben Robertson, who in the country school had taught her the art of penmanship.” He is remembered only as her early writing teacher, nothing more.\n\n3. Aunt Patsy Perkins  \n   - Aunt Patsy is a social caller at the Daymon palace, not a relative of Roxie’s.  \n   - Their talk is one-way: Aunt Patsy airs her grievances about her husband’s “dratted poor kin” and vows to “make it hot for old Perkins,” while Roxie offers almost no comment except to remind Aunt Patsy that young Jim is “kinsfolk on your side of the house.”  \n   - After the visit Roxie “thought no more of her,” and the narrative explicitly states that Roxie died “as ignorant of the fate of her sister as the stone that now stands upon her grave.” Thus Aunt Patsy is merely a passing acquaintance, not a continuing mentor or family figure to Roxie.",
