    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies S. S. Simon as the character Brindle Bill expressed disbelief toward, whereas the Gold Answer states it was Rose. The retrieved context does not support the claim that Brindle Bill expressed disbelief toward S. S. Simon, making the answer unfaithful and missing the key fact from the Gold Answer."
