  "question": "What is the significance of the mustang in the interactions between Grey and Cota at the Ramierez fonda, considering that Grey threw himself across the mustang and Cota cared only for the horse?",
  "gold_answer": "Grey threw himself across the mustang, and Cota cared only for the horse.",
  "llm_answer": "The mustang is the real focus of every encounter between Grey and Cota.  \nCota’s whole life is centered on the horse—“she cared only for the horse. From morning to night!”—so the animal is the one thing she values and the one medium through which she will deal with people. When she offers Grey the ride she is not flirting in the usual sense; she is testing whether the stranger is “strong” and skilful enough to master what she herself has already half-tamed. Grey’s leap across the mustang’s back and his deliberate use of the spurs prove that mastery, and the moment the horse yields Cota’s attitude changes from mockery to recognition: “you are strong—and you comprehend!” The mustang thus acts as the single, indispensable intermediary: every word, glance, or gesture exchanged between the girl and the editor is really a comment on the horse, and the outcome of Grey’s ride decides whether Cota will treat him as another contemptible visitor or as an equal who has passed her test.",
