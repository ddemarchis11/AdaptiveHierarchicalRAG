    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Tregeagle's dwelling was in Cornwall, which is a broader location. The Model Answer specifies Dozmare Pool as his dwelling, which is mentioned in the context but does not align with the Gold Answer's general statement. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it fails to match the Gold Answer and misses the broader factual point."
