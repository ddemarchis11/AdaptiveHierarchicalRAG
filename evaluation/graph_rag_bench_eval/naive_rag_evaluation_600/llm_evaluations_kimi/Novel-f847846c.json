  "question": "Imagine you are Young Simon. Write a diary entry about your family connections and your feelings about the events involving your cousin Cæsar and Roxie.",
  "gold_answer": "As the only son of S. S. Simon, I often hear stories about our family. My cousin, Cæsar, has been at the center of recent events, from delivering a note to the Governor to helping Simon learn about Roxie's family. I hear Roxie has been charged, and I worry for her. Our family feels so interconnected, especially with big-sis raising Cæsar and our ties to the Carlow and Brindle families.",
  "llm_answer": "April 6, 1861 – Chicago, Palmer House Hotel  \n\nNight, past eleven.  The gas-jets hiss like the river-boats I have known since boyhood, and I cannot sleep for the weight of blood that is upon me.  I write because the doctor says I may not have many nights left to set down the truth, and because I would have one page that is mine, not the lawyers’ or the newspapers’.  \n\nI am Young Simon only in name; in flesh I am the last twig of a tree whose roots are twisted round the bones of slaves.  My father, S. S. Simon, died cursing the name of Roxie Daymon, a woman I have never met yet whose shadow has darkened every doorway of my life.  I thought to break that shadow by finding her, by giving her—what?  A silver dollar?  A fortune?  A conscience?  I do not know.  I only knew that until I looked her in the eye I should never be free of the sound of my father’s dying breath: “Get Roxie Daymon away.”  \n\nSo I went down the river with cousin Cæsar, who is more brother than kin.  He is the son of my father’s brother, but he was raised by two washer-women who called him “child” and kept him alive on bread and butter when the world gave them nothing.  Cæsar has the gift of seeing the bottom of things; I have only the gift of spending.  Together we made a strange pair—he with his wits sharpened on hardship, I with my health blunted by ease.  Yet he loves me, and I love him with the desperate cling a drowning man gives to the only plank afloat.  \n\nOn the Roman Eagle I found her—Roxie Fairfield, alias Daymon.  She sat beside me in the dusk, proud and honest, calling herself “poor trash,” never knowing that her blood, like mine, was tangled in a will that could buy cities.  I asked her of aunts named Rose and Suza, and when she answered I felt the click of destiny like the cocking of a pistol.  I wanted to tell her everything—of the twenty thousand dollars, of the twenty years’ interest, of the estate that waits like a coiled snake in Arkansas—but the Angel of Caution touched my lip and I held my peace.  I left her thinking me only a curious traveller.  I left her, and I asked her to marry me in the spring.  \n\nWe came back to Chicago three weeks ago.  The city was loud with talk of war; my body was already marching to its own drumbeat of fever.  I knew I should not stand long upon my feet, yet I clung to the hope that I might reach the altar and give her, in one clean gesture, both my name and my contrition.  Yesterday I could not rise.  To-day I could not lift the pen without shaking.  Cæsar sat by me through the dark, his hand on mine, counting my pulse as though he could hold my soul inside its cage of bones.  \n\nRoxie was here this afternoon.  She moved about the room like a candle-flame, lighting every corner with her quiet courage.  When Cæsar stepped out she pressed a sealed note into his hand for Governor Morock.  I guessed her purpose: she would have the lawyer draw the will that would make her my heir.  I did not protest.  What is mine is hers—land, slaves, dollars, disgrace—all of it.  I dictated the words: “I give and bequeath unto Roxie Daymon, my affianced wife, every acre, every dollar, every claim I possess.”  The Governor asked ten dollars for his trouble; she paid it without flinching.  I think she would have paid with her life’s blood if the law required.  \n\nI do not know whether she loves me or the fortune.  The Angel of Observation, who has chronicled every sin of the Simon line, has closed his book and will not say.  Yet I have seen her eyes when she smooths the counterpane over my wasted chest—there is tenderness there, and something else: the steady resolve of one who has been poor and will not be so again.  I cannot blame her.  We are both heirs to a theft older than ourselves; if she takes the spoils, she also takes the curse.  Let it be so.  Better her hand than the lawyers’ or the State’s.  \n\nCæsar will carry my body southward when I am gone.  He will lay me beside the father whose name I never learned to honor.  I have left him nothing but my watch and my gratitude.  It is enough; he has the land of memory, which is more fertile than any cotton field.  \n\nI hear the clock strike twelve.  My breath comes short, yet my heart is strangely quiet.  If Roxie’s fortune is made, then let her build a life free of the Simon shadow.  If Cæsar survives the war that now gathers like thunder on every horizon, let him tell her that I loved her—not for her beauty alone, but because she bore the name my father feared, and in bearing it bore also my only chance at absolution.  \n\nI sign myself, for the last time,  \n\nSimon — once of Arkansas, once of the river, once of hope.",
