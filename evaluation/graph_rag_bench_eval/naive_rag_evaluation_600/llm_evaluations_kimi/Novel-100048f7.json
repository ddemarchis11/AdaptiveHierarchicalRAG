  "question": "How is the character of Augustin involved in the sequence between Sir Tristram and The Dean’s family?",
  "gold_answer": "Sir Tristram pulled the horse's nose-bag over The Dean, Augustin is also known as The Dean, The Dean is father of Sheba.",
  "llm_answer": "Augustin is the Dean of St. Marvells—i.e. “the Dean” himself—so every reference to “the Dean” is a reference to him.  \nIn the stretch of play that concerns Sir Tristram and the Dean’s household, Augustin is therefore:\n\n- the absent father whose unexplained disappearance the night before has upset the household;  \n- the owner (through Georgiana’s secret arrangement) of half of the race-horse Dandy Dick, the very horse Sir Tristram has come to run at the Durnstone meeting;  \n- the person whose supposed “suicide” is momentarily theorised by Noah;  \n- the clergyman whose dignity and authority are being undermined by the racing activities of his sister Georgiana and his daughters Sheba and Salome;  \n- the prospective brother-in-law of Sir Tristram, who is engaged to Georgiana.\n\nThus Augustin/“the Dean” is the pivotal figure whose domestic authority and personal reputation are at stake in the comic conflict between Sir Tristram and the rest of the family.",
