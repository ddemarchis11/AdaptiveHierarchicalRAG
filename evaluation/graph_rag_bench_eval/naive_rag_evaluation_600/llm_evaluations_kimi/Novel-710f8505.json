Her presence there, openly acknowledged as the King’s mistress, signals that he did not separate his amorous life from his cultural pursuits: the playhouse was a place where both could be displayed, blending royal patronage of the arts with the conspicuous enjoyment of a relationship that transcended official court duty.",
