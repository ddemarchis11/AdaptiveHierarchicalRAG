  "question": "During their encounter after the battle, did Cousin Cæsar recognize his old acquaintance Steve Brindle, and what was the outcome of their meeting?",
  "gold_answer": "No, Cousin Cæsar did not recognize Steve Brindle.",
  "llm_answer": "Yes. While the remnants of Price’s command were pinned down, Cousin Cæsar spotted a Federal soldier in the distance and “recognized Steve Brindle.” That recognition was the whole of their meeting: Cæsar remained where he was and shortly afterward was killed in the retreat, so the two old comrades never actually spoke or came together again.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Cousin Cæsar recognized Steve Brindle during their encounter after the battle, which contradicts the Gold Answer and the Retrieved Context. The context explicitly mentions that Cousin Cæsar did not recognize Steve Brindle, despite their past relationship. While the Model Answer provides additional details about the situation, it misrepresents the key fact of recognition, leading to partial correctness and faithfulness. Evidence coverage is also partial, as the core fact from the Gold Answer is missed."
