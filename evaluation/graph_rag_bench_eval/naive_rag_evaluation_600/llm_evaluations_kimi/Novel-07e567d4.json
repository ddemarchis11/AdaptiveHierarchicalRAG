    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Raegen wished to hide in any tenement on Cherry Street, which is not supported by the Gold Answer or the Retrieved Context. The Gold Answer specifies that Raegen wanted to hide in the cellar and the garret, and this detail is not mentioned or supported by the context provided.
