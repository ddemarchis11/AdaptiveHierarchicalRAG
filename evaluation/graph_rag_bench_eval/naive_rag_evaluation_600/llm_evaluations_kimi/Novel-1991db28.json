  "question": "In the historical context of the Assembly of Lower Canada, which key figures or groups specifically opposed the passage of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, as reflected by their votes or public statements, and what actions did the resolutions themselves call for regarding the impeachment of Lord Aylmer?",
  "gold_answer": "The Ninety-Two Resolutions were opposed by Quesnel and John Neilson; Augustin Cuvillier and F. A. Quesnel voted against them; and the resolutions demanded the impeachment of Lord Aylmer.",
  "llm_answer": "Key figures who publicly opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions were the Assembly members who broke with Papineau—Neilson, Cuvillier, Quesnel, Stuart and “two or three others.”  All of them were defeated at the general election that followed, showing that their opposition was recorded in debate and at the polls.\n\nThe Resolutions themselves went beyond demanding Lord Aylmer’s removal: they explicitly called for his impeachment.",
