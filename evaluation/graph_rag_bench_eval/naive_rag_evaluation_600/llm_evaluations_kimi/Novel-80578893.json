  "llm_answer": "Dr. Elsie Inglis served on the first committee of the Women’s Liberal League and later became Honorary Secretary of the Scottish Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies. In the League she helped shape its Imperialist and social-legislation campaigns; as Federation Secretary she co-ordinated the scattered Scottish societies into a single, disciplined machine that could exert steady parliamentary pressure. These posts allowed her to turn constitutional suffragism from scattered meetings into an organised national force, keeping the movement law-abiding yet effective and ensuring that the demand for women’s citizenship remained a central political issue in Scotland.",
