  "question": "How was the city of Mogador affected by both the French and the Berbers, according to the novel's account of its bombardment and subsequent destruction?",
  "gold_answer": "Mogador was bombarded by the French and was left in ruins by the Berbers.",
  "llm_answer": "The French bombarded Mogador from the sea, silencing its defenses and driving out the Moorish authorities. Once the governor and troops fled, Berber and Arab tribes rushed in, sacking the city from within—plundering houses, murdering and stripping inhabitants, especially targeting the Jewish quarter. Thus, while the French attack shattered the city’s military and administrative structure, the subsequent Berber-led pillage completed its ruin, leaving Mogador a looted, burning wreck.",
