  "question": "How do my Lord's actions of expressing gratitude to Sir R. Slingsby and issuing orders to Mr. Creed demonstrate his leadership qualities and the way he exercises both appreciation and authority in his role?",
  "gold_answer": "By thanking Sir R. Slingsby and ordering Mr. Creed, my Lord demonstrates both appreciation and authority, underlining his leadership style.",
  "llm_answer": "My Lord’s behaviour shows two complementary sides of leadership.  \n1. Appreciation: he makes a point of publicly thanking Sir R. Slingsby for “his kindness to me,” letting others (including Pepys) hear it. This open acknowledgement rewards loyalty, strengthens alliances and signals that good service is noticed.  \n2. Authority: within the same sequence he briskly “orders Mr. Creed to imprest” £300 on Pepys, turning a favour into an immediate, concrete instruction. The order is given in Pepys’s presence and is acted on at once, demonstrating that his word is final and that resources are deployed simply because he wills it.  \n\nThus, in a single episode he balances warmth—public gratitude—with decisive command, reinforcing both personal bonds and the chain of command.",
