  "question": "Why are Cole Conway and Steve Sharp considered important figures in the novel's narrative, and what roles did they play together, particularly regarding their professions and activities such as playing cards?",
  "gold_answer": "Cole Conway was an engineer who was in company with Steve Sharp, a pilot, and they played cards together.",
  "llm_answer": "Cole Conway (alias Cousin Cæsar) and Steve Sharp (alias Steve Brindle) are important because the story follows their linked lives as young confidence-men.  Professionally they styled themselves “partners in the game,” i.e., card-sharpers who worked together in the back rooms of saloons, fleecing whoever would sit down to play with them.  Their joint activity—playing cards—thus drives the plot: it is while they are losing every cent they have to a still-slicker gambler that Conway has the vivid dream that opens the narrative and that leads the pair to trade true names and histories, anchoring the rest of the novel.",
