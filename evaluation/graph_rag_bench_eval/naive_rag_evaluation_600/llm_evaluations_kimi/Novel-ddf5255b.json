  "question": "How did Papineau's actions during the period leading up to and following the Ninety-Two Resolutions affect his relationship with John Neilson, including Neilson's opposition to the resolutions, his eventual break with Papineau, and his alignment with Augustin Cuvillier?",
  "gold_answer": "Papineau's actions alienated John Neilson, who opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions and broke with Papineau, following the lead of Augustin Cuvillier.",
  "llm_answer": "Papineau’s increasingly radical course—especially his push for the Ninety-Two Resolutions—drove a wedge between him and John Neilson. Neilson openly opposed the resolutions in debate, rejected their tone and content, and voted against them; Papineau responded with public rebukes. This clash crystallised the rift: Neilson, joined by his close ally Augustin Cuvillier (and others such as Andrew Stuart and Quesnel), broke definitively with Papineau, left the Patriote camp, and was thereafter counted among the “Chouayen” minority.",
