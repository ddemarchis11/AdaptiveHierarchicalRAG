    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Angeline Hall pleaded to her mother, which is not supported by the context or the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer specifies that Angeline pleaded with Asaph Hall during a difficult period, and this is not reflected in the Model Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide evidence for the claim made in the Model Answer."
