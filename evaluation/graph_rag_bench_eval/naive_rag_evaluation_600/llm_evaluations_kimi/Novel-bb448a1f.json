  "question": "In the scene where an ill-looking man enters Toto's cottage and searches the kitchen, what objects did the man open while looking for valuables?",
  "gold_answer": "Boxes",

    "answer_correctness": 0.5,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer mentions the drawer containing the six silver teaspoons and the porringer, which is supported by the context. However, the Gold Answer specifies 'boxes,' which the Model Answer does not include. While the Model Answer is partially correct, it misses the broader mention of 'boxes' as objects opened by the man, reducing evidence coverage and correctness."
