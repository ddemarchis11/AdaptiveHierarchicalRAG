    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides some relevant details about Ruth's connection to Angeline Stickney during their educational journey, such as Ruth's enrollment at McGrawville and her support for Angeline. However, it misses the specific emotional connection highlighted in the Gold Answer, where Ruth wished to be with Angeline. Additionally, while some claims in the Model Answer are supported by the context, others (e.g., Ruth taking Angeline home when she collapsed) are not explicitly grounded in the retrieved context. The evidence coverage is partial, as the Model Answer does not fully capture the core facts of the Gold Answer."
