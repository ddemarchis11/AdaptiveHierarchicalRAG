  "gold_answer": "Blocks made of refractory clay contain the retorts, and slabs cover the compartment in the baking chamber.",

  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the use of refractory clay blocks and refractory tiles in the containment and coverage of the retorts, which aligns with the context. However, it misses the specific mention of slabs covering the compartment in the baking chamber, as stated in the Gold Answer. While the details provided are accurate and grounded in the context, the omission of the slabs reduces evidence coverage and completeness."
