  "gold_answer": "Cousin Cæsar was in close counsel with Cliff Carlo, served under Gen. Price, and was left alone by Steve Brindle.",
  "llm_answer": "Cousin Cæsar’s life is shown as a tangle of battlefield duty, family obligation, and a friendship that finally deserts him.\n\n1. Legal counsel with Cliff Carlo  \n   While the war is already under way, Cæsar slips back to Kentucky and meets Cliff Carlo “in close counsel on the southern bank of the beautiful Ohio.”  Their talk is not about troop movements but about the lawsuit over the Arkansas Simon estate.  Cliff, the cautious oldest son of the family, is “rather non-committal,” unwilling to commit the Carlo fortune to finance the case; Cæsar, true to his nature, replies, “I have made the cast, and will stand the hazard of the die.”  The scene shows that, even in the middle of civil war, Cæsar’s first concern is still the family’s legal battle for the inheritance.\n\n2. Service under General Price  \n   Cæsar rejoins the Confederate force and is present in the roll-call made by General Price’s lieutenant.  He is entered on the company roster as “No. 77,” a number that haunts him with superstitious dread.  He marches with Price through the capture of Lexington, the retreat from the Missouri River, and the failed three-pronged attack on Independence Day in which Marmaduke and Fagan do not carry their forts.  During that fight Cæsar sees Steve Brindle—now wearing Federal blue—fighting “for m-o-n-e-y,” and mutters that he himself is fighting for “land stripped of its ornaments.”  When the assault collapses, Price orders retreat; Cæsar is shot and left on the field, “the last link in the chain of the Simon family in the male line.”\n\n3. Abandonment by Steve Brindle  \n   Earlier in the war Brindle had saved Cæsar’s life after Elkhorn, binding up a wound and carrying him to camp.  Yet once Cæsar came into money he “did not know S-t-e-v-e Brindle,” refusing to help the man who had once divided his last cent with him.  On the Independence-Day battlefield their positions are reversed: Brindle, now a Union soldier, is close enough to be recognized but does not come to Cæsar’s aid.  The narrative pointedly says nothing of any rescue; instead, Cæsar falls alone, deserted by the friend whose loyalty he himself had already thrown away.",
