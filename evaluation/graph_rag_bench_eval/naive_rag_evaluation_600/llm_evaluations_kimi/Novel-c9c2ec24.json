  "question": "What is the reasoning path from Heckshill to Mr. Tarbox’s interaction with Brice?",
  "gold_answer": "Heckshill wrote to Mr. Tarbox; Mr. Tarbox didn't answer Brice.",
  "llm_answer": "1. Heckshill’s polite letter after seeing the newspaper paragraph tells Tarbox he didn’t know Tarbox was “a well-known citizen” and asks him to recommend timber land.  \n2. Tarbox, seizing the chance to look respectable, sells Heckshill half of his own quarter-section and begins styling himself a land-agent.  \n3. This new, “respectable” business identity makes Tarbox determined to break all connection with Snapshot Harry’s gang and with anyone (Brice) who might remind people of that past.  \n4. Therefore, when Brice sends letters to Flora by way of Tarbox, Tarbox refuses to deliver them, tells Brice he has “chucked your letter in the fire,” and ends the former friendly dealings—an abrupt change that is the direct scene of interaction between Tarbox and Brice.",
