    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Raegen wants to hide beneath rustling leaves, which is not supported by the Gold Answer or the Retrieved Context. The Gold Answer specifies that Raegen wanted to hide in his own cellar and garret, and the context does not provide any information about rustling leaves or why Raegen considers them safe."
