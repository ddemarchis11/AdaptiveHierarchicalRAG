    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Elsie Maud Inglis wrote to the British Medical Association, whereas the Gold Answer specifies the Registered Medical Women's Association. The retrieved context does not provide evidence to support the Model Answer, nor does it mention the British Medical Association in relation to Elsie Maud Inglis's efforts. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
