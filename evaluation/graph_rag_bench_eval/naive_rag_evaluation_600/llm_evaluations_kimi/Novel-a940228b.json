  "question": "Retell the story of Corinna’s farewell to her parrot as if you are Corinna, writing in her personal diary. Include the role of Isis as invoked in the triplets.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today was a day of sorrow. My beloved parrot, companion and confidant, was snatched away by envious fate, taken from my side. I said my farewells with heavy heart. In my grief, I called upon Isis, hoping she would turn her features to me and grant comfort. The gods are distant, yet my pain feels as if I am born to be a cause of trouble to my lover.",
  "llm_answer": "**Corinna’s Diary**  \n*The Kalends of Junius, the year of Drusus’s second consulship*\n\nI write by lamplight, my hand trembling more than the flame.  \nToday I bade farewell to the one creature who never betrayed my secrets—my parrot, the little green chatterbox who learned to say my name better than any lover. He died at dawn, on the seventh day of his sickness, just as the physicians warned. I laid him on a cushion of Egyptian linen and held the tiny body until it cooled. Even then his beak was parted, as though he meant one last “Corinna—vale!”  \n\nI had prayed to Isis of the seven mouths of the Nile, to Lucina who smooths the brows of women in labour, to Anubis who weighs the tongue of the dead. I walked in procession behind the Galli, my own hair unbound beneath the laurel, and scattered frankincense until the altar smoked white. “Let the bird live,” I begged, “and I will offer a silver sistrum, a wax image of myself in childbirth, and the inscription: *Naso, for Corinna’s preservation, gives these.*”  \n\nBut the Goddess turned her face toward Canopus and would not be moved. Perhaps she remembered that I once mocked her rites, calling them foreign mummery. Or perhaps she knows what I have hidden even from Ovid: that I tried to rid myself of the burden beneath my girdle, the secret swelling that would bind me forever to a poet who loves only what he can rhyme. The same herb that would have freed me from one life cost me the life I cherished more.  \n\nSo the parrot’s soul has flown to the Elysian grove where the Phoenix nests and Juno’s peacocks strut without fear. There he will call “Corinna!” to the innocent swans, and they will answer with the soft voices of children.  \n\nI buried him beneath the rose-bed, in a coffin no bigger than my palm. On the marble I had carved:  \n\n*From this very tomb you may know I was once the favourite of my mistress.  \nI had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.*  \n\nThe letters are already blurred by my tears. If ever I bear a child, I will teach it to speak in a green voice, so that something of him may return.  \n\nIsis, I release my vow. Take instead the weight of my own heart; it is heavier than any wax image.  \n\n*Corinna*",
