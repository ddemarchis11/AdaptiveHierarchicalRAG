    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Constant Woodward was wounded at Bull Run, while the Model Answer incorrectly identifies Jasper Woodward as the wounded individual. The context confirms that both Constant and Jasper Woodward were wounded, but Jasper's wound was not the focus of the question. Thus, the Model Answer is incorrect in identifying the wrong individual, though it is faithful to the retrieved context."
