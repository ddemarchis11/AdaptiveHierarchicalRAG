  "question": "How does the narrative depict the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery, specifically through Blore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver and the process by which Major Tarver is ultimately accepted by Salome?",
  "gold_answer": "Major Tarver is shown being introduced by Blore and ultimately accepted by Salome, illustrating the process by which new individuals are incorporated into the group.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative shows integration as a two-step performance: first, the household’s gatekeeper (Blore) is formally instructed to “show the gentlemen hin,” publicly signalling that the outsiders are granted physical admission; second, the newcomer must pass a private, emotional test administered by the core member whose acceptance confers full membership. Blore’s action is therefore the ritual opening of the door, while Salome’s eventual willingness to walk into the library hand-in-hand with Tarver is the ritual closing that confirms he has been accepted into the Deanery circle.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer accurately captures the process of integration depicted in the narrative, including Blore's role in introducing Major Tarver and Salome's eventual acceptance of him. It provides a detailed explanation of the steps involved, aligning with the Gold Answer and the Retrieved Context. The additional context about the emotional and ritualistic aspects of acceptance is relevant and supported by the narrative details."
