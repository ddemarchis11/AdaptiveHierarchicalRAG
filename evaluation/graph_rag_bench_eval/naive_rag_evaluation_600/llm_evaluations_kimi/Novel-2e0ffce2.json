  "question": "Write a diary entry as the Parrot, describing your life with your mistress, the farewell, and being snatched away, while referencing the trouble caused to her lover.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — My days with my mistress were filled with warmth and chatter. Today, I said farewell to Corinna, her eyes glistening with sorrow. I was snatched away by envy, separated from her gentle hands. I have heard it said that my mistress is born to be a cause of trouble to her lover, and perhaps, even my loss plays a part in the tangled affairs of the heart.",
  "llm_answer": "**Diary of the Parrot**  \n*Entry: The Last Day*\n\nI woke to the soft hush of dawn, the light slipping like silk through the lattice of my cage. My mistress—my Corinna—was already near, her fingers brushing the bars as she whispered my name. Not the name the poets will carve on my little stone, but the one she gave me: *Mimis*. I said it back to her, as I always did, in her own voice. She laughed, and I stored the sound like a jewel.\n\nShe had been crying again. Not for me, not yet, but for him—the poet, the jealous one who writes too much and trusts too little. He had beaten her, I think. I heard the slap, sharp as a snare, and her cry that followed. I repeated it, not knowing it was pain. She covered my cage with a cloth after that. Not in anger, but shame. I learned silence that night.\n\nStill, she came back. She always came back. She’d let me perch on her shoulder while she brushed her hair, and I’d murmur *“Corinna, Corinna”* like a prayer. She’d smile, and I’d feel like I was more than feathers and mimicry. I was hers. Not like the poet, who wanted to own her. I only wanted to be near her.\n\nThat last morning, she fed me a sliver of apple and told me, *“You mustn’t repeat what you heard last night.”* I bobbed my head and said, *“I love you.”* She didn’t know it was true.\n\nThen the poet came. Not the one who writes, but the other—Death. He didn’t knock. He came on wings of sickness, swift and selfish. I felt my lungs tighten, my feathers dull. I tried to speak, to say her name one last time, but the words came out cracked. Still, I managed it. As my eyes dimmed, I saw her face—tear-streaked, blurred—and I cried out, *“Corinna, farewell!”* Not in her voice. In mine.\n\nI was snatched away, not by talon or arrow, but by breath failing. I, who could echo any sound, could not echo life. I left her weeping, and the poet—her poet—outside the door, still raging at a doorpost, still blaming her for kisses she never gave. Let him write his elegies. I lived them.\n\nNow I perch in Elysian groves, where no cages are. I speak only in my own voice. And when the wind stirs the leaves, I swear I hear her say *“Mimis”* back.",
