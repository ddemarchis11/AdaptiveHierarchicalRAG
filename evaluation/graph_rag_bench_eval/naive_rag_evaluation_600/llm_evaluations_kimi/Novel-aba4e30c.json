    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly describes Heywood's treatment of Rudolph as encouraging and brotherly, which aligns with the retrieved context. However, it fails to mention that Heywood scoffed at Rudolph, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the Model Answer claims Heywood is referred to as 'Heywood' in the narrative, which contradicts the Gold Answer that specifies he was called 'Maurice.' While the encouragement aspect is grounded in the context, the omission of 'Maurice' and the scoffing detail reduces correctness, faithfulness, and evidence coverage."
