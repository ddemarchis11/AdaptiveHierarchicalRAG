  "question": "Describe the relationship between Latimer and Ellen in the context of the novel, noting Latimer's feelings for Ellen and her identity as the daughter of the bishop.",
  "gold_answer": "Latimer loves Ellen, who was the daughter of the bishop.",
  "llm_answer": "Latimer is in love with Ellen, the bishop’s daughter, and has come to ask her father for permission to marry her. His feelings are intense and exclusive: he insists that Ellen is “the only woman who has the power to make me happy” and that loving her “is all that there is of any consequence in the world to me.” Ellen, for her part, has recently declared that she loves him, but after overhearing Latimer’s evasive answers to her father’s hypothetical test of his devotion, she withdraws her trust and asks her father to make Latimer leave. Thus, while Latimer’s love for the bishop’s daughter remains fervent, the crisis reveals that Ellen no longer feels secure in that love.",
