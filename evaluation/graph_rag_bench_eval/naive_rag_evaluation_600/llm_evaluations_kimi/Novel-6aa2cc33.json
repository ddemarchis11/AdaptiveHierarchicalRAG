  "question": "How does the narrative chain connect Cornwall's legendary expression to Arthur and his associates, particularly through Arthur's relationship with Sir Bedevere and the pivotal event of Excalibur being thrown away?",
  "gold_answer": "Cornwall is said to find its legendary expression in Arthur, who is connected to Sir Bedivere and pivotal events like the throwing of Excalibur, tying the region's narrative identity to Arthurian legend.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative links Cornwall’s legendary landscape to Arthur by turning every topographical mention into a scene from the story.  \nTintagel is “his birth-place,” Camelford is “where he fought his last battle,” Slaughter Bridge is where “he received his death-wound,” and Dozmare Pool is the mere into which the sword must be returned.  \n\nThat act of returning the sword is the hinge between the living king and the departing legend.  \nArthur’s last living tie to the world is Sir Bedevere, the single knight who remains with him on the shore.  \nBedevere’s reluctant obedience—finally casting Excalibur into Dozmare Pool—triggers the arrival of the barge with the three queens; once the sword is gone, Arthur is carried off “to be healed of his grievous wound.”  \nThus the landscape (Dozmare Pool), the companion (Bedevere), and the sword’s disappearance together seal Arthur’s passage from history into the Cornish legend that the countryside still tells.",
