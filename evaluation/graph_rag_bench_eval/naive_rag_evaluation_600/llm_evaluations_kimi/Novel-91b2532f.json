  "question": "During the period of unrest in Minnesota, what patterns of protest and government response emerged, particularly as Indians protested against traders sitting at the government's pay table and the government was accused of neglecting its wards in Minnesota, eventually leading to the state's call to furnish military regiments such as the Sixth regiment?",
  "gold_answer": "Indians protested against traders sitting at the pay table of the government, while the government neglected its wards in Minnesota, leading to ongoing unrest and calls for military intervention.",
  "llm_answer": "The Indians’ protest began with a specific grievance: they objected to traders being allowed to sit at the government pay-table and take annuities directly from the money owed them. When weeks passed without the promised payments—because the war-drained government claimed it had no gold—the Indians interpreted the delay as deliberate neglect. Their protest escalated from verbal complaints to an armed outbreak. The state’s response was military: Minnesota was ordered to raise five new infantry regiments (the Sixth through Tenth) to suppress the uprising.",
