  "gold_answer": "Toser was visited by Captain Balfour and has Moorish baths.",
  "llm_answer": "Toser is significant in Captain Balfour’s narrative as a key stop during his tour of the Jereed with the “Bey of the Camp.” The city is described in detail: its gardens under date-trees, warm streams where the travelers bathed, and the presence of Moorish baths—described as “a luxury rare on the confines of the Desert.” These baths, along with the city’s mosques, schools, and fondouks (inns), highlight Toser’s relative refinement despite its outwardly dilapidated appearance. The mention of Moorish baths underscores the cultural and infrastructural aspects of Toser that stood out to the travelers, marking it as a notable, if modest, center of comfort and civilization in the region.",
