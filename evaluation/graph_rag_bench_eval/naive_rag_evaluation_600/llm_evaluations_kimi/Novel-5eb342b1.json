    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Quesnel opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions, which is supported by the retrieved context. However, the Model Answer incorrectly identifies Neilson as the opponent, which is not supported by the context and contradicts the Gold Answer. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
