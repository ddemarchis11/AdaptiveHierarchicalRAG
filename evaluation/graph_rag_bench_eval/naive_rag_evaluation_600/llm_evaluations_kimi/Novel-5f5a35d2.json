    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the fiddle-bow is used with the _rotta_, which is not supported by the context or the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer specifies the fiddle as the instrument played with a fiddle-bow, and the context does not provide evidence linking the fiddle-bow to the _rotta_. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
