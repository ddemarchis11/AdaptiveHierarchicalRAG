  "question": "How do the triplets demonstrate the interplay between local rulers—such as the Emperor residing at Mequinez and the Sultan in Salee—and foreign influences, as seen through historical events like England's occupation of Tangier, the French bombardment of Mogador, and the Portuguese destruction of Anfa, thereby highlighting the regions' internal governance and external challenges?",
  "gold_answer": "Local rulers such as the Emperor and Sultan govern regions, but their domains have experienced foreign actions like the English occupation of Tangier, French bombardment of Mogador, and Portuguese destruction of Anfa, showing both internal authority and external challenges.",
  "llm_answer": "The triplets show that Morocco’s own rulers—the Emperor at Mequinez and the Sultan in Salee—were never left to govern in isolation.  \nEvery time a local dynasty tried to fix its capital and impose order, a foreign power stepped in and re-drew the map.\n\n1. Mequinez – Emperor’s seat  \n   While the Emperor collected olive taxes and paraded his court at Mequinez, England quietly took Tangier (1662) and turned the Strait into a British toll-booth. The Emperor could issue edicts inside Morocco, but the gate to the Atlantic was suddenly controlled by another crown.\n\n2. Salee – Sultan’s corsair capital  \n   Salee’s Sultans built fleets that raided Europe, yet when the French squadron bombarded Mogador (1844) the Sultan could only watch the smoke from up the Bou-Regreg; the European consuls he had detained became hostages in a war that was no longer his to start or stop.\n\n3. Anfa (today Casablanca) – ruined Portuguese outpost  \n   The Portuguese destroyed Anfa (1468) and rebuilt it as Casa-Blanca while the inland Sultanate was still quarrelling over succession; the town passed from Portuguese to Moroccan hands and back again, a reminder that coastal “Moroccan” cities were repeatedly redesigned by foreign blue-prints.\n\nThus the triplets—Mequinez, Salee, Anfa—form one continuous story: internal sovereignty proclaimed from palace or mosque, external reality imposed by cannon, treaty, or bombardment.",
