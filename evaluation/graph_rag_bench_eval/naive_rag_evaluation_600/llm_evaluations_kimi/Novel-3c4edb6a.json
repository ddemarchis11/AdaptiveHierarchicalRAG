    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Elsie Maud Inglis as the founder and leader of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals and mentions her leading a unit to Serbia, which aligns with the context. However, it omits the specific connection described in the Gold Answer, namely her sending Miss Burke to America, where Burke influenced her countrymen to aid the S.W.H., which then went to Serbia. Additionally, the claim about Inglis leading the unit herself is not explicitly supported by the retrieved context, making the answer partially faithful and incomplete in evidence coverage."
