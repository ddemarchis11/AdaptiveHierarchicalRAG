    "explanation": "The Model Answer mentions whistles, flutes, drums, and rattles (ajacaxtli), which are supported by the retrieved context but does not include the huehuetl and teponaztli, the specific instruments mentioned in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer provides additional relevant instruments, it misses the core instruments highlighted in the Gold Answer, and the retrieved context does not explicitly confirm all the instruments listed in the Model Answer."
