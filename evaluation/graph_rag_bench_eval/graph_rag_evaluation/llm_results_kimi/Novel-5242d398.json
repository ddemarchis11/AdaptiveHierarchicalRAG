  "gold_answer": "Dear Diary, As the spine, I form the backbone of the chest and keep everything upright. I'm made of bones, and in children, those bones bend easily as they grow. I work closely with muscles and help support the lungs and heart inside the chest, which is made up of the spine, ribs, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones. It's a big responsibility, but I like helping children grow tall and strong!",
  "llm_answer": "Dear Diary,  \nToday I held up my person’s head and chest again, made of twenty-four little bones with springy gristle cushions between them so every bend, hop, and twist feels smooth instead of jolting. Because my child is still young, my bones are soft and bendy, so I reminded them to sit and stand straight—if they slump too long, I could grow crooked and crowd the lungs. I love watching them grow taller each night while they sleep, knowing that as long as they’re careful, I’ll keep them strong, straight, and ready for tomorrow’s running and climbing.",

If the starch in your mother's starch-box at home should be changed into sugar, you would think it a very strange thing. Every year, in the spring-time, many thousand pounds of starch are changed into sugar in a hidden, quiet way, so that most of us think nothing about it. STARCH AND SUGAR. All kinds of grain are full of starch. If you plant them in the ground, where they are kept moist and warm, they begin to sprout and grow, to send little roots down into the earth, and little stems up into the sunshine. These little roots and stems must be fed with sugar; thus, in a wise way, which is too wonderful for you to understand, as soon as the seed begins to sprout, its starch begins to turn into sugar. [Illustration] If you should chew two grains of wheat, one before sprouting and one after, you could tell by the taste that this is true. Barley is a kind of grain from which the brewer makes beer. He must first turn its starch into sugar, so he begins by sprouting his grain. Of course he does not plant it in the ground, because it would need to be quickly dug up again. He keeps it warm and moist in a place where he can watch it, and stop the sprouting just in time to save the sugar, before it is used to feed the root",

Children's bones have more gristle than those of older people; so children's bones bend easily. I know a lady who has one leg shorter than the other. This makes her lame, and she has to wear a boot with iron supports three or four inches high, in order to walk at all. One day she told me how she became lame. \"I remember,\" she said, \"when I was between three and four years old, sitting one day in my high chair at the table, and twisting one foot under the little step of the chair. The next morning I felt lame; but nobody could tell what was the matter. At last, the doctors found out that the trouble all came from that twist. It had gone too far to be cured. Before I had this boot, I could only walk with a crutch.\" CARE OF THE SPINE. Because the spine is made of little bones with cushions between them, it bends easily, and children sometimes bend it more than they ought. If you lean over your book or your writing or any other work, the elastic cushions may get so pressed on the inner edge that they do not easily spring back into shape.

This bending over, also cramps the lungs, so that they do not have all the room they need for breathing. While you are young, your bones are easily bent. One shoulder or one hip gets higher than the other, if you stand unevenly. This is more serious, because you are growing, and you may grow crooked before you know it. Now that you know how soft your bones are, and how easily they bend, you will surely be careful to sit and stand erect. Do not twist your legs, or arms, or shoulders; for you want to grow into straight and graceful men and women, instead of being round-shouldered, or hump-backed, or lame, all your lives. When people are old, their bones contain more lime, and, therefore, break more easily. You should be kindly helpful to old people, so that they may not fall, and possibly break their bones. CARE OF THE FEET. Healthy children are always out-growing their shoes, and sometimes faster than they wear them out. Tight shoes cause corns and in-growing nails and other sore places on the feet. All of these are very hard to get rid of. No one should wear a shoe that pinches or hurts the foot. OUGHT A BOY TO USE TOBACCO? Perhaps some boy will say: \"Grown people are",

Some are large; and some, very small. There are long-hones in your legs and arms, and many short ones in your fingers and toes. The backbone is called the spine. [Illustration: _Backbone of a fish._] If you look at the backbone of a fish, you can see that it is made up-of many little bones. Your own spine is formed in much the same way, of twenty-four small bones. An elastic cushion of gristle (gr[)i]s'l) fits nicely in between each little bone and the next. When you bend, these cushions are pressed together on one side and stretched on the other. They settle back into their first shape, as soon as you stand straight again.
