  "question": "According to the narrative's philosophical discourse, how are machines described in relation to human organisms, particularly in being portrayed as extensions of the human body, and what potential developments are discussed regarding their chemical and mechanical powers, including the role of molecular movements and the possibility that such movements may eventually lead to fission, thereby allowing machines to supersede humans?",
  "gold_answer": "Machines are described as extensions of the human organism and may eventually supersede humans. They possess chemical and mechanical powers, where chemical powers involve molecular movements, and these molecular movements may lead to fission.",
  "llm_answer": "Machines are portrayed as extensions of the human organism—limbs with immeasurably more power and ever subtler fingertips—yet still dependent on human consciousness for guidance. The text speculates that, through molecular refinements, they might evolve self-supply, self-repair, and ultimately reproduce by fission or budding, whereupon natural selection would drive the now-superfluous, noisy human race to extinction.",

I have a sort of valet and factotum, an excellent, respectable servant, whose spelling is so unvitiated by non-phonetic superfluities that he writes _night_ as _nit_.

I have sometimes laid traps for his astonishment, but he has escaped them all, either by a respectful neutrality, as of one who would not appear to notice that his master had been taking too much wine, or else by that strong persuasion of his all-knowingness which makes it simply impossible for him to feel himself newly informed.
