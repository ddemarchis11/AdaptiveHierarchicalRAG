The fact was generally circulated among the spectators that the \"two gents in high hats\" had come in a carriage, and this and their patent-leather boots made them objects of keen interest. It was even whispered that they were the \"parties\" who were putting up the money to back the Black Diamond against the \"Hester Street Jackson.\" This in itself entitled them to respect. Van Bibber was asked to hold the watch, but he wisely declined the honor, which was given to Andy Spielman, the sporting reporter of the _Track and Ring_, whose watch-case was covered with diamonds, and was just the sort of a watch a timekeeper should hold. It was two o'clock before \"Dutchy\" Mack's backer threw the sponge into the air, and three before they reached the city. They had another reporter in the cab with them besides the gentleman who had bravely held the watch in the face of several offers to \"do for\" him; and as Van Bibber was ravenously hungry, and as he doubted that he could get anything at that hour at the club, they accepted Spielman's invitation and went for a porterhouse steak and onions at the Owl's Nest, Gus McGowan's all-night restaurant on Third Avenue.",

There was a great house at the corner of the avenue and the cross-street on which he was walking. The house faced the avenue and a stone wall ran back to the brown stone stable which opened on the side street.

Some disturbance arose hereupon, for the Musk-rat began to make himself obtrusive, believing in the Owl's opinion of his powers, and feeling that he could have produced the honey if he had thought of it; until an experimental Butcher-bird proposed to anatomise him as a help to decision.
