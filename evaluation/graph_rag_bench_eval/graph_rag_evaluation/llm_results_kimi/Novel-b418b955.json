There was neither stupidity nor servility, but a sort of dignified independence. No pressing to buy, no looking out for gratuities, only a kindly politeness, which did not fail even when we departed, taking only a few little ornaments. We should have liked to carry off a cart-load--especially two enormous vases and a chimney-piece--but travellers have limits to luggage, and purse as well. Pretty Poltesco! we left it with regret, but we were in the hands of the ever-watchful Charles, anxious that we should see as much as possible. \"The driving-road goes far inland, but there's a splendid cliff-walk from Poltesco to Cadgwith direct.

But we had left the guide-book at home, with the so longed-for bathing gowns, and Charles was not of archaeological mind, so I heard nothing and investigated nothing. Except, indeed, numerous huge hand-bills, posted on barn doors and gates, informing the inhabitants that an Exhibition of Fine Arts, admittance one shilling, was on view close by. Charles was most anxious I should stop and visit it, saying it was \"very fine.\" But as within the last twelvemonth I had seen the Royal Academy, Grosvenor Gallery, and most of the galleries and museums in Italy, the Fine Art Exhibition of Ruan Minor was not overwhelmingly attractive.

She followed me, and triumphantly passed me, though she had to carry a bag of potatoes on her back. I wondered if her feeling was pity or envy towards another old person who had to carry nothing but her own self. Which, alas! was enough! She and I sat down together on the hill-side and had a chat, while I waited for the two little black dots which I could see moving round the opposite headland.
