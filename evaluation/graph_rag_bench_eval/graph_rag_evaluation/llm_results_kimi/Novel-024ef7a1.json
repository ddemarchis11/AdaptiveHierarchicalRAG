  "gold_answer": "The chest is made up of ribs, shoulder-blades, collar-bones, and the spine, and it houses the heart and lungs.",
  "llm_answer": "The context does not provide a detailed list of the structural components that make up the chest, but it does mention that bones form a case or box (the chest) and asks which organs are located in the chest. However, it does not explicitly name those organs in the provided excerpts. Therefore, the text does not fully support a complete answer to both parts of the question.",
