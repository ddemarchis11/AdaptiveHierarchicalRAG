I remember of going to Dan Rice's circus that night and felt as chipper as a young kitten. After the circus was out I went back to the office to see if any late news had been received. I met Gov. Marshall at the door, and with tears rolling down his cheeks he informed me that the Union force had met with a great reverse and he was afraid the country would never recover from it. But it did, and the governor was afterward one of the bravest of the brave in battling for his country's honor. Printers were very patriotic, and when Father Abraham called for \"three hundred thousand more\" in July, 1862, so many enlisted that it was with much difficulty that the paper was enabled to present a respectable appearance. The Press advertised for anything that could set type to come in and help it out. I remember one man applying who said he never had set any type, but he had a good theoretical knowledge of the business. One evening an old gentleman by the name of Metcalf, father of the late T.M. Metcalf, came wandering into the office about 9 o'clock and told the foreman he thought he could help him out. He was given a piece of copy and worked faithfully until the paper went to press.

Occasionally the candidate would confess to having been more of a transgresser than his questioners had anticipated. The following is a sample of the questions asked a candidate for admission: Grand Commander to candidate, \"Are you in favor of the acquisition of the Island of Cuba?\" Candidate, \"I am.\" Grand Commander, \"In case of an invasion of the island, would you lie awake nights and steal into the enemy's camp?\" Candidate, \"I would.\" Grand Commander, \"Let it be recorded, he will lie and steal,\" and then an immense gong at the far end of the hall would be sounded and the candidate would imagine that the day of judgment had come.

Peal-ringing is another pastime of the kind which may be regarded as pre-eminently national to England. The bells constituting a peal are frequently of the number of eight, attuned to the diatonic scale. Also peals of ten bells, and even of twelve, are occasionally formed. A peculiar feature of peal-ringing is that the bells, which are provided with clappers, are generally swung so forcibly as to raise the mouth completely upwards. The largest peal, and one of the finest, is at Exeter cathedral: another celebrated one is that of St. Margaret’s, Leicester, which consists of ten bells. Peal-ringing is of an early date in England; Egelric, abbot of Croyland, is recorded to have cast about the year 960 a set of six bells.

This class were employed by the proprietors of the wood yards, to cut wood by the cord--for one hundred cords they received fifty dollars. Brindle Bill was five feet and eight inches high, with square shoulders and as strong as a buffalo--and although he was classed with the floating population, he had been in that locality for more than a year and was a shining light at _headquarters._ This was the resort of all who claimed to be fond of fun. It was an old cabin that was built by some early backwoodsmen, who had deserted it and moved on. It was some distance from the river, and left unoccupied by the woodmen. Situated in the edge of a small cane-brake, a large quantity of cane had been cut to clear the way, and piled against the west end of the cabin. Here the jug was kept. These men had no brilliantly lighted saloon for a resort, but human nature is the same under all circumstances.

They soon adopted the Persian instruments, and there can be no doubt that the musical system exhibited by the earliest Arab writers whose works on the theory of music have been preserved was based upon an older system of the Persians. In these works the octave is divided in seventeen _one-third-tones_--intervals which are still made use of in the east. Some of the Arabian instruments are constructed so as to enable the performer to produce the intervals with exactness. The frets on the lute and tamboura, for instance, are regulated with a view to this object. [Illustration] The Arabs had to some extent become acquainted with many of the Persian instruments before the time of their conquest of Persia. An Arab musician of the name of Nadr Ben el-Hares Ben Kelde is recorded as having been sent to the Persian king Khosroo Purviz, in the sixth century, for the purpose of learning Persian singing and performing on the lute.
