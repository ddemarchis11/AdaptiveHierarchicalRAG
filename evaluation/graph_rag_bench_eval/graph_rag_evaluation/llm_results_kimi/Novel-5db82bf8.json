The following is a sample of the questions asked a candidate for admission: Grand Commander to candidate, \"Are you in favor of the acquisition of the Island of Cuba?\" Candidate, \"I am.\" Grand Commander, \"In case of an invasion of the island, would you lie awake nights and steal into the enemy's camp?\" Candidate, \"I would.\" Grand Commander, \"Let it be recorded, he will lie and steal,\" and then an immense gong at the far end of the hall would be sounded and the candidate would imagine that the day of judgment had come.
