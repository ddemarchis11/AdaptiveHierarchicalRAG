As you would be very badly off if you could not think, the brain is your most precious part, and you have a strong box made of bone to keep it in. [Illustration: _Diagram of the nervous system._] We will call the brain the central telegraph office. Little white cords, called nerves, connect the brain with the rest of the body. A large cord called the spinal cord, lies safely in a bony case made by the spine, and many nerves branch off from this. If you put your finger on a hot stove, in an instant a message goes on the nerve telegraph to the brain. It tells that wise thinking part that your finger will burn, if it stays on the stove. In another instant, the brain sends back a message to the muscles that move that finger, saying: \"Contract quickly, bend the joint, and take that poor finger away so that it will not be burned.\" You can hardly believe that there was time for all this sending of messages; for as soon as you felt the hot stove, you pulled your finger away.

Fat meat could not work your joints for you as the muscles do. Alcohol often changes a part of the muscles to fat, and so takes away a part of their strength. In this way, people often grow very fleshy from drinking beer, because it contains alcohol, as you will soon learn. But they can not work any better on account of having this fat.

Sometimes a door or gate is made to shut itself, if you leave it open. This can be done by means of a wide rubber strap, one end of which is fastened to the frame of the door near the hinge, and the other end to the door, out near its edge. When we push open the door, the rubber strap is stretched; but as soon as we have passed through, the strap tightens, draws the door back, and shuts it. If you stretch out your right arm, and clasp the upper part tightly with your left hand, then work the elbow joint strongly back and forth, you can feel something under your hand draw up, and then lengthen out again, each time you bend the joint.

As soon as it touches any thing cold, it turns into drops of water. When we boil water and turn it into steam, and then turn the steam back into water, we have distilled the water. We say vapor instead of steam, when we talk about the boiling of alcohol. It takes less heat to turn alcohol to vapor than to turn water to steam; so, if we put over the fire some liquid that contains alcohol, and begin to collect the vapor as it rises, we shall get alcohol first, and then water. But the alcohol will not be pure alcohol; it will be part water, because it is so ready to mix with water that it has to be distilled many times to be pure. But each time it is distilled, it will become stronger, because there is a little more alcohol and a little less water. In this way, brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are distilled, from wine, cider, and the liquors which have been made from corn, rye, or barley. The cider, wine, and beer had but little alcohol in them. The brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are nearly one-half alcohol. A glass of strong liquor which has been made by distilling, will injure any one more,",

If the starch in your mother's starch-box at home should be changed into sugar, you would think it a very strange thing. Every year, in the spring-time, many thousand pounds of starch are changed into sugar in a hidden, quiet way, so that most of us think nothing about it. STARCH AND SUGAR. All kinds of grain are full of starch. If you plant them in the ground, where they are kept moist and warm, they begin to sprout and grow, to send little roots down into the earth, and little stems up into the sunshine. These little roots and stems must be fed with sugar; thus, in a wise way, which is too wonderful for you to understand, as soon as the seed begins to sprout, its starch begins to turn into sugar. [Illustration] If you should chew two grains of wheat, one before sprouting and one after, you could tell by the taste that this is true. Barley is a kind of grain from which the brewer makes beer. He must first turn its starch into sugar, so he begins by sprouting his grain. Of course he does not plant it in the ground, because it would need to be quickly dug up again. He keeps it warm and moist in a place where he can watch it, and stop the sprouting just in time to save the sugar, before it is used to feed the root",
