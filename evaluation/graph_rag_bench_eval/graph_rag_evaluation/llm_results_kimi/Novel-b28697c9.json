  "gold_answer": "Alcohol hurts the stomach and puts fat into muscles; muscles move the chest.",
  "llm_answer": "Alcohol harms the stomach by injuring the gastric juice so it cannot mix with food, and it also weakens muscles and the nerves that direct them. Since both the chest muscles and the stomach rely on these nerves for coordinated action, alcohol disrupts their function. Therefore, alcohol impairs the body’s ability to move the chest effectively.",

The muscles of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you breathe. All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is directed by the nerves.

As soon as it touches any thing cold, it turns into drops of water. When we boil water and turn it into steam, and then turn the steam back into water, we have distilled the water. We say vapor instead of steam, when we talk about the boiling of alcohol. It takes less heat to turn alcohol to vapor than to turn water to steam; so, if we put over the fire some liquid that contains alcohol, and begin to collect the vapor as it rises, we shall get alcohol first, and then water. But the alcohol will not be pure alcohol; it will be part water, because it is so ready to mix with water that it has to be distilled many times to be pure. But each time it is distilled, it will become stronger, because there is a little more alcohol and a little less water. In this way, brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are distilled, from wine, cider, and the liquors which have been made from corn, rye, or barley. The cider, wine, and beer had but little alcohol in them. The brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are nearly one-half alcohol. A glass of strong liquor which has been made by distilling, will injure any one more,",

If the starch in your mother's starch-box at home should be changed into sugar, you would think it a very strange thing. Every year, in the spring-time, many thousand pounds of starch are changed into sugar in a hidden, quiet way, so that most of us think nothing about it. STARCH AND SUGAR. All kinds of grain are full of starch. If you plant them in the ground, where they are kept moist and warm, they begin to sprout and grow, to send little roots down into the earth, and little stems up into the sunshine. These little roots and stems must be fed with sugar; thus, in a wise way, which is too wonderful for you to understand, as soon as the seed begins to sprout, its starch begins to turn into sugar. [Illustration] If you should chew two grains of wheat, one before sprouting and one after, you could tell by the taste that this is true. Barley is a kind of grain from which the brewer makes beer. He must first turn its starch into sugar, so he begins by sprouting his grain. Of course he does not plant it in the ground, because it would need to be quickly dug up again. He keeps it warm and moist in a place where he can watch it, and stop the sprouting just in time to save the sugar, before it is used to feed the root",

They are always eating apples, or candy, or something, so that their stomachs have no chance to rest. If the stomach does not rest, it will wear out the same as a machine would.

If a man is cold, the tobacco deadens his nerves so that he does not feel the cold and does not take pains to make himself warmer. If a man is tired, or in trouble, tobacco will not really rest him or help him out of his trouble. It only puts his nerves to sleep and helps him think that he is not tired, and that he does not need to overcome his troubles. It puts his nerves to sleep very much as alcohol does, and helps him to be contented with what ought not to content him.
