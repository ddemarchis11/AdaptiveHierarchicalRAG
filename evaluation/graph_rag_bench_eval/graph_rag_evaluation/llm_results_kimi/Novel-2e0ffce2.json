  "question": "Write a diary entry as the Parrot, describing your life with your mistress, the farewell, and being snatched away, while referencing the trouble caused to her lover.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — My days with my mistress were filled with warmth and chatter. Today, I said farewell to Corinna, her eyes glistening with sorrow. I was snatched away by envy, separated from her gentle hands. I have heard it said that my mistress is born to be a cause of trouble to her lover, and perhaps, even my loss plays a part in the tangled affairs of the heart.",
  "llm_answer": "I perched on my usual spot, preening my feathers while my mistress, the fair princess, counted her growing hoard of rubies and sapphires; she had just bade farewell to the Red Chief and his foresters, their parting gift clinking beside the butterman’s bag. Suddenly a waltzing raccoon seized me round the body, whirled me off my perch, and in the dizzy spin I glimpsed her lover—the Red Chief—bowing low, unaware that my shrieks were adding to the chaos that would delay his promised devotion. Bruin’s great paw then thudded nearby, splattering custard pie everywhere, and as I flapped to regain balance I feared the whole disorder might expose the princess’s gem-laden journey and bring her lover nothing but trouble.",

No one had thought of his being an impostor; but when the princess fixed her clear eyes on him and asked him that familiar question, which he had been in the habit of hearing many times a day for a great part of his life, the guilty butterman thought himself detected, and shook in his guilty shoes.

When they came to the open country, the robber chieftain took his leave of the princess, with profound bows and many protestations of devotion, and returned to his band, who were already preparing to plunge into the impenetrable thickets of the midforest.

He stepped hastily back to avoid treading on them, lost his balance, and sat down heavily--on the custard pie! At the crash of the platter, the squirrel released Miss Mary, who flew screaming to her perch; the grandmother wrung her hands and lamented, begging to be told what had happened, and who was hurt; and the unfortunate Bruin, staggering to his feet, stared aghast at the ruin he had wrought. It was a very complete ruin, certainly, for the platter was in small fragments, while most of its contents were clinging to his own shaggy black coat. \"Well, old fellow,\" said",
