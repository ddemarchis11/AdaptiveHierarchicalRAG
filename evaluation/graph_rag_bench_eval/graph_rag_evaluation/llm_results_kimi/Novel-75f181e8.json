We promised to be ready in half an hour, so as to waste nothing of this lovely day, in which we had determined to enjoy ourselves. Who could help it? It was delightful to wake up early and refreshed, and come down to this sunshiny, cheerful breakfast-table, where, though nothing was grand, all was thoroughly comfortable. \"I'm sure you're very kind, ladies, to be so pleased with everything,\" apologised our bright-looking handmaiden; \"and since you really wish to keep this room\"--a very homely parlour which we had chosen in preference to a larger one, because it looked on the sea--\"I only wish things was better for you; still, if you can make shift--\" Well, if travellers cannot \"make shift\" with perfectly clean tidy rooms, well-cooked plain food, and more than civil, actually kindly, attendance, they ought to be ashamed of themselves! So we declared we would settle down in the evidently despised little parlour. It was not an aesthetic apartment, certainly.
