Those boiling waves, roaring each after each through the arch below; and those jagged rocks, round which innumerable sea-birds were flying--one could quite imagine that were any luckless vessel to find itself in or near the Frying-pan, it would never get out again. To meditative minds there is something very startling in the perpetual contrast between the summer tourist-life, so cheerful and careless, and the winter life of the people here, which must be so full of privations; for one half the year there is nothing to do, no market for serpentine, and almost no fishing possible: they have to live throughout the dark days upon the hay made while the sun shines. \"No, no,\" said one of the Lizard folk, whom I asked if there was much drunkenness thereabout, for I had seen absolutely none; \"no, us don't drink; us can't afford it. Winter's a bad time for we--sometimes for four months a man doesn't earn a halfpenny. He has to save in summer, or he'd starve the rest of the year.\" Which apparently is not altogether bad for him. I have seldom seen, in any part of England or Scotland, such an honest, independent, respectable race as the working people on this coast, and indeed throughout Cornwall.

Small cares and worries dwindled down or melted away--as the petty uglinesses around melted in the radiance of this glorious harvest moon, which seemed to wrap one round in a silent peace, like the \"garment of praise,\" which David speaks about--in exchange for \"the spirit of heaviness.\" DAY THE EIGHTH And seven days were all we could allow ourselves at the Lizard, if we meant to see the rest of Cornwall. We began to reckon with sore hearts that five days were already gone, and it seemed as if we had not seen half we ought to see, even of our near surroundings. \"We will take no excursion to-day. We will just have our bath at Housel Cove and then we will wander about the shore, and examine the Lizard Lights.

I chronicle with shame that the careful and courteous explanations of that most intelligent young man, who met us at the door of the huge white building, apparently quite glad to have an opportunity of conducting us through it, were entirely thrown away. We mounted ladders, we looked at Brobdingnagian lamps, we poked into mysterious machinery for lighting them and for sounding the fog-horn, we listened to all that was told us, and tried to look as if we took it in. Very much interested we could not but be at such wonderful results of man's invention, but as for comprehending! we came away with our minds as dark as when we went in. I have always found through life that, next to being clever, the safest thing is to know one's own ignorance and acknowledge it.

There was in one of our guide-books a most glowing description of the Old Inn, and also an extract from a poem, apostrophising the charms of Mary Mundy. When we said we knew the enthusiastic Scotch Professor who had written it, we felt that we rose a step in the estimation of Charles. \"And Mary will be so pleased to see anybody who knows the gentleman\"--in Cornwall the noted Greek Professor was merely \"the gentleman.\" \"She's got his poem in her visitors' book and his portrait in her album. I do hope Mary will be at home.\" But fate was against us. When we reached Mullion and drove up to the door of the Old Inn, there darted out to meet us, not Mary, but an individual concerning whom Fame has been unjustly silent. \"It's only Mary's brother,\" said Charles, with an accent of deep disappointment.
