But the voice was not German. Rudolph heard her subside with little flouncings, and felt his ears grow warm and red. Delighted, embarrassed, he at last took sufficient courage to steal side-glances. The first showed her to be young, fair-haired, and smartly attired in the plainest and coolest of white; the second, not so young, but very charming, with a demure downcast look, and a deft control of her spoon that, to Rudolph's eyes, was splendidly fastidious; at the third, he was shocked to encounter the last flitting light of a counter-glance, from large, dark-blue eyes, not devoid of amusement. \"She laughs at me!\" fumed the young man, inwardly. He was angry, conscious of those unlucky wing-and-wing ears, vexed at his own boldness. \"I have been offensive. She laughs at me.\" He generalized from long inexperience of a subject to which he had given acutely interested thought: \"They always do.\" Anger did not prevent him, however, from noting that his neighbor traveled alone,",

It was a disappointing trifle: Mrs. Forrester waited below for her husband, to walk home. \"Can't leave now,\" snapped Gilly. \"I'll be along, tell her--\" \"Had she better go alone?\" suggested Heywood. \"No; right you are.\" The other swept a fretful eye about the company. \"But this business begins to look urgent.--Here, somebody we can spare. You go, Hackh, there's a good chap.\" Chantel dropped the helmet he had caught up. Bowing stiffly, Rudolph marched across the room and down the stairs. His face, pale at the late spectacle, had grown red and sulky, \"Can spare me, can you?--I'm the one.\" He descended, muttering. Viewing himself thus, morosely, as rejected of men, he reached the compound gate to fare no better with the woman. She stood waiting in the shadow of the wall; and as he drew unwillingly near, the sight of her--to his shame and quick dismay--made his heart leap in welcome. She wore the coolest and severest white, but at her throat the same small furbelow, every line of which he had known aboard ship, in the days of his first exile and of his recent",

His quick blue eyes danced with the light of some ineffable joke. He seemed a conjurer, creating banquets for sheer mischief in the wilderness. \"There's a soup!\" he had proclaimed. \"Patent, mind ye! Stick a knife into the tin, and she 'eats 'erself!\" Among all the revelers, one face alone showed melancholy. Chantel, at the foot of the table, sat unregarded by all save Rudolph, who now and then caught from him a look filled with gloom and suspicion. It was beside Rudolph that Mrs. Forrester laughed and chattered, calling all eyes toward her, and yet finding private intervals in which to dart a sidelong shaft at her neighbor. Rudolph's ears shone coral pink; for now again he was aboard ship, hiding a secret at once dizzy, dangerous, and entrancing. Across the talk, the wine, the many lights, came the triumph of seeing that other hostile face, glowering in defeat.

Above the sallow brown face, his chestnut hair shone oddly, close-cropped and vigorous. \"Maskee, can't be helped.--O Boy, one sherry-bitters, one bamboo!\" \"To our better acquaintance,\" said Rudolph, as they raised their glasses. \"What? Oh, yes, thanks,\" the other laughed. \"Any one would know you for a griffin here, Mr. Hackh. You've not forgotten your manners yet.\" When they had sat down to dinner in another white-washed room, and had undertaken the promised rice and chicken, he laughed again, somewhat bitterly. \"Better acquaintance--no fear! You'll be so well acquainted with us all that you'll wish you never clapped eyes on us.\" He drained his whiskey and soda, signaled for more, and added: \"Were you ever cooped up, yachting, with a chap you detested?

He composed melancholy German verses in a note-book. He recalled famous exiles--Camoens, Napoleon, Byron--and essayed to copy something of all three in his attitude. He cherished the thought that he, clerk at twenty-one, was now agent at twenty-two, and traveling toward a house with servants, off there beyond the turn of the Canal, beyond the curve of the globe. But for all this, Rudolph Hackh felt young, homesick, timid of the future, and already oppressed with the distance, the age, the manifold, placid mystery of China. Toward that mystery, meanwhile, the ship began to creep. Behind her, houses, multi- funnels, scrubby trees, slowly swung to blot out the glowing Mediterranean and the western hemisphere.
