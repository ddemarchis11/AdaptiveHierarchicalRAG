  "llm_answer": "The Romans did not use the names “Berbers” or “Moors”; the context states that the Romans transmitted many names of other aboriginal tribes, some of which resemble present-day fractions, but the five original peoples listed (including those ancestral to the Berbers) “do not appear to have been known to the Romans.”  \nThis indicates that the Romans were aware of various North-African tribes yet did not clearly distinguish the specific groups later called Berbers or Moors.",
