A ghostly spot, and full of many ghostly stories besides the legend of Arthur. Here Tregeagle, the great demon of Cornwall, once had his dwelling, until, selling his soul to the devil, his home was sunk to the bottom of the mere, and himself is heard of stormy nights, wailing round it with other ghost-demons, in which the Cornish mind still lingeringly believes. Visionary packs of hounds; a shadowy coach and horses, which drives round and round the pool, and then drives into it; flitting lights, kindled by no human hand, in places where no human foot could go--all these tales are still told by the country folk, and we might have heard them all. Might also have seen, in fancy, the flash of the \"brand Excalibur\"; heard the wailing song of the three queens; and pictured the dying Arthur lying on the lap of his sister Morgane la Faye.
