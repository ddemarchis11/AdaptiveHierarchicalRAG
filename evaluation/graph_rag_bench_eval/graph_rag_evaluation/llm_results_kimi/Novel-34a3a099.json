All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva may be able to mix with it. Otherwise, the starch may not be changed; and if one part of your body neglects its work, another part will have more than its share to do. That is hardly fair. If you swallow your food in a hurry and do not let the saliva do its work, the stomach will have extra work. But it will find it hard to do more than its own part, and, perhaps, will complain. It can not speak in words; but will by aching, and that is almost as plain as words. SWALLOWING. Next to the chewing, comes the swallowing. Is there any thing wonderful about that? We have two passages leading down our throats. One is to the lungs, for breathing; the other, to the stomach, for swallowing. Do you wonder why the food does not sometimes go down the wrong way? The windpipe leading to the lungs is in front of the other tube. It has at its top a little trap-door. This opens when we breathe and shuts when we swallow, so that the food slips over it safely into the passage behind, which leads to the stomach. If you try to speak while you have food in your mouth, this little door has to open, and some bit of food may",

[Illustration] It is the nature of alcohol to make the person who takes a little of it, in wine, or any other drink, want more and more alcohol. When one goes on, thus taking more and more of the drinks that contain alcohol, he is called a drunkard. In this way wine has made many drunkards. Alcohol hurts both the body and mind. It changes the person who drinks it. It will make a good and kind person cruel and bad; and will make a bad person worse. Every one who takes wine does not become a drunkard, but you are not sure that you will not, if you drink it. You should not drink wine, because there is alcohol in it. CIDER. Cider is made from apples. In a few hours after the juice is pressed out of the apples, if it is left open to the air the sugar begins to change. Like the sugar in the grape, it changes into alcohol and bubbles of gas. At first, there is but little alcohol in cider, but a little of this poison is dangerous.

The sugar in the grape-juice is changing into something else. It is turning into alcohol and a gas[A] that moves about in little bubbles in the liquid, and rising to the top, goes off into the air. The alcohol is a thin liquid which, mixed with the water, remains in the grape-juice. The sugar is gone; alcohol and the bubbles of gas are left in its place. This alcohol is a liquid poison. A little of it will harm any one who drinks it; much of it would kill the drinker. Ripe grapes are good food; but grape-juice, when its sugar has turned to alcohol, is not a safe drink for any one. It is poisoned by the alcohol. WINE. This changed grape-juice is called wine. It is partly water, partly alcohol, and it still has the grape flavor in it. Wine is also made from currants, elderberries, and other fruits, in very much the same way as from grapes. People sometimes make it at home from the fruits that grow in their own gardens, and think there is no alcohol in it, because they do not put any in.

HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY. But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down into the stomach. There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric juice, until it is all a gray fluid. Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which leads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into the blood. The blood carries it to the heart. The heart pumps it out with the blood into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle, and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain.
