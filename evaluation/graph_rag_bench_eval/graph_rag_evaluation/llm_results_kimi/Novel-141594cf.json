  "gold_answer": "Major Tarver is shown being introduced by Blore and ultimately accepted by Salome, illustrating the process by which new individuals are incorporated into the group.",
  "llm_answer": "The passages do not show Blore actually ushering Major Tarver in, nor do they trace a step-by-step process of Tarver’s acceptance by Salome. All that can be said from the text is that Tarver eventually proposes to Salome and she is urged to accept him for his health’s sake, but the narrative itself does not depict the moment of, or reasons for, her final acceptance.",
