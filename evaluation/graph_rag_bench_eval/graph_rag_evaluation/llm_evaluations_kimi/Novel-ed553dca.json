  "question": "While held captive in Dr. O'Shaughnessy's house, to whom did Eileen Macarthy direct her questions regarding her condition and her wish?",
  "gold_answer": "Eileen Macarthy asked questions to the doctor.",
  "llm_answer": "The provided context does not mention Eileen Macarthy, Dr. O'Shaughnessy's house, or any captivity scenario, so it cannot answer the question.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the context does not mention Eileen Macarthy or Dr. O'Shaughnessy's house, which is correct. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or reasoning, even though the Gold Answer is straightforward ('Eileen Macarthy asked questions to the doctor'). The Model Answer neither aligns with the Gold Answer nor provides any relevant information."
