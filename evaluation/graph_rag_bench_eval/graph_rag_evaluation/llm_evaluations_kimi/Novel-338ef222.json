    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about the novel 'Dragon's Blood' or the character 'the Sword-Pen.' However, it fails to answer the user's question using internal knowledge, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. The Gold Answer clearly states that Fang is known as 'the Sword-Pen,' but this fact is not addressed in the Model Answer."
