    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not specify to whom Mrs. B. made her remarks, which is faithful to the context provided. However, the Gold Answer explicitly states that Mrs. B. remarked to Miss Inglis, and the Model Answer fails to include this information, resulting in a score of 0 for correctness and evidence coverage."
