  "llm_answer": "The provided context does not mention John Neilson’s stance on the Ninety-Two Resolutions, any break with Papineau, or his alignment with Augustin Cuvillier, so these aspects of their relationship cannot be answered from the given passages.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about John Neilson's opposition to the Ninety-Two Resolutions, his break with Papineau, or his alignment with Augustin Cuvillier. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or reasoning, which would have been possible given the Gold Answer. The response is faithful to the context but does not address the key facts required by the question."
