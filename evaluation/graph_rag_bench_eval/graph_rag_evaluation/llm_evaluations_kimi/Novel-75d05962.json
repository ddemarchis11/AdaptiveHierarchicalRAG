    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not support the question, but it fails to provide an answer to the question itself. The Gold Answer outlines the lord's actions and their significance, which the Model Answer does not address. Additionally, the retrieved context is irrelevant to the question, so the Model Answer cannot be grounded or provide evidence coverage."
