    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the context does not specify the name of the primary home for Toto and his grandmother, while the Gold Answer clearly identifies it as 'Cottage.' The context does not provide explicit evidence for 'Cottage,' but the Model Answer fails to align with the Gold Answer and does not address the question correctly."
