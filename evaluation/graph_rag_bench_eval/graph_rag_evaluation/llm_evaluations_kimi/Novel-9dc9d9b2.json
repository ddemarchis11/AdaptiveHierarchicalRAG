    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not specify where Dr. Wolfred Nelson was held as a prisoner, which is faithful to the context provided. However, it fails to answer the user's question, which is explicitly addressed in the Gold Answer ('Montreal'). The Model Answer does not include the key fact from the Gold Answer, resulting in low evidence coverage and incorrectness."
