  "gold_answer": "Raegen wanted to lie hidden in his own cellar and his own garret.",
  "llm_answer": "The provided context does not mention a character named Raegen or describe any scene in which someone is fleeing the police after a violent encounter. Therefore, I cannot answer where Raegen wishes to hide or why he would consider any location safe.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question about Raegen's hiding locations and their perceived safety. While the retrieved context does not provide relevant information about Raegen, the Gold Answer clearly states the locations (his own cellar and garret). The Model Answer does not utilize internal knowledge to provide the correct response, resulting in a complete failure to answer the question."
