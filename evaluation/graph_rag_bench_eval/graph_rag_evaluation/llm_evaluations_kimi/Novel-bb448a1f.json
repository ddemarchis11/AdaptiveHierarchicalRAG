  "gold_answer": "Boxes",
  "llm_answer": "The provided context does not describe any scene in which an ill-looking man enters Toto's cottage and searches the kitchen, so I cannot say what objects he opened.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the context does not describe the scene, but it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or reasoning. The Gold Answer specifies 'boxes,' which the Model Answer does not mention, and it does not attempt to address the question beyond referencing the irrelevant context."
