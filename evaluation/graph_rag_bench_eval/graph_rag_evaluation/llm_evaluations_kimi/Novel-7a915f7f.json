    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about Dr. Elsie Inglis's contributions, such as co-founding the Medical College for Women or her involvement in the Women's Liberal League. However, it fails to answer the question using external knowledge or internal understanding, which would have been appropriate given the lack of relevant context. Thus, the answer is faithful to the context but does not address the user's query or cover the key facts from the Gold Answer."
