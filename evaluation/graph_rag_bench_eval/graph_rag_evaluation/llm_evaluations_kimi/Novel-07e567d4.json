    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the context does not specify where Raegen wished to hide, which is accurate based on the retrieved context. However, the Gold Answer explicitly mentions that Raegen wanted to hide in the cellar and the garret, which the Model Answer fails to address. Thus, the Model Answer is incorrect in relation to the question and does not cover the key facts from the Gold Answer."
