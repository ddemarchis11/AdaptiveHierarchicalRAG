    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the context does not specify the part of the body that adapts to variations in food, whereas the Gold Answer clearly identifies the digestive apparatus as the adapting part. The retrieved context does not provide relevant information to support the Model Answer, and it fails to address the core fact from the Gold Answer."
