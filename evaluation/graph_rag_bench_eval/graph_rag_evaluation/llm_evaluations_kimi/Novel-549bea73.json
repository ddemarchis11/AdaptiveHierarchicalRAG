    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about the connection between government neglect in Minnesota and Indian protests. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or reasoning, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. The Gold Answer provides a clear connection, but the Model Answer does not address it, resulting in low correctness and evidence coverage scores."
