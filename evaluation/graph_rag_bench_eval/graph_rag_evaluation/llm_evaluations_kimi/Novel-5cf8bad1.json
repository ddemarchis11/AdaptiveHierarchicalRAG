  "llm_answer": "The context shows that Dr. Inglis raised and led an 80-woman Scottish Women’s Hospitals unit to serve the Serbian Army, gaining British permission for the venture and working with wounded soldiers for fifteen months. It mentions she qualified by passing the Triple Qualification examination in 1892 after clinical work in Glasgow, but it does not list any formal honours or awards she received.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Dr. Inglis's leadership of the Scottish Women's Hospitals and her work aiding the Serbian Army, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it omits other achievements such as addressing the Sanitary Congress, extending Red Cross work, and earning her M.B., C.M. degree in 1899. Additionally, the Model Answer does not provide information on formal recognitions, which were part of the User's question. While some details are grounded in the context, the Model Answer includes unsupported claims about the Triple Qualification examination in 1892, which is not mentioned in the Gold Answer or directly supported by the retrieved context."
