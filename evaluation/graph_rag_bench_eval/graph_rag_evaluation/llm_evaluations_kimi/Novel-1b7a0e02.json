    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about Charles calling out 'The Lizard Lights' during the first evening at The Lizard. However, it fails to answer the question directly using internal knowledge or reasoning, which would have been possible given the Gold Answer. Thus, the answer is incorrect in terms of correctness and evidence coverage, but it remains faithful to the provided context."
