    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not correctly address the question, as it fails to mention the items 'blankets and quilts' that are included alongside burnouses, as stated in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it does not provide the required factual information from the Gold Answer, resulting in low correctness and evidence coverage scores."
