  "llm_answer": "Hamburg played a key role in Sterne’s German reception: J. J. C. Bode, while resident there, edited the Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent and used the paper in 1764 to publish an early, corrective review-translation of Tristram Shandy; a decade later he issued his own full German version from Hamburg, and the same newspaper continued to give the novel warm, prominent coverage.",
