    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about the sale of Sioux land or the involvement of Little Crow. However, it fails to answer the question directly using internal knowledge or external grounding, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. The Gold Answer specifies Little Crow as the individual, but this fact is not addressed in the Model Answer."
