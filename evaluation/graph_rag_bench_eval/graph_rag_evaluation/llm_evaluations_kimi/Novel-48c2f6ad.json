    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about Portuguese or French actions affecting Mazagran and Mogador. However, it fails to answer the question using external knowledge, which is necessary since the Gold Answer provides the required information. The Model Answer is faithful to the context but does not address the core facts from the Gold Answer, resulting in low correctness and evidence coverage."
