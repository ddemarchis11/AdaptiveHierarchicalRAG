    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the context does not name any specific figure opposing the Ninety-Two Resolutions, which is accurate based on the retrieved context. However, the Gold Answer explicitly identifies Quesnel as the opponent, which the Model Answer fails to mention. Thus, the Model Answer is incorrect in terms of answering the question and does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer. It is faithful to the context, as the retrieved context does not provide information about Quesnel or opposition to the Ninety-Two Resolutions."
