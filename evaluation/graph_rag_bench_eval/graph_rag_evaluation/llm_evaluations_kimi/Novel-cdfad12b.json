  "gold_answer": "The kinnor, rendered as harp, is found in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript, showing a link from the Middle East (kinnor) to Europe (Anglo-Saxon manuscript).",
  "llm_answer": "The context does not provide information about triplets or their role in demonstrating the diffusion of harp-related musical practices from the Middle East into Europe.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about triplets or their role in the diffusion of harp-related musical practices. However, it fails to address the question using external knowledge or reasoning, which is necessary to align with the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer mentions the kinnor and its representation in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript, which is not covered by the Model Answer."
