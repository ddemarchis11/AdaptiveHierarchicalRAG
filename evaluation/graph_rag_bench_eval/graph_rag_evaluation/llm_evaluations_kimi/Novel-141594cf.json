  "question": "How does the narrative depict the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery, specifically through Blore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver and the process by which Major Tarver is ultimately accepted by Salome?",
  "gold_answer": "Major Tarver is shown being introduced by Blore and ultimately accepted by Salome, illustrating the process by which new individuals are incorporated into the group.",
  "llm_answer": "The passages do not show Blore actually ushering Major Tarver in, nor do they trace a step-by-step process of Tarver’s acceptance by Salome. All that can be said from the text is that Tarver eventually proposes to Salome and she is urged to accept him for his health’s sake, but the narrative itself does not depict the moment of, or reasons for, her final acceptance.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not explicitly show Blore ushering Major Tarver in or a detailed process of Tarver's acceptance by Salome. However, it misses the broader implication of the narrative's depiction of integration, as described in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not fully align with the Gold Answer's emphasis on the integration process and acceptance, leading to partial correctness and evidence coverage."
