    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about Asaph Hall protecting Wendell Phillips or demonstrating his commitment to the abolitionist cause. However, it fails to answer the question using external knowledge or internal understanding, which is necessary when the context is irrelevant. The Gold Answer explicitly states that Asaph Hall helped protect Wendell Phillips, but this fact is not addressed in the Model Answer."
