    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the cither, harpsichord, clavichord, spinet, and virginal as part of the Kensington museum's collection, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces additional instruments and cultural representations (Hindu and Chinese) that are not explicitly supported by the Retrieved Context in relation to the Kensington museum. While the context mentions these instruments and cultures, it does not confirm their presence in the museum's collection. This reduces faithfulness and evidence coverage, as the Model Answer goes beyond the scope of the Gold Answer and the directly supported facts."
