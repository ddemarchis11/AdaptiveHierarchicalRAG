    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly mentions Dr. Elsie Inglis's role in leading the Scottish Women’s Hospitals and their work in Serbia during the typhus epidemic, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it omits key details such as her travel to Serbia and the Serbian officers carrying her coffin after her death, which are central to the Gold Answer. The mention of the fountain at Mladenovatz is supported by the context but does not fully address the recognition described in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the claim about her work on the Rumanian-Russian front is not clearly supported by the retrieved context, reducing faithfulness."
