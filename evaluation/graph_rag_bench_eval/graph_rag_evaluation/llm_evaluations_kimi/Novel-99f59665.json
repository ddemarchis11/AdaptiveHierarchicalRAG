  "gold_answer": "The padres used a lasso, which caught a heathen; the heathen fled from the padres, who had a mission.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about padres, a lasso, or their mission, and therefore does not attempt to fabricate an answer.
