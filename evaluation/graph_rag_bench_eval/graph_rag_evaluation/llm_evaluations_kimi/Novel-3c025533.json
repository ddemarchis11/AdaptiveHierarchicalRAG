  "question": "In the context of surveying as discussed in the text, for what purpose is the determination of latitude needed?",
  "gold_answer": "Latitude is needed for determination of true meridian.",
  "llm_answer": "In the surveying context, latitude is needed to calculate the azimuth of Polaris, which in turn is used to establish a true meridian for accurate surveying.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 1.0,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly explains that latitude is needed to calculate the azimuth of Polaris, which is then used to establish a true meridian. This aligns with the Gold Answer and is supported by the Retrieved Context, which discusses the relationship between latitude, azimuth, and the determination of a true meridian. The Model Answer provides additional relevant details without contradicting the core truth of the Gold Answer."
