  "question": "Throughout Dragon's Blood, what does the recurring portrayal of Rudolph trembling in the presence of Heywood suggest about the nature of their interpersonal dynamic, and how does this reaction inform the reader about power relations or emotional tension between these two characters in various narrative situations?",
  "gold_answer": "Rudolph’s consistent trembling in Heywood’s presence suggests a persistent power imbalance or sense of intimidation, which frames the subsequent events across all chains.",
  "llm_answer": "The context does not contain any passages showing Rudolph “trembling” in Heywood’s presence, so it offers no basis for claiming such a recurring portrayal or for inferring a consistent power imbalance or emotional tension of that specific kind between them.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide evidence of Rudolph trembling in Heywood's presence, nor does it support the interpretation of a recurring portrayal of power imbalance or emotional tension based on trembling. However, the Model Answer fails to address the user's question directly or provide an alternative analysis grounded in the retrieved context or internal knowledge, resulting in a lack of correctness and evidence coverage."
