    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not explicitly mention Mr. Darbey's status as an officer of the Hussars or its relation to his interactions with The Dean and Sheba. However, it fails to address the question directly or provide any relevant information about the relationship between these elements, as outlined in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not contain the necessary facts or connections specified in the Gold Answer."
