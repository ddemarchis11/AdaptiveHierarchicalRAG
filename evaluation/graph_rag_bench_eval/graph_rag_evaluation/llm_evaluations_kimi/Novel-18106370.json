  "question": "In what way does the chain of relationships connect the poet Naso to Ceres?",
  "gold_answer": "Venus is goddess of Love, which Naso writes of, and Love inflamed Ceres.",
  "llm_answer": "The provided context does not mention the poet Naso or Ceres, so it cannot support an answer about any chain of relationships connecting them.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the retrieved context does not mention Naso or Ceres, which is correct. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or reasoning, even though the Gold Answer provides the necessary information. The Model Answer neither aligns with the Gold Answer nor retrieves or infers the required facts, resulting in a score of 0 across all metrics."
