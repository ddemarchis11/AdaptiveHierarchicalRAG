    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about the state where Mrs. Hall observed the eclipse. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge, which is that Mrs. Hall observed the eclipse in Colorado. Thus, the answer is incorrect and does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
