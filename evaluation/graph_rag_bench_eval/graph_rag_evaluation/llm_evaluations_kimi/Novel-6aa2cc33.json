  "question": "How does the narrative chain connect Cornwall's legendary expression to Arthur and his associates, particularly through Arthur's relationship with Sir Bedevere and the pivotal event of Excalibur being thrown away?",
  "gold_answer": "Cornwall is said to find its legendary expression in Arthur, who is connected to Sir Bedivere and pivotal events like the throwing of Excalibur, tying the region's narrative identity to Arthurian legend.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative links Cornwall’s legendary spirit to Arthur by portraying Sir Bedevere as the last faithful knight who, at Arthur’s dying command, throws Excalibur into Dozmare Pool; this act summons the boat of three queens that bears Arthur away to be healed, embodying the same “passionate personal fidelity” the narrator says still survives in Cornish nature.",
