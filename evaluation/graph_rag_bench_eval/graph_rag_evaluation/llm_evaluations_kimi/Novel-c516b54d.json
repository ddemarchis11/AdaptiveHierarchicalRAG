  "llm_answer": "The Anglo-Saxon manuscript shows David playing a triangular harp derived from the biblical kinnor, illustrating continuity between biblical and early medieval music. This depiction connects to ancient traditions where the lyre/harp was central to both Hebrew worship and European bardic practices. The manuscript thus visually documents how biblical musical instruments were adapted and reinterpreted in early Christian Europe.",
