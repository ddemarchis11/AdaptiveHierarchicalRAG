    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not specify where the Dean places the medicine chest. However, the Gold Answer explicitly states that the medicine chest is placed on the table, which the Model Answer fails to include. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect in terms of answering the question and does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
