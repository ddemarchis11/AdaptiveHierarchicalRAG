  "question": "From which state did General Pearce's army originate during the Civil War events described in the novel?",
  "gold_answer": "General Pearce had his army from Arkansas.",
  "llm_answer": "The context does not specify the state from which General Pearce's army originated.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not specify the state of origin for General Pearce's army, which is faithful to the provided context. However, it fails to answer the user's question, as the Gold Answer clearly states that General Pearce's army originated from Arkansas. The Model Answer does not include this key fact, resulting in low correctness and evidence coverage scores."
