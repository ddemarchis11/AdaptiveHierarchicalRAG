    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about the spine's composition or the characteristics of children's bones and growth. However, it fails to answer the user's question using internal knowledge, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. Thus, the answer is incorrect and lacks evidence coverage, but it is faithful to the context."
