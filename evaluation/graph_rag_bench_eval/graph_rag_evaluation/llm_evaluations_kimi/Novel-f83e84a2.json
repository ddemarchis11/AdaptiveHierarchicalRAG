    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not specify the professional association Elsie Maud Inglis wrote to, which is faithful to the context provided. However, it fails to answer the question correctly, as the Gold Answer specifies the Registered Medical Women's Association, which is not mentioned in the Model Answer. Additionally, the Model Answer does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
