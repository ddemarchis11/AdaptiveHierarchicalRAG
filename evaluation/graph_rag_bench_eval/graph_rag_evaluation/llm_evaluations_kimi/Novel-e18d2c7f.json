    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about the confrontation or Dr. O'Shaughnessy's interaction with Dennis Macarthy. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. Thus, the answer is incorrect in relation to the Gold Answer, and no evidence from the Gold Answer is covered."
