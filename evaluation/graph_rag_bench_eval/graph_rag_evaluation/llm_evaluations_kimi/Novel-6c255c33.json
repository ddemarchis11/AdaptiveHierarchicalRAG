    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the context does not specify any literary work read by C. A. S. Hall, which is incorrect as the Gold Answer clearly identifies 'Prometheus Bound' as the work she read. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it fails to address the Gold Answer and misses the key fact entirely."
