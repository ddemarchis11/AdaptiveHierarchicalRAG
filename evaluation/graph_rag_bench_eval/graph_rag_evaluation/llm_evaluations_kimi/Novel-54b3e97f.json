    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not mention Mr. Starling, who is explicitly identified in the Gold Answer as the individual who drank with Mr. Pepys during one of his social encounters. Instead, the Model Answer lists other individuals, none of whom are supported by the retrieved context as being relevant to the specific question. This makes the answer incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and lacking in evidence coverage."
