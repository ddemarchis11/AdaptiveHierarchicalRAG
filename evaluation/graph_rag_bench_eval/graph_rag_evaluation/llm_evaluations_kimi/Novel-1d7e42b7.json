  "question": "In 'Pen Pictures,' how is Cousin Cæsar's involvement both in military affairs and within his family relationships portrayed? Please include details about his close counsel with Cliff Carlo regarding legal matters, his service under General Price during the Civil War, and the circumstances in which he was ultimately left alone by Steve Brindle.",
  "gold_answer": "Cousin Cæsar was in close counsel with Cliff Carlo, served under Gen. Price, and was left alone by Steve Brindle.",
  "llm_answer": "Cousin Cæsar is shown as a man who mixes war and land-grabbing: he confers with Cliff Carlo about paying the legal costs of the Simon estate in Arkansas, insisting “I have made the cast, and will stand the hazard of the die,” while also serving in General Price’s Confederate force.  During Price’s September 1861 advance he marches north, helps capture Lexington, and later sees his old benefactor Steve Brindle fighting for the Union; yet Brindle, once Cæsar’s rescuer, now “did not know” him when Cæsar was surrounded by wealth, leaving Cæsar to face the campaign—and ultimately the battlefield—alone.",
