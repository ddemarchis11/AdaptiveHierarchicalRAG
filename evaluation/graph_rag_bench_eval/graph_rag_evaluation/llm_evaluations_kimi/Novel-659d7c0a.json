    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not mention the huehuetl and teponaztli, which are the specific instruments identified in the Gold Answer. Instead, it lists other instruments like pipes, flutes, whistles, rattles, and yotl, which are supported by the Retrieved Context but are not relevant to the User's Question or the Gold Answer. Thus, the Model Answer fails to address the core question correctly, even though it is faithful to the context provided."
