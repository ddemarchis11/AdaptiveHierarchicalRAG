    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about the treatment of the French language in law-courts or its status relative to English. However, it fails to answer the user's question using internal knowledge or reasoning, which is expected when the context is insufficient. The Gold Answer provides a clear response, but the Model Answer does not address the question directly, resulting in a score of 0 for correctness and evidence coverage."
