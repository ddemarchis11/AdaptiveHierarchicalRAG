  "question": "What evidence is there that the British Museum holds a significant collection of ancient musical instruments?",
  "gold_answer": "The British Museum has bells and cymbals, a fragment of a Greek lyre, an example of a tibia, and Anglo-Saxon trumpets may be seen in a manuscript of the eighth century in the British Museum.",
  "llm_answer": "The context does not provide direct evidence that the British Museum holds a significant collection of ancient musical instruments. It only mentions a seventh-century psalter in the British Museum that depicts King David playing the *rotta*, but it does not describe a broader collection of instruments.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide evidence of a significant collection of ancient musical instruments in the British Museum. However, it fails to address the Gold Answer, which lists specific items in the museum's collection, such as bells, cymbals, a Greek lyre fragment, a tibia, and Anglo-Saxon trumpets. The Model Answer does not align with the Gold Answer and misses the key facts entirely, resulting in low correctness and evidence coverage scores."
