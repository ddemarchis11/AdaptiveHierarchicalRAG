    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about who gave Cousin Cæsar his first lesson in the rewards of imagination. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge, which is expected when the context is insufficient. The Gold Answer specifies 'big-sis' as the person, but this fact is not addressed in the Model Answer."
