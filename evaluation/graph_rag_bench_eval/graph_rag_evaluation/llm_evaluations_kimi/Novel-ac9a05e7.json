  "gold_answer": "Tierra de Guerra is located between Guatemala, Tabasco, Chiapas and Yucatan.",

    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct geographical context for Tierra de Guerra as described in the Gold Answer. It does not mention the regions Guatemala, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Yucatan, nor does it provide any relevant information grounded in the retrieved context. The claim that the text does not give explicit boundaries is incorrect, as the Gold Answer clearly specifies them."
