  "question": "Imagine you are the Duke of Wellington. Write a diary entry about your efforts to emancipate the Catholics and your thoughts on the Irish and English relations.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today I continued my advocacy for Catholic emancipation. I am aware that the Catholics of this era know the necessity of modesty, especially considering their Irish heritage. There is a sentiment in high places that the Irish have been too lenient toward the English, and yet, England itself is a nation with a sense of common descent and unity. My hope is that these reforms will foster greater harmony across all these groups.",
  "llm_answer": "The provided context does not contain any information about the Duke of Wellington, Catholic emancipation, or his views on Irish and English relations. Therefore, I cannot write a diary entry from his perspective based on the given material.",
