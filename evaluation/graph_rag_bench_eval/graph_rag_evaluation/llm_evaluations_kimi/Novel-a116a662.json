    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about Mrs. Forrester's claim regarding her national background. However, it fails to answer the question directly using internal knowledge or external inference, which is necessary when the context is insufficient. The Gold Answer explicitly states that Mrs. Forrester claimed to be more French than English, which the Model Answer does not address."
