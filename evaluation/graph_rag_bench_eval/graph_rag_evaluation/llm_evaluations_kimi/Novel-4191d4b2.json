    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about Captain Balfour's visit to Toser or the presence of Moorish baths, making it faithful to the context. However, it fails to answer the question or align with the Gold Answer, which explicitly states that Captain Balfour visited Toser and mentions Moorish baths. Thus, the answer is incorrect and lacks evidence coverage."
