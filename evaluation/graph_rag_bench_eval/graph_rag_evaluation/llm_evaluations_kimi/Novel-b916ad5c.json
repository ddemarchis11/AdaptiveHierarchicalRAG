    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain relevant information to answer the question. However, it fails to provide the chain of evidence linking the kinnor to the British Museum's collection of cymbals, as stated in the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer specifies the connection through the Anglo-Saxon manuscript, which is not addressed by the Model Answer."
