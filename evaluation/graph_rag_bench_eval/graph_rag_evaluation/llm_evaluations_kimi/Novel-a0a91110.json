  "gold_answer": "The British Museum has cymbals used by Egyptian musicians; Assyrian musicians played the dulcimer, known as santir.",

  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not mention a relationship between the British Museum's cymbals and the santir. However, it fails to address the Gold Answer, which provides the relationship: Egyptian musicians used cymbals, and Assyrian musicians played the santir. The Model Answer does not contain this information, leading to a low score for correctness and evidence coverage."
