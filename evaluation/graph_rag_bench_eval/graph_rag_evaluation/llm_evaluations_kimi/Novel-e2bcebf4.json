    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies mice as the creatures eating food and does not mention star-nosed moles or their diet of nuts, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide information about star-nosed moles or their diet, making the Model Answer unfaithful to the context and failing to cover the key facts from the Gold Answer."
