  "gold_answer": "Angeline pleaded with Asaph Hall.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about Angeline Hall pleading to anyone during her difficult financial and personal period. However, the Gold Answer specifies that she pleaded with Asaph Hall, which is not addressed in the Model Answer. Thus, the Model Answer fails to contain the core meaning of the Gold Answer and does not cover the key fact mentioned."
