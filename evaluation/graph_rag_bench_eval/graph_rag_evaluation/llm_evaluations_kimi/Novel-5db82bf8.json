  "question": "Does the membership list of the Minnehaha Engine Company, as detailed in the early history of St. Paul's fire department, include Harry M. Shaw?",
  "gold_answer": "Yes, Harry M. Shaw is a member of the Minnehaha Engine Company.",
  "llm_answer": "The provided context does not include a membership list for the Minnehaha Engine Company, so it cannot confirm whether Harry M. Shaw was a member.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the context does not confirm Harry M. Shaw's membership in the Minnehaha Engine Company, which contradicts the Gold Answer that explicitly states he is a member. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it fails to provide the correct answer and misses the key fact from the Gold Answer."
