  "question": "Describe the reasoning path that links Mayab to the goddess Maia of Greece.",
  "gold_answer": "Mayab is a country of the Mayas, who are said to have originated from Mayab. Atlantis is the birthplace of Maia, a goddess in Greece.",
  "llm_answer": "The context states that in Greece the goddess Maia is “mentioned as that of a goddess … the mother of the gods: only we are told that she was the daughter of Atlantis—born of Atlantis,” and immediately adds that “if we come to the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a country called MAYAB.”  \nBecause Mayab is presented as the western counterpart to Atlantis, and Maia is explicitly called “the daughter of Atlantis,” the text implicitly equates Mayab with Atlantis and thus makes Maia a product of Mayab.",

    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly describes the reasoning path linking Mayab to the goddess Maia of Greece. It explains that Mayab is presented as the western counterpart to Atlantis, and since Maia is described as the daughter of Atlantis, the text implicitly equates Mayab with Atlantis, making Maia a product of Mayab. This reasoning is grounded in the retrieved context and includes all key facts from the Gold Answer."
