    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Suza Fairfield as the belle of Port William, raised and educated by Aunt Katy Demitt, and engaged to Don Carlo, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces additional details, such as Suza saving Don Carlo from the river and inheriting Aunt Katy's money and property, which are not explicitly supported by the retrieved context. While the core facts are correct, some claims lack grounding in the provided context, and the inheritance detail is not mentioned in the Gold Answer, leading to partial evidence coverage and faithfulness."
