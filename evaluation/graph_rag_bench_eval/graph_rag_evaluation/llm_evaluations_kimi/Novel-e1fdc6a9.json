  "question": "What is the status of Dimenet as described in the narrative's listing of towns within Morocco?",
  "gold_answer": "Dimenet is a town in Morocco.",
  "llm_answer": "The provided context does not mention a town named Dimenet, so its status in the narrative’s listing of Moroccan towns cannot be determined.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not mention Dimenet, which is faithful to the provided information. However, the Gold Answer explicitly states that Dimenet is a town in Morocco, and the Model Answer fails to address this fact, resulting in a lack of correctness and evidence coverage."
