    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain relevant information about the furnace, coke fire, or revivification process. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or reasoning, which would have been possible given the simplicity of the Gold Answer. The retrieved context is irrelevant, so faithfulness is rated as 0.0."
