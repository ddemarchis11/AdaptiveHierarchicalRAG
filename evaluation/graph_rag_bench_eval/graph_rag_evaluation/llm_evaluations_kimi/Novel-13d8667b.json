    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the context does not provide information about the treaty's conclusion, which is accurate based on the retrieved context. However, it fails to answer the user's question directly, which is clearly addressed in the Gold Answer ('No, the Moorish envoy was unable to conclude a treaty of peace with France'). The Model Answer does not contradict the context but does not provide the required information or align with the Gold Answer."
