    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies Captain Acker as the individual wounded at the Battle of Bull Run, whereas the Gold Answer specifies Constant Woodward. The retrieved context supports the Gold Answer, mentioning Constant Woodward being wounded at Bull Run, but does not support the claim about Captain Acker in relation to Angeline Hall. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and fails to cover the key facts."
