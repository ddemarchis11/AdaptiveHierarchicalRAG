    "explanation": "The Model Answer identifies the fiddle-bow as being used with the Welsh crwth, which is a stringed instrument resembling a fiddle. However, the Gold Answer specifies the fiddle itself as the instrument played with a fiddle-bow, and the context does not explicitly support the claim about the crwth being played with a fiddle-bow. Thus, the answer is partially correct but not faithful to the retrieved context, and it misses the central factual point about the fiddle."
