    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not specify who created illustrations for the German edition of 'Tristram Shandy'. However, the Gold Answer explicitly identifies J. F. Schröter as the illustrator, which the Model Answer fails to include. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not answer the question correctly or cover the key fact provided in the Gold Answer."
