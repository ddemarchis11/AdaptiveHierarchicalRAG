  "question": "Imagine you are Young Simon. Write a diary entry about your family connections and your feelings about the events involving your cousin Cæsar and Roxie.",
  "gold_answer": "As the only son of S. S. Simon, I often hear stories about our family. My cousin, Cæsar, has been at the center of recent events, from delivering a note to the Governor to helping Simon learn about Roxie's family. I hear Roxie has been charged, and I worry for her. Our family feels so interconnected, especially with big-sis raising Cæsar and our ties to the Carlow and Brindle families.",
  "llm_answer": "April 7, 1861 – Chicago  \nDiary of Young Simon  \n\nCousin Cæsar has just carried me from the cars to the hotel; I can no longer stand. He tells me the physicians warned that the journey would drain the last of my strength, yet I had to reach Roxie before the spring slipped away.  \n\nI am the nephew of the late S. S. Simon of Arkansas, heir to the great cotton estate he left unclaimed; Cæsar, my cousin, raised me on the story and steered me toward Roxie once he learned she is Fairfield’s daughter and a co-heir. I loved her the moment I saw her aboard the boat, and when I felt death pressing close I sent for Governor Morock and made my will, giving every acre and dollar to Roxie. Cæsar witnessed it all; I saw astonishment in his eyes, but he held his tongue.  \n\nMy heart is quiet now: the fortune will pass to the woman who agreed to wed a dying man, and my father’s name will rest beside me in Arkansas soil.",
