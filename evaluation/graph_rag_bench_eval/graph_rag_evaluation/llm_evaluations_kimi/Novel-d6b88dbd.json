    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the context does not identify the member who voted against the Ninety-Two Resolutions, which is factually incorrect as the Gold Answer specifies Augustin Cuvillier. While the retrieved context does not explicitly mention Cuvillier's vote, the Model Answer fails to provide the correct information from internal knowledge, leading to a score of 0.0 for correctness and evidence coverage. However, the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, as it accurately reflects the lack of relevant information in the provided excerpts."
