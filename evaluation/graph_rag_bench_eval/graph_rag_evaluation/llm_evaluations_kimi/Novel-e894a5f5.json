    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question directly, as it does not confirm the geographical relationship between the Devil's Frying-pan and Cadgwith, which is stated in the Gold Answer as 'near Cadgwith.' While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it does not provide the required information or evidence to support the Gold Answer."
