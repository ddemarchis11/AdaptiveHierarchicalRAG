    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that El-Kesar is located in the region of Tafilett, whereas the Gold Answer specifies that El-Kesar is in Gharb. The retrieved context does not provide any information to support the claim that El-Kesar is in Tafilett, making the answer both incorrect and unfaithful to the context. Additionally, the Model Answer fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
