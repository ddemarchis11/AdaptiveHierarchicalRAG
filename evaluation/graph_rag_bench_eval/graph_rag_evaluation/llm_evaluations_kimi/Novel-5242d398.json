  "question": "Imagine you are the spine. Write a diary entry about how you help the body move and grow, especially in children.",
  "gold_answer": "Dear Diary, As the spine, I form the backbone of the chest and keep everything upright. I'm made of bones, and in children, those bones bend easily as they grow. I work closely with muscles and help support the lungs and heart inside the chest, which is made up of the spine, ribs, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones. It's a big responsibility, but I like helping children grow tall and strong!",
  "llm_answer": "Dear Diary,  \nToday I held up my person’s head and chest again, made of twenty-four little bones with springy gristle cushions between them so every bend, hop, and twist feels smooth instead of jolting. Because my child is still young, my bones are soft and bendy, so I reminded them to sit and stand straight—if they slump too long, I could grow crooked and crowd the lungs. I love watching them grow taller each night while they sleep, knowing that as long as they’re careful, I’ll keep them strong, straight, and ready for tomorrow’s running and climbing.",
