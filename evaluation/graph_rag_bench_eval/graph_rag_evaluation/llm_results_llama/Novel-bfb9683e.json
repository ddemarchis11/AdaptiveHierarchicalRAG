A man who never drinks liquor will get well, where a drinking man would surely die. TOBACCO AND THE NERVES. Why does any one wish to use tobacco? Because many men say that it helps them, and makes them feel better. Shall I tell you how it makes them feel better? If a man is cold, the tobacco deadens his nerves so that he does not feel the cold and does not take pains to make himself warmer. If a man is tired, or in trouble, tobacco will not really rest him or help him out of his trouble. It only puts his nerves to sleep and helps him think that he is not tired, and that he does not need to overcome his troubles. It puts his nerves to sleep very much as alcohol does, and helps him to be contented with what ought not to content him. A boy who smokes or chews tobacco, is not so good a scholar as if he did not use the poison. He can not remember his lessons so well. Usually, too, he is not so polite, nor so good a boy",

You have learned about the twenty-four little bones in the spine, and the ribs that curve around from the spine to the front, or breast-bone. These bones, with the shoulder-blades and the collar-bones, form a bony case or box. In it are some of the most useful organs of the body. This box is divided across the middle by a strong muscle, so that we may say it is two stories high. The upper room is called the chest; the lower one, the abdomen ([)a]b d[=o]'m[)e]n). In the chest, are the heart and the lungs. In the abdomen, are the stomach, the liver, and some other organs. THE STOMACH. The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful a bag as could be made, you will say, when I tell you what it can do. The outside is made of muscles; the lining prepares a juice called gastric (g[)a]s'tr[)i]k) juice, and keeps it always ready for use.

A large part of your body is made of water. So you need, of course, to drink water, and to have it used in preparing your food. Water comes from the clouds, and is stored up in cisterns or in springs in the ground. From these pipes are laid to lead the water to our houses. Sometimes, men dig down until they reach a spring, and so make a well from which they can pump the water, or dip it out with a bucket. Water that has been standing in lead pipes, may have some of the lead mixed with it. Such water would be very likely to poison you, if you drank it. Impurities are almost sure to soak into a well if it is near a drain or a stable. If you drink the water from such a well, you may be made very sick by it. It is better to go thirsty,",

If the doctor had put in more alcohol, day after day, as one does who drinks liquor, sores would perhaps have come on the delicate lining of the stomach. Sometimes the stomach is so hurt by alcohol, that the drinker dies. If the stomach can not do its work well, the whole body must suffer from want of the good food it needs.[C] TOBACCO AND THE MOUTH. The saliva in the mouth helps to prepare the food, before it goes into the stomach. Tobacco makes the mouth very dry, and more saliva has to flow out to moisten it. But tobacco juice is mixed with the saliva, and that must not be swallowed. It must be spit out, and with it is sent the saliva that was needed to help prepare the food. Tobacco discolors the teeth, makes bad sores in the mouth, and often causes a disease of the throat. You can tell where some people have been, by the neatness and comfort they leave after them. You can tell where the tobacco-user has been, by the dirty floor, and street, and the air made unfit to breathe, because of the smoke and strong, bad smell of old tobacco from his pipe and cigar and from his breath and clothes.
