To Mr. Clayton's consternation, however, Mr. Pinero announced that he was dissatisfied with his work, and proposed to begin an entirely new play, as he had a more promising idea. But time was pressing, and a successor to \"The Schoolmistress\" was an immediate necessity. However, Mr. Pinero's idea of writing a play round a dean, who, while being a paragon of dignity and decorum, should be driven by an indiscreet act into a most undignified dilemma, appealed to Mr. Clayton, and hastening back to London with the sketches for the requisite scenes, he left Mr. Pinero to set to work at once upon the new scheme. And within a few weeks, indeed by the time the scenery was ready, the new play was completed, the rural constable of a village adjacent to Brighton having suggested the character of Noah Topping. \"Dandy Dick\" was produced at the Court Theatre on January 27th, 1887, and, meeting with a most favorable",

But a kind of melancholy interest attaches to \"Dandy Dick,\" for this play was, as it were, the swan-song of the old theatre and of the Clayton and Cecil partnership; and it was the piece in which Mr. Clayton was acting when death overtook him, to the general grief. The production of \"Dandy Dick\" may be considered as something of a _tour de force_ in its way. \"The Schoolmistress\" was at the",

To Gallegher the incandescent lights began to whirl about in circles, and to burn in different colors; the faces of the reporters kneeling before him and chafing his hands and feet grew dim and unfamiliar, and the roar and rumble of the great presses in the basement sounded far away, like the murmur of the sea. And then the place and the circumstances of it came back to him again sharply and with sudden vividness. Gallegher looked up, with a faint smile, into the managing editor's face. \"You won't turn me off for running away, will you?\" he whispered. The managing editor did not answer immediately. His head was bent, and he was thinking, for some reason or other, of a little boy of his own, at home in bed. Then he said, quietly, \"Not this time, Gallegher.\" Gallegher's head sank back comfortably on the older man's shoulder, and he smiled comprehensively at the faces of the young men crowded around him. \"You hadn't ought to,\" he said, with a touch of his old impudence, \"'cause--I beat the town.\" A WALK UP THE AVENUE He came down the steps slowly, and pulling mechanically at his",
