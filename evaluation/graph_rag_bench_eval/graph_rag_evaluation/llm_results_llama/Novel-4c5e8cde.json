She lifted up her arms with childlike simplicity and backed toward him as he stepped behind her, drew in the folds, and pinned them around what proved a very small waist indeed. Then he untied the apron, took it off, folded it in half, and retied its curtailed proportions around the waist. \"It does feel a heap easier,\" she said, with a little shiver of satisfaction, as she lifted her round cheek, and the tail of her blue eyes with their brown lashes, over her shoulder. It was a tempting moment--but Jack felt that the whole race of gold hunters was on trial just then, and was adamant! Perhaps he was a gentle fellow at heart, too. \"I could loop up that dress also, if I had more pins,\" he remarked tentatively. Jack had sisters of his own. The pins were forthcoming.

It was her mustang he was ridin' when the row happened near her house.\" \"Well?\" said the editor, with disconcerting placidity. \"Well,\"--hesitated the foreman, \"you see, they're a bad lot, those Greasers, especially the Ramierez, her husband.\" The editor knew that the foreman was only echoing the provincial prejudice against this race, which he himself had always combated. Ramierez kept a fonda or hostelry on a small estate,--the last of many leagues formerly owned by the Spanish grantee, his landlord,--and had a wife of some small coquetries and redundant charms. Gambling took place at the fonda, and it was said the common prejudice against the Mexican did not, however, prevent the American from trying to win his money. \"Then you think Ramierez was jealous of the colonel?

PART II Mr. Jack Fleming was indeed \"not much of a miner.\" He and his partners--both as young, hopeful, and inefficient as himself--had for three months worked a claim in a mountain mining settlement which yielded them a certain amount of healthy exercise, good-humored grumbling, and exalted independence. To dig for three or four hours in the morning, smoke their pipes under a redwood-tree for an hour at noon, take up their labors again until sunset, when they \"washed up\" and gathered sufficient gold to pay for their daily wants, was, without their seeking it, or even knowing it, the realization of a charming socialistic ideal which better men than themselves had only dreamed of. Fleming fell back into this refined barbarism, giving little thought to his woodland experience, and no revelation of it to his partners. He had transacted their business at the mining town.
