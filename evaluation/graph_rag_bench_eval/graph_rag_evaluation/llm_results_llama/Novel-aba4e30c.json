She looked young again,--the spirit of youth, of knowledge, of wonderful brightness and unbelief. \"Must we take it so very, very hard?\" she coaxed. \"Isn't it just a place to be happy in?\" As through a tumult he heard, and recognized the wisdom of the ages. \"Because,\" she added, \"it lasts such a little while--\" On the rail their hands suddenly touched.

He had seen quickly, guessed with a diabolic shrewdness, yet would remain on the surface, always, of a mystery so violent and so profound. The young man stalked into his vacant nunnery in a rage, a dismal pomp of emotion: reason telling him that a friend had spoken sense, imagination clothing him in the sceptred pall of tragedy. Yet one of these unwelcome words had stuck: he was Werther, it was true--a man who came too late. Another word was soon fulfilled; for the hot weather came, sudden, tropical, ferocious. Without gradation, the vernal days and languid noons were gone in a twinkling. The change came like another act of a play. One morning--though the dawn stirred cool and fragrant as all dawns before--the \"boy\" laid out Rudolph's white tunic, slipped in the shining buttons, smeared pipe-clay on his heaviest helmet; and Rudolph, looking from his window, saw that on the river, by the same instinct, boatmen were stretching up their bamboo awnings.

When breath failed, he staggered, gasping, and swept his audience with the glazed, unmeaning stare of drink or lunacy. The merchant spoke up, timid and deprecating. As though the words were vitriol, the other started, whirled face to face, and was seized with a new raving. Something protruded at his waistband, like a rudimentary, Darwinian stump.

His guide halted, peered shrewdly, and listened. \"No, they are still shooting,\" he answered, and limped onward, skirting the uproar.
