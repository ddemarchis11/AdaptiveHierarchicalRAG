  "llm_answer": "The narrative connects the names of Egypt, Tyre, and Khati (the Hittites) to etymological roots in the Maya language by suggesting that these names have similar meanings and origins in the Maya language. For example, the name \"Tyre\" is derived from the Maya word \"Tzur\", meaning a promontory or a number of villages, and \"Tzucub\", a province. The name \"Khati\" is derived from the Maya verb \"KAT\" or \"KATAH\", meaning to place impediments on the road, to come forth and obstruct the passage. Additionally, the name \"Canaan\" is derived from the Maya word \"Kanaan\", meaning to be tired, to be fatigued, or abundance.",

I can only surmise that they so called it from the great absorbant[TN-8] quality of its stony soil, which, in an incredibly short time, absorbs the water at the surface. This percolating through the pores of the stone is afterward found filtered clear and cool in the senotes and caves. _Mayab_, in the Maya language, means a tammy, a sieve. From the name of the country, no doubt, the Mayas took their name, as natural; and that name is found, as that of the English to-day, all over the ancient civilized world. When, on January 28, 1873, I had the honor of reading a paper before the New York American Geographical Society--on the coincidences that exist between the monuments, customs, religious rites, etc. of the prehistoric inhabitants of America and those of Asia and Egypt--I pointed to the fact that sun circles, dolmen and tumuli, similar to the megalithic monuments of America, had been found to exist scattered through the islands of the Pacific to Hindostan; over the plains of the peninsulas at the south of Asia, through the deserts of Arabia, to the northern parts of",

Some historians having pretended that they were a Scythian tribe, derived it from Scythia; but I think that we may find it very natural, as that of their principal cities, in the Maya language. All admit that the Khati, until the time when they were vanquished by Rameses the Great, as recorded on the walls of his palace at Thebes, the _Memnonium_, always placed obstacles on the way of the Egyptians and opposed them. According to the Maya, their name is significative of these facts, since KAT or KATAH is a verb that means to place impediments on the road, to come forth and obstruct the passage. _Carchemish_ was their great emporium, where merchants from afar congregated; it was consequently a city of merchants. CAH means a city, and _Chemul_ is navigator. _Carchemish_ would then be _cah-chemul_, the city of navigators, of merchants. KATISH, their sacred city, would be the city where sacrifices are offered.
