  "gold_answer": "Chaacmol had a funeral chamber at Chichen, was studied by Augustus Le Plongeon, and was killed by Aac.",
  "llm_answer": "Chaacmol is considered a culture hero in Maya history, as evidenced by the mural paintings and sculptures at Chichen-Itza, which depict his life and the customs of his contemporaries. His funeral chamber at Chichen is a significant archaeological find, and the research conducted by Augustus Le Plongeon has shed light on his importance in Maya mythology.",

By placing in the mouth of the dying martyr these words: _My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?_ they have done him an injustice, presenting him in his last moments despairing and cowardly, traits so foreign to his life, to his teachings, to the resignation shown by him during his trial, and to the fortitude displayed by him in his last journey to Calvary; more than all,",

The meaning of the red hand used by the aborigines of some parts of America has been, it is well known, a subject of discussion for learned men and scientific societies. Its uses as a symbol remained for a long time a matter of conjecture. It seems that Mr. Schoolcraft had truly arrived at the knowledge of its veritable meaning. Effectively, in the 2d column of the 5th page of the _New York Herald_ for April 12, 1879, in the account of the visit paid by Gen.

Effectively, _Osiris_ and _Isis_ are considered as king and queen of the Amenti--the region of the West--the mansion of the dead, of the ancestors. Whatever may be the etymology of the name of Osiris, it is a _fact_, that in the sculptures he is often represented with a spotted skin suspended near him, and Diodorus Siculus says: \"That the skin is usually represented without the head; but some instances where this is introduced show it to be the _leopard's_ or _panther's_.\" Again, the name of Osiris as king of the West, of the Amenti, is always written, in hieroglyphic characters, representing a crouching _leopard_ with an eye above it. It is also well known that the priests of Osiris wore a _leopard_ skin as their ceremonial dress. Now, Chaacmol reigned with his sister Moo, at Chichen-Itza, in Mayab, in the land of the West for Egypt. The name _Chaacmol_ means, in Maya, a",

Mrs. Le Plongeon still preserves some in her possession. From where they procured it is more than we can tell at present.
