  "llm_answer": "During their time together at the Flowery Pagoda, the relationship between Rudolph and Mrs. Forrester developed from a sense of mutual understanding and shared experiences, to a deeper emotional connection.

I mean, we can't carry these long faces to the club, can we? Ladies' Night--what larks!\" He caught up his cap, with a grimace. \"The Lord loveth a cheerful liar. Come ahead!\" On the way, he craned from his chair to shout, in the darkness:-- \"I say! If you can do a turn of any sort, let the women have it. All the fun they get. Be an ass, like the rest of us. Maskee how silly! Mind you, it's all hands, these concerts!\" No music, but the click of ivory and murmur of voices came down the stairway of the club.

Whatever he said, they forgot their game, and circled the table to listen. He spoke earnestly, his hands fluttering in nervous gestures. \"Something's up,\" grumbled Heywood, \"when the doctor forgets to pose.\" Behind Chantel, as he wheeled, heaved the gray bullet-head and sturdy shoulders of Gilly. \"Alone?\" called the padre. \"Why, where's the Mem?\" He came up with evident weariness, but replied cheerfully:-- \"She's very sorry, and sent chin-chins all round. But to-night--Her journey, you know. She's resting.--I hope we've not delayed the concert?\" \"Last man starts it!\" Heywood sprang up, flung open a battered piano, and dragged Chantel to the stool. \"Come, Gilly, your forfeit!\" The elder man blushed, and coughed. \"Why, really,\" he stammered. \"Really, if you wish me to!\" Heywood slid back into his chair, grinning.",

Don't you think you have a better?\" Rudolph stared. \"Oh, you funny, funny boy!\" she cried, with a bewildering laugh, of delight and pride. \"I hate people all prim and circumspect, and you--You'd have flown back there straight at him, before my--before all the others.

Makers of rice-wine, said Heywood; as he strode along explaining, he threw off his surly fit.
