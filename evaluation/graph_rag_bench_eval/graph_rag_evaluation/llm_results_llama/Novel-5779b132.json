This juice is mostly water, sweetened with a sugar of its own. It is flavored with something which makes us know, the moment we taste it, that it is grape-juice, and not cherry-juice or plum-juice. Apples also contain water, sugar, and apple flavor; and cherries contain water, sugar, and cherry flavor. The same is true of other fruits. They all, when ripe, have the water and the sugar; and each has a flavor of its own. Ripe grapes are sometimes gathered and put into great tubs called vats. In these the juice is squeezed out. In some countries, this squeezing is done by bare-footed men who jump into the vats and press the grapes with their feet. The grape-juice is then drawn off from the skins and seeds and left standing in a warm place. Bubbles soon begin to rise and cover the top of it with froth. The juice is all in motion. [Illustration: _Picking grapes and making wine._] If the cook had wished to use this grape-juice to make jelly, she would say: \"Now, I can not make my grape-jelly, for the grape-juice is spoiled.\" WHAT",

Here, again, it is the earth that sends us our food. Fat meat comes from animals well fed on grain and grass; sugar, from sugar-cane, maple-trees, or beets; oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and starch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and other grains. Green apples and other unripe fruits are not yet ready to be eaten. The starch which we take for food has to be changed into sugar, before it can mix with the blood and help feed the body. As the sun ripens fruit, it changes its starch to sugar. You can tell this by the difference in the taste of ripe and unripe apples. CANDY.

She had to lie in bed for many weeks. Before her sickness she had plenty of stout muscles in her arms and legs and was running about the house from morning till night, carrying her big doll in her arms.

The sugar in the grape-juice is changing into something else. It is turning into alcohol and a gas[A] that moves about in little bubbles in the liquid, and rising to the top, goes off into the air. The alcohol is a thin liquid which, mixed with the water, remains in the grape-juice. The sugar is gone; alcohol and the bubbles of gas are left in its place. This alcohol is a liquid poison. A little of it will harm any one who drinks it; much of it would kill the drinker. Ripe grapes are good food; but grape-juice, when its sugar has turned to alcohol, is not a safe drink for any one. It is poisoned by the alcohol. WINE. This changed grape-juice is called wine. It is partly water, partly alcohol, and it still has the grape flavor in it. Wine is also made from currants, elderberries, and other fruits, in very much the same way as from grapes. People sometimes make it at home from the fruits that grow in their own gardens, and think there is no alcohol in it, because they do not put any in.
