Your mamma tells you sometimes at breakfast that you must eat oat-meal and milk to make you grow into a big man or woman. Did you ever wonder what part of you is made of oat-meal, or what part of milk? That stout little arm does not look like oat-meal; those rosy cheeks do not look like milk. If our food is to make stout arms and rosy cheeks, strong bodies and busy brains, it must first be changed into a form in which it can get to each part and feed it.

It was years ago, but the tree-toad is there still, looking just as it did the first day it was put in. What has kept it so? It is the alcohol.

The sugar in the grape-juice is changing into something else. It is turning into alcohol and a gas[A] that moves about in little bubbles in the liquid, and rising to the top, goes off into the air. The alcohol is a thin liquid which, mixed with the water, remains in the grape-juice. The sugar is gone; alcohol and the bubbles of gas are left in its place. This alcohol is a liquid poison. A little of it will harm any one who drinks it; much of it would kill the drinker. Ripe grapes are good food; but grape-juice, when its sugar has turned to alcohol, is not a safe drink for any one. It is poisoned by the alcohol. WINE. This changed grape-juice is called wine. It is partly water, partly alcohol, and it still has the grape flavor in it. Wine is also made from currants, elderberries, and other fruits, in very much the same way as from grapes.

The teeth must first do their work faithfully. The stomach must have rest, too. I have seen some children who want to make their poor stomachs work all the time. They are always eating apples, or candy, or something, so that their stomachs have no chance to rest. If the stomach does not rest, it will wear out the same as a machine would. The stomach can not work well, unless it is quite warm. If a person pours ice-water into his stomach as he eats, just as the food is beginning to change into the gray fluid of which you have learned, the work stops until the stomach gets warm again.
