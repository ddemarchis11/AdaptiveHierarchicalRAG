A slight premonition of disappointment followed; a rich indication would have shown itself before this! A few more workings, and the pan was quite empty except for a few pin-points of \"color,\" almost exactly the quantity he found before. He washed another pan with the same result.

For an instant he thought of running after her with a word of caution; but on reflection he saw that this might awaken her suspicion and precipitate a discovery by another. His only safety for the present was silence, until he could repeat his experiment. And that must be done quickly. How should he get away without his partners' knowledge of his purpose?

Her greenish gray eyes, in which too much of the white was visible, had, he fancied, a singular similarity of expression to Cota's own! Utterly confounded, and staring at the girl in her white, many flounced frock, bare head, and tawny braids, as she stood beside this incarnation of equine barbarism, Grey could remember nothing like it outside of a circus. He stammered a few words of admiration of the mare. Miss Cota threw out her two arms with a graceful gesture and a profound curtsey, and said-- \"A la disposicion de le Usted, senor.\" Grey was quick to understand the malicious mischief which underlay this formal curtsey and danced in the girl's eyes, and even fancied it shared by the animal itself.
