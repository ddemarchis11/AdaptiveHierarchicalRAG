Some of your joints work like the hinges of a door, and these are called hinge-joints. You can find them in your elbows, knees, fingers, and toes. How many hinge-joints can you find? Think how many hinges must be used by the boy who takes off his hat and makes a polite bow to his teacher, when she meets him on the street. How many hinges do you use in running up-stairs, opening the door, buttoning your coat or your boots, playing ball or digging in your garden? You see that we use these hinges nearly all the time. We could not do without them. BALL AND SOCKET JOINTS. All our joints are not hinge-joints. Your shoulder has a joint that lets your arm swing round and round, as well as move up and down. Your hip has another that lets your leg move in much the same way. [Illustration: _The hip-joint._] This kind of joint is the round end or ball of a long bone, which moves in a hole, called a socket. Your joints do not creak or get out of order, as those of doors and gates sometimes do. A soft, smooth fluid, much like the white of an egg, keeps them moist and makes them work easily.",

The object of all this legislation is, not that the future citizen may know the technical names of bones, nerves, and muscles, but that he may have a _=timely=_ and _=forewarning=_ knowledge of the effects of alcohol and other popular poisons upon the human body, and therefore upon life and character. With every reason in favor of such education, and the law requiring it, its practical tests in the school-room will result in failure, unless there shall be ready for teacher and scholar, a well-arranged, simple, and practical book, bringing these truths down to the capacity of the child. A few years hence, when the results of this study in our Normal Schools shall be realized in the preparation of the teacher, we can depend upon her adapting oral lessons from advanced works on this theme, but now, the average primary teacher brings to this study no experience, and limited previous study. To meet this need, this work has been prepared.
