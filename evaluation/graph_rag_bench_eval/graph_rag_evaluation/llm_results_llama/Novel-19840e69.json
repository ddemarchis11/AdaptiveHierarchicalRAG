The singularity of this sacred village is, that Jews constitute the majority of the population. But they seem absolutely necessary to the very existence of the Mussulmen of North Africa, who cannot live without them, or make profitable exchange of the products of the soil, or of native industry, for European articles of use and luxury. Shtouka, or Stuka, is, according to some, a large town or village; or, as stated by Davidson, a _district_. The fact is, many African districts are called by the name of a principal town or village in them, and _vice versa_. This place stands on the banks of the Wad-el-Mesah, and is inhabited by some fifteen hundred Shelouhs, who are governed by a Sheikh, nearly independent of Morocco. On Talent and Shtouka, Mr. Davidson remarks. \"There is no town called Stuka; it is a district; none that I can find called Talent; there is Tilin.

Wind instruments of the organ kind,--_i.e._, such as are constructed of a number of tubes which can be sounded together by means of a common mouthpiece or some similar contrivance, and upon which therefore chords and combinations of chords, or harmony, can be produced,--are comparatively of rare occurrence. Some interesting specimens of them exist in China, Japan, Laos, and Siam. Besides these various kinds of sound-producing means employed in musical performances, a few others less widely diffused could be pointed out, which are of a construction not represented in any of our well-known European specimens. For instance, some nations have peculiar instruments of friction, which can hardly be classed with our instruments of percussion. Again, there are contrivances in which a number of strings are caused to vibrate by a current of air, much as is the case with the Æolian harp; which might with equal propriety be considered either as stringed instruments or as wind instruments.

Let us not laugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still prevails in Europe. On many of the French and German soldiers, killed during the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of paper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic words or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be possessed of the power of making him invulnerable. I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by wearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the Pope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and other misfortunes to which human flesh is heir. That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did not receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational conclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS. If we had nothing but their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its etymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.

North Africa is wonderfully homogeneous in the matter of religion. The people, indeed, have but one religion. Even the extraneous Judaism is the same in its Deism--depression of the female--circumcision and many of the religious customs, festivals and traditions.

Another and most singular name was also given to these Arab warriors in France and other parts of Europe--that of Saracens--whose etymology is extremely obscure. [13] From this time the Spaniards have always given the names of Moors (_los Moros_), not only to the Arabs of Spain, but to all the Arabs; and, confounding farther these two denominations, they have bestowed the name of _Moros_ upon the Arabs of Morocco and those in the environs of Senegal. The Arabs who invaded Northern Africa about 650, were all natives of Asia, belonging to various provinces of Arabia, and were divided into Ismaelites, Amalekites, Koushites, &c. They were all warriors; and it is considered a title of nobility to have belonged to their first irruption of the enthusiastic sons of the Prophet. A second invasion took place towards the end of the ninth century--an epoch full of wars--during which, the Caliph Kaim transported the seat of his government from Kairwan to Cairo, ending",

Indeed, it was two years before he fully recovered. Strange that historians of the Civil War have not dwelt upon the enormous advantage to the Confederates afforded by their hot, enervating climate, so deadly to the Northern volunteer. In January, 1863, the Halls and Warners moved to a house in Washington, on I Street, between 20th and 21st Streets, N.W. Here a third surgical operation on the wounded colonel proved successful. Though he nearly bled to death, the distorted bullet was at last pulled out through the hole it had made in the flat part of the hip bone. Deceived by the doctors before, the poor man cried: “Mr. Hall, is the ball out? Is the ball out?” Soon after this, in March, small-pox, which was prevalent in the city, broke out in the house, and Mr. Hall sent his wife and little boy to Cambridge, Mass.

IXTAL would, therefore, be she who desires to satisfy a corporal inclination. As to her other name, _Nana_, it simply means the great mother, the very mother. If from the names of god and goddesses, we pass to that of places, we will find that the Maya language also furnishes a perfect etymology for them.
