  "question": "How does the narrative reveal the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters, specifically through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname George Tidd and Augustin's role as the Dean, and what impact does this have on the unfolding of their personal and social identities?",
  "gold_answer": "Georgiana Tidman uses the nickname George Tidd, and Augustin is also known as the Dean, showing the use of alternate identities among the characters.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative reveals the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" and Augustin's role as the Dean. This is evident when Georgiana refers to herself as \"George Tidd\" and when Augustin is addressed as \"Dean\" by others. This use of nicknames and alternate identities suggests that the characters are trying to conceal or present themselves in a particular way, which has an impact on the unfolding of their personal and social identities.",
