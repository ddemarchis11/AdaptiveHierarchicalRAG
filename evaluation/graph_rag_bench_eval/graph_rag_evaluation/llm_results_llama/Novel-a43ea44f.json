Somewhere in the dark maze, the chairs halted, under a portal black and heavy as a Gate of Dreams. And as by the anachronism of dreams there hung, among its tortuous symbols, the small, familiar placard--\"Fliegelman and Sons, Office.\" Heywood led the way, past two ducking Chinese clerks, into a sombre room, stone-floored, furnished stiffly with a row of carved chairs against the wall, lighted coldly by roof-windows of placuna, and a lamp smoking before some commercial god in his ebony and tinsel shrine. \"There,\" he said, bringing Rudolph to an inner chamber, or dark little pent-house, where another draughty lamp flickered on a European desk. \"Here's your cell. I'm off--call for you later. Good luck!\"--Wheeling in the doorway, he tossed a book, negligently.--\"Caught! You may as well start in, eh?--'Cantonese Made Worse,'\" To his departing steps Rudolph listened as a prisoner, condemned, might listen to the last of all earthly visitors. Peering through a kind of butler's window, he saw beyond the shrine his two pallid subordinates, like mystic automatons, nodding and smoking by the doorway.

He had sunk in mystery, to become at one forever with the drunken cormorant-fisher. Obscene delight raged in the crowded boat, with yells and laughter, and flourish of bamboo poles. \"Come away from the window,\" said Heywood; and then to the white-haired doctor: \"Your question's answered, padre. Strange, to come so quick.\" He jerked his thumb back toward the river. \"And that's only first blood.\" The others had broken into wrangling. \"Escaped?

He found himself jogging in a rickshaw, while equatorial rain beat like down-pouring bullets on the tarpaulin hood, and sluiced the Chinaman's oily yellow back.

It was the last night out from Singapore. That veiled brightness, as they leaned on the rail, showed her brown hair fluttering dimly, her face pale, half real, half magical, her eyes dark and undefined pools of mystery. It was late; they had been silent for a long time; and Rudolph felt that something beyond the territory of words remained to be said, and that the one brilliant epoch of his life now drew madly to a close. \"What do you think of it all?\" the woman asked suddenly, gravely, as though they had been isolated together in the deep spaces of the same thought. \"I do not yet--Of what?\" rejoined Rudolph, at a loss. \"Of all this.\" She waved an eloquent little gesture toward the azure-lighted gulf. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Of the world?\" \"Yes,\" she answered slowly. \"The world.

And he had given all this up, and for what, he asked himself, and why? He could not answer that now. It was simply because he had been surfeited with too much content, he replied, passionately.

His legs ached and twitched, the bones of his neck were stretched as if to break, and a corner of broken clay bored sharply between his ribs. He felt no fear, however: only a great impatience to have the spy begin,--rise, beckon, call to his fellows, fire his gun, hit or miss. This longing, or a flash of anger, or the rice-brandy working so nimbly in his wits, gave him both impulse and plan. \"Don't move,\" he whispered; \"wait here.\" And wriggling backward, inch by inch, feet foremost among the crowded bellies of the jars, he gained the further darkness.

It was only the halting, rusty fashion of the speech that finally fretted him into listening. The words did not concern him. \"Are you dead, then?\" grumbled the coolie. \"Did she kill you?\" Rudolph dismissed him with a vague but angry motion. Some time afterward the same voice came louder. The coolie was still there. \"You cannot sit here all night,\" he said. \"By daylight they will catch you. Come. Perhaps I can take you to your friends.
