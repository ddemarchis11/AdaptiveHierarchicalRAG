      "text": "for going without the rum.\" STRENGTH OF MIND. We have been talking about the strength of muscles; but the very best kind of strength we have is brain strength, or strength of mind. Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can not carry their messages correctly. Then the brain can not think well. Alcohol does not strengthen the mind. Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make him useful and happy. Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole. Would you be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a palace, and had a million of dollars? If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not let alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. What things were left out of our bill of fare?           2. How could you measure your strength?           3. How can you gain strength?           4. Why does drinking beer not make",

If the starch in your mother's starch-box at home should be changed into sugar, you would think it a very strange thing. Every year, in the spring-time, many thousand pounds of starch are changed into sugar in a hidden, quiet way, so that most of us think nothing about it. STARCH AND SUGAR. All kinds of grain are full of starch. If you plant them in the ground, where they are kept moist and warm, they begin to sprout and grow, to send little roots down into the earth, and little stems up into the sunshine. These little roots and stems must be fed with sugar; thus, in a wise way, which is too wonderful for you to understand, as soon as the seed begins to sprout, its starch begins to turn into sugar. [Illustration] If you should chew two grains of wheat, one before sprouting and one after, you could tell by the taste that this is true. Barley is a kind of grain from which the brewer makes beer. He must first turn its starch into sugar, so he begins by sprouting his grain. Of course he does not plant it in the ground, because it would need to be quickly dug up again. He keeps it warm and moist in a place where he can watch it, and stop the sprouting just in time to save the sugar, before it is used to feed the root",

This bending over, also cramps the lungs, so that they do not have all the room they need for breathing. While you are young, your bones are easily bent. One shoulder or one hip gets higher than the other, if you stand unevenly. This is more serious, because you are growing, and you may grow crooked before you know it. Now that you know how soft your bones are, and how easily they bend, you will surely be careful to sit and stand erect. Do not twist your legs, or arms, or shoulders; for you want to grow into straight and graceful men and women, instead of being round-shouldered, or hump-backed, or lame, all your lives. When people are old, their bones contain more lime, and, therefore, break more easily. You should be kindly helpful to old people, so that they may not fall, and possibly break their bones. CARE OF THE FEET. Healthy children are always out-growing their shoes, and sometimes faster than they wear them out. Tight shoes cause corns and in-growing nails and other sore places on the feet.

If you were going to build a house, would it be wise for you to put into the stone-work of the cellar something that would make it less strong? Something into the brick-work or the mortar, the wood-work or the nails, the walls or the chimneys, that would make them weak and tottering, instead of strong and steady? It would he had enough if you should repair your house with poor materials; but surely it must be built in the first place with the best you can get. You will soon learn that boys and girls are building their bodies, day after day, until at last they reach full size. Afterward, they must be repaired as fast as they wear out. It would be foolish to build any part in a way to make it weaker than need be. Wise doctors have said that the boy who uses tobacco while he is growing, makes every part of his body less strong than it otherwise would be. Even his bones will not grow so well.

You have learned about the twenty-four little bones in the spine, and the ribs that curve around from the spine to the front, or breast-bone. These bones, with the shoulder-blades and the collar-bones, form a bony case or box. In it are some of the most useful organs of the body. This box is divided across the middle by a strong muscle, so that we may say it is two stories high. The upper room is called the chest; the lower one, the abdomen ([)a]b d[=o]'m[)e]n). In the chest, are the heart and the lungs. In the abdomen, are the stomach, the liver, and some other organs. THE STOMACH. The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful a bag as could be made, you will say, when I tell you what it can do.
