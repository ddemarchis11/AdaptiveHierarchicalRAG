She told me how many of them were hers, and what prizes they had gained, and what hard work it was. She could neither read nor write, she said, but she liked her children to be good scholars, and they learnt a deal up at Sennen. Apparently they did, and something else besides learning, for when I had parted from my loquacious friend, I came up to the group just in time to prevent a stand-up fight between two small mites, the _casus belli_ of which I could no more arrive at, than a great many wiser people can discover the origin of national wars. So I thought the strong hand of \"intervention\"--civilised intervention--was best, and put an end to it, administering first a good scolding, and then a coin. The division of this coin among the little party compelled an extempore sum in arithmetic, which I required them to do (for the excellent reason that I couldn't do it myself!)--and they did it! Therefore I conclude that the heads of the Sennen school-children are as solid as their fists, and equally good for use. [Illustration: ON THE ROAD TO ST.
