  "llm_answer": "The text does not provide a direct reasoning path from Mayab's similarity with Hindostan to the Mayas' conflict with the Spanish. However, it mentions that the Mayas had many signs and characters identical to the Egyptians and the Carians, and that the Carians' customs and mode of life were similar to those of the people of Yucatan. It also mentions that the goddess Maia, the daughter of Atlantis, was worshiped in Greece, and that the name of the CARAS is found over a vast extension of country in America. \n\nThe text then jumps to a discussion about the author's habit of giving an account of the characters he meets, and his own self-reflection. It does not provide a clear connection between Mayab's similarity with Hindostan and the Mayas' conflict with the Spanish.",

The Mayas and the Egyptians had many signs and characters identical; possessing the same alphabetical and symbolical value in both nations. Among the symbolical, I may cite a few: _water_, _country or region_, _king_, _Lord_, _offerings_, _splendor_, the _various emblems of the sun_ and many others. Among the alphabetical, a very large number of the so-called Demotic, by Egyptologists, are found even in the inscription of the _Akab[c]ib_ at Chichen; and not a few of the most ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs in the mural inscriptions at Uxmal. In these I have been able to discover the Egyptian characters corresponding to our own. A a, B, C, CH or K, D, T, I, L, M, N, H, P, TZ, PP, U, OO, X, having the same sound and value as in the Spanish language, with the exception of the K, TZ, PP and X, which are pronounced in a way peculiar to the Mayas.

If identical customs and manners, and the worship of the same divinities under the same name, besides the traditions of a people pointing towards a certain point of the globe as being the birth-place of their ancestors, prove anything, then I must say that in Egypt also we meet with the tracks of the Mayas, of whose name we again have a reminiscence in that of the goddess Maia, the daughter of Atlantis, worshiped in Greece.

The Egyptians, in expressing their ideas in writing, used three different kinds of characters--phonetic, ideographic and symbolic--placed either in vertical columns or in horizontal lines, to be read from right to left, from left to right, as indicated by the position of the figures of men or animals. So, also, the Mayas in their writings employed phonetic, symbolic and ideographic signs, combining these often, forming monograms as we do to-day, placing them in such a manner as best suited the arrangement of the ornamentation of the facade of the edifices. At present we can only speak with certainty of the monumental inscriptions, the books that fell in the hands of the ecclesiastics at the time of the conquest having been destroyed. No truly genuine written monuments of the Mayas are known to exist, except those inclosed within the sealed apartments, where the priests and learned men of MAYAB hid them from the _Nahualt_ or _Toltec_ invaders. As the Egyptians, they wrote in vertical columns and horizontal lines, to be read generally from right to left.

Behind them, a sudden voice called out two words which were caught up and echoed harshly in the street. Heywood whipped about. \"Never called me that before,\" he said quickly. \"Come outside.\" He flung back a hurried sentence to the merchant, caught Rudolph's arm, and plunged into the crowd. The yellow men gave passage mechanically, but with lowering faces. Once free in the muddy path, he halted quickly, and looked about. \"Might have known,\" he grumbled. \"Never called me 'Foreign Dog' before, or 'Jesus man,' He set 'em on.\" Rudolph followed his look. In the dim light, at the outskirts of the rabble, a man was turning away, with an air of contempt or unconcern.

Even Heywood sat listening--with more attention than respect, for once he muttered, \"Rot!\" Toward the close, however, he leaned across and whispered, \"The old boy reels it off rather well to-night.
