  "llm_answer": "The passages do not mention the triplets. However, they do describe the interplay between local rulers and foreign influences in Morocco. The region's internal governance is demonstrated through the descriptions of the Emperor residing at Mequinez and the Sultan in Salee, as well as the local customs and traditions. The external challenges are highlighted through historical events such as England's occupation of Tangier, the French bombardment of Mogador, and the Portuguese destruction of Anfa.",

Seisouan, or Sousan, is the capital of the Rif province, situate also on the borders of the province of the Habat, and by the sources of a little river which runs into the Mediterranean, near Cape Mazari. The town is small, but full of artizans and merchants. The country around is fertile, being well irrigated with streams. Sousan is the most beautifully picturesque of all the Atlas range. Sofou, or Sofron, is a fine walled city, southeast of Fez, situate upon the river Guizo; in a vast and well-watered plain near, are rich mines of fossil salt.
