So, being feeble on my feet, though steady in my head, I agreed to sit like a cormorant on the nearest cliff, and look down placidly upon the young adventurers in their next delightful scramble. It could not be to-night, however, for the tide was coming in fast; the fairy cove would soon be all under water. \"Shall we get a boat?
