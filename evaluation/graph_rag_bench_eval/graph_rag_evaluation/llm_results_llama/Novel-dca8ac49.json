The other fishes, always chasing me, seemed distracted by the newcomers. I kept close to the rocks at Lizard, wary of both humans and my fellow fish.",

The moon shone brightly on the wet sand, and I swam about, feeling the silvery glow on my body. I burrowed into the sand just above the waterline, feeling safe and hidden. But then, disaster struck. A group of fishermen, armed with a crooked iron spear, came to my home. They stood up to their ankles on the wet sand, trying to hook me up. I tried to wriggle away, but it was too late. One of them managed to catch me, and I was seized with their left hand. I'm not sure what will happen to me now, but I'm just glad I got to experience the beauty of the moonlit night before my fate was sealed.",

There was in one of our guide-books a most glowing description of the Old Inn, and also an extract from a poem, apostrophising the charms of Mary Mundy. When we said we knew the enthusiastic Scotch Professor who had written it, we felt that we rose a step in the estimation of Charles. \"And Mary will be so pleased to see anybody who knows the gentleman\"--in Cornwall the noted Greek Professor was merely \"the gentleman.\" \"She's got his poem in her visitors' book and his portrait in her album. I do hope Mary will be at home.\" But fate was against us. When we reached Mullion and drove up to the door of the Old Inn, there darted out to meet us, not Mary, but an individual concerning whom Fame has been unjustly silent. \"It's only Mary's brother,\" said Charles, with an accent of deep disappointment. But as the honest man who had apparently gone through life as \"Mary's brother\" stood patting our horse and talking to our driver, with both of whom he seemed on terms of equal intimacy, his welcome to ourselves was such a mixture of cordiality and despair that we could scarcely keep from laughing.",

My young people say it requires a practised hand and a peculiar twist of the wrist, to have any success at all in launce fishing. It can only be done on moonlight nights--the full moon and a day or two after--and they are out half the night. They go about barefoot, which is much safer than soaked shoes and stockings. About midnight they light a fire on the sand, cook all the fish they have caught, and have a grand supper, as they had last night. They came home as merry as crickets about two o'clock this morning.

One cannot imagine Sir Tristram or Sir Launcelot occupied in spearing a small sand-eel. The bathing at Housel Cove was delightful as ever. And afterwards we saw that very rare and beautiful sight, a perfect solar rainbow. Not the familiar bow of Noah, but a great luminous circle round the sun, like the halo often seen round the moon, extending over half the sky; yellow at first, then gradually assuming faint prismatic tints. This colouring, though never so bright as the ordinary arched rainbow, was wonderfully tender and delicate. We stood a long time watching it, till at last it melted slowly out of the sky, leaving behind a sense of mystery, as of something we had never seen before and might never see again in all our lives. It was a lovely day, bright and warm as midsummer, tempting us to some distant excursion; but we had decided to investigate the Lizard Lights.
