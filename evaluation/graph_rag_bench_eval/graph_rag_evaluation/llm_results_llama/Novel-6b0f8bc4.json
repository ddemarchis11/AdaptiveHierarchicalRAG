Jupiter himself disappeared from my thoughts. Pardon me, O Jove; no aid did thy weapons afford me; the shut door was a more potent thunderbolt than thine. I forthwith resumed the language of endearment and trifling Elegies, those weapons of my own; and gentle words prevailed upon the obdurate door. Verses bring down [303] the horns of the blood-stained Moon; and they recall the snow-white steeds of the Sun in his career.
