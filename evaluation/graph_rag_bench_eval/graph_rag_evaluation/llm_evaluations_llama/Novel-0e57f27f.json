    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain evidence supporting the claim about Eily's desire for wealth or diamonds and pearls. However, it fails to address the user's question directly, which is about Eily's aspirations as described in the story. The Gold Answer provides specific details about Eily's wishes, which are not reflected in the Model Answer, leading to a lack of evidence coverage and correctness."
