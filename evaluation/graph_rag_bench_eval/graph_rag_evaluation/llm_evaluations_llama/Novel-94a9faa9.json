    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly interprets Rudolph's trembling as indicative of a power imbalance and emotional tension, aligning with the Gold Answer's core meaning. However, the retrieved context does not explicitly support the detailed claims about admiration, fear, or inferiority, making the faithfulness to context partial. Additionally, the Model Answer does not explicitly mention the framing of subsequent events across all chains, as highlighted in the Gold Answer, leading to partial evidence coverage."
