    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain any information about potash or its involvement in the manufacturing of telescopes. This aligns with the absence of relevant details in the context, making the answer both correct and faithful. Additionally, the Gold Answer's key fact about potash being used for making glass cannot be verified or addressed due to the lack of supporting evidence in the context."
