    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that Mr. Darbey is seen by The Dean and spoken to by Sheba, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, the claim that Mr. Darbey is a suitor for Salome's hand in marriage is unsupported by the retrieved context, which does not provide evidence for this detail. This reduces faithfulness to the context and partially impacts evidence coverage."
