    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the core of the User's Question, which is about the Ninety-Two Resolutions and their demand for Lord Aylmer's impeachment. The Gold Answer clearly states this demand, but the Model Answer does not provide relevant information or directly answer the question. Additionally, the claim that the Ninety-Two Resolutions are not explicitly mentioned in the context regarding Lord Aylmer is incorrect, as the context does reference Lord Aylmer and the Ninety-Two Resolutions indirectly. The Model Answer neither aligns with the Gold Answer nor utilizes the context effectively."
