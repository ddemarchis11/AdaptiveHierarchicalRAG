    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies 'the image of my early youth' and 'Pepin' as the figure coming to the Poet, which is not supported by the context or the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer clearly states 'Tragedy came to the Poet,' and this is not reflected in the Model Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide evidence for the claims made in the Model Answer, making it unfaithful and lacking evidence coverage."
