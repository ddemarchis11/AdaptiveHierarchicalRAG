    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the context does not provide the name of the primary home for Toto and his grandmother, which is incorrect as the Gold Answer specifies 'Cottage.' The context does not explicitly contradict the Gold Answer but does not directly confirm it either. The Model Answer fails to address the question correctly and misses the key fact from the Gold Answer."
