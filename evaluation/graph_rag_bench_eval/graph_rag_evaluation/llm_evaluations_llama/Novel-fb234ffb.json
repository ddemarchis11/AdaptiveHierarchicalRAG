  "question": "In what way was the city of Hamburg involved in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, especially through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'?",
  "gold_answer": "Hamburg was involved through the Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent, which reviewed Tristram Shandy and was edited by Bode.",
  "llm_answer": "The city of Hamburg played a significant role in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, particularly through the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent', a journal that reviewed 'Tristram Shandy' in 1767. The journal's review was characterized by unstinted praise for Sterne's deviation from conventional homiletical discourse and his ability to paint moral character and situations. Additionally, Bode, a resident of Hamburg and editor of the journal, later published his own version of 'Tristram Shandy' in 1774, which suggests that Hamburg was a hub for the dissemination and appreciation of Sterne's works in Germany.",
