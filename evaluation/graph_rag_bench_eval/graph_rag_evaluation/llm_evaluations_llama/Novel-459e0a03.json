    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies 'Augustin' and 'Gus' as names for THE DEAN, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, the claim that THE DEAN is referred to as 'Sir Tristram Mardon's father' and 'Sporting Dean' is unsupported by the retrieved context. The context does not confirm these additional names, making the answer partially correct and unfaithful to the provided evidence."
