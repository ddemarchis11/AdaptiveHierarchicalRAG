  "gold_answer": "Fez has trade with Morocco and sends caravans to Timbuctoo.",
  "llm_answer": "The novel does not describe the commercial activities of Fez within the broader African context. The information provided does not mention Fez's trade with other parts of Morocco or its role as a departure point for caravans to Timbuctoo.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the novel does not describe the commercial activities of Fez, whereas the Gold Answer clearly mentions Fez's trade with Morocco and its role in sending caravans to Timbuctoo. The Retrieved Context does not explicitly contradict the Gold Answer, but the Model Answer fails to address the question and does not utilize the context effectively to provide a relevant response."
