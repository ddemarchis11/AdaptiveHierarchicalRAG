  "question": "In the story, how does Rags demonstrate responsibility and care for the baby Margaret, particularly in the actions he takes regarding her well-being?",
  "gold_answer": "Rags felt responsibility and self-respect for Margaret and bathed the baby's face, hands, and feet.",
  "llm_answer": "There is no mention of Rags or a baby Margaret in the provided context.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not mention Rags or baby Margaret, but it fails to answer the user's question using internal knowledge or reasoning. The Gold Answer provides specific actions taken by Rags, which are not addressed in the Model Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not contain the necessary information or facts from the Gold Answer."
