  "gold_answer": "No, Cousin Cæsar did not recognize Steve Brindle.",
  "llm_answer": "Cousin Cæsar recognized Steve Brindle in the distance during the battle. However, the outcome of their meeting is not explicitly stated in the provided context, only that Cousin Cæsar was left with the idea that Steve Brindle had deserted.",

    "answer_correctness": 0.5,

    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer partially addresses the question but misinterprets the context. While Cousin Cæsar did recognize Steve Brindle, the Gold Answer explicitly states that Cousin Cæsar did not recognize Steve Brindle during their encounter after the battle. The Model Answer also fails to clearly state the outcome of their meeting, which is that Cousin Cæsar did not acknowledge Steve Brindle due to his desire to conceal his antecedents. Additionally, the claim about Steve Brindle's desertion is not fully supported by the retrieved context, leading to partial faithfulness and evidence coverage."
