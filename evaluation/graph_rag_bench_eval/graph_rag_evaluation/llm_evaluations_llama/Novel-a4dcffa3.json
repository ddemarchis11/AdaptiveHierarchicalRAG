    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question about Roman customs of mixing water with wine, which is clearly stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide relevant information about Roman wine practices, but the Model Answer does not use internal knowledge to provide the correct answer either. Therefore, it is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and lacks evidence coverage."
