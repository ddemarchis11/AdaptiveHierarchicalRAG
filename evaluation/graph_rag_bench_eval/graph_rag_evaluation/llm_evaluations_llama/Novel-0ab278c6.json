    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question about Miss Euphemia Trotter's early life and circumstances leading her to become a teacher at an Eastern seminary. It incorrectly claims that no information is available in the context, despite the Gold Answer providing a clear summary. The retrieved context does not contain relevant information about Miss Euphemia Trotter, but the Model Answer does not utilize internal knowledge to provide a correct response either."
