    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not contain information about the chain involving Love and Iasius linking Ceres to Jupiter. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge, which is expected when the context is insufficient. The Gold Answer provides the necessary information, but the Model Answer does not address it, resulting in low correctness and evidence coverage scores."
