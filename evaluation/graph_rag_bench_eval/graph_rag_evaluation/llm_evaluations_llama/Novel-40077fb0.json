  "llm_answer": "The interconnectedness of the Hall and Stickney families is portrayed through the marriage of Asaph Hall and Angeline Stickney, as well as the lineage connecting Moses Stickney as Angeline's grandfather.

  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the marriage of Asaph Hall and Angeline Stickney and the lineage connecting Moses Stickney as Angeline's grandfather, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, the additional claim about Angelo Hall writing a letter to Peggy and mentioning Angeline Stickney's educational background and her sons attending Harvard is unsupported by the retrieved context. This reduces faithfulness to the context and partially impacts evidence coverage, as the core facts are present but supplemented with unsupported details."
