    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about Lessing's authorship of 'Hamburgische Dramaturgie' or the review of 'Tristram Shandy' by the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent'. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. The Gold Answer provides clear information that the Model Answer does not address, resulting in a score of 0 for correctness and evidence coverage, but the faithfulness score is high as the Model Answer does not contradict the context."
