    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question about Eileen Macarthy directing her questions to the doctor. It incorrectly states that no information is available, despite the Gold Answer providing a clear response. Additionally, the retrieved context does not contain relevant information about Eileen Macarthy or Dr. O'Shaughnessy's house, making the Model Answer ungrounded and irrelevant."
