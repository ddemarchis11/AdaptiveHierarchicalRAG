    "explanation": "The Model Answer partially addresses the question by mentioning Pepys's interaction with the Duke of York regarding the Navy's financial condition, which could be interpreted as a professional responsibility. However, it does not directly confirm or elaborate on the specific incident of the Duke sending an official order to Pepys, as stated in the Gold Answer. The retrieved context does not clearly support the claim about the Duke sending an order, and the Model Answer introduces details that are not fully grounded in the provided context."
