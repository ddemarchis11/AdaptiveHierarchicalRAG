    "explanation": "The Model Answer mentions the psalter of the seventh century and David playing the _rotta_, which is relevant to ancient musical instruments but does not directly address the specific items listed in the Gold Answer (bells, cymbals, Greek lyre fragment, tibia, Anglo-Saxon trumpets). Additionally, the Retrieved Context does not support the claim about the British Museum's collection, making the answer unfaithful to the context."
