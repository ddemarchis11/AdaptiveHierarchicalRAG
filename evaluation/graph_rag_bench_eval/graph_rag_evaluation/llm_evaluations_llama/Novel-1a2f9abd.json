    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Salee is 110 miles from Rabat, which contradicts the Gold Answer and the geographical relationship implied. The Gold Answer states that Rabat is opposite Salee, which is not addressed or supported by the Model Answer. Additionally, the Retrieved Context does not provide information to support the claim about the distance or their relationship as described in the Model Answer."
