    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Rudolph stood with Heywood, while the Gold Answer specifies Mrs. Forrester. The retrieved context does not support the claim that Rudolph stood with Heywood during the described event, nor does it provide evidence for the Gold Answer. The Model Answer fails to align with the Gold Answer and lacks grounding in the provided context."
