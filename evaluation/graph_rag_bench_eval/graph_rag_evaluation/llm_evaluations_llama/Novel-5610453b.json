    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Mr. Inglis resided in Melville Street after Mrs. Inglis' death, which pertains to a different time period and individual. The Gold Answer specifies Edinburgh as Mr. Inglis' residence following his return from India, and this is not addressed in the Model Answer. Additionally, the Retrieved Context does not support the claim about Melville Street, making the answer unfaithful and lacking evidence coverage."
