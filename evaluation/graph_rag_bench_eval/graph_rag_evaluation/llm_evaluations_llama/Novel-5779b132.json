    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about the process of making sugar, as described in the subgraphs. However, it fails to provide the Gold Answer ('Sugar is made from Sugar Maple') which could have been inferred from general knowledge or internal understanding. Thus, the answer is incorrect in terms of correctness and evidence coverage, but faithful to the context provided."
