  "question": "In the chapter where Trost discusses technological advancement, how does the text describe the relationship between the human organism and the machine, especially with regard to the idea that the machine is an extension of the human organism?",
  "gold_answer": "The machine is described as an extension of the human organism.",
  "llm_answer": "According to Trost, the machine is an extension of the human organism, specifically \"limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more subtle finger-tips, ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the invisibly small.\" This suggests that the machine is a tool that amplifies and enhances human capabilities, rather than replacing or superseding them.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly captures the core idea from the Gold Answer that the machine is an extension of the human organism. It elaborates further, supported by the Retrieved Context, describing machines as powerful extensions of human limbs and capabilities. This additional detail is relevant, grounded in the context, and consistent with the Gold Answer."
