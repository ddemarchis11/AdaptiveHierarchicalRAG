  "question": "In the narrative surrounding the mysterious attacks at the Ramierez fonda, how does Richards's attraction to Cota influence his actions, and what similar experience does he share with Colonel Starbottle regarding being assaulted near the fonda?",
  "gold_answer": "Richards is attracted to Cota and was attacked like Colonel Starbottle.",
  "llm_answer": "I cannot answer this question as it is not present in the provided context.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question and incorrectly claims the information is not present in the context. While the context does not explicitly detail Richards's attraction to Cota or the similarity of his experience to Colonel Starbottle's, the Gold Answer provides a concise summary that the model should have inferred or addressed. The model's response is neither correct nor faithful to the context, and it does not cover the key facts from the Gold Answer."
