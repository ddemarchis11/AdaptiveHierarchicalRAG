    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not address the specific uses of trees or products made from them as outlined in the Gold Answer. It introduces information about palm trees, redwood trees, sycamore trees, and pine trees, none of which are relevant to the Sugar Maple or its uses for furniture, cooking, warmth, or sugar production. Additionally, the retrieved context does not support the claims made in the Model Answer, making it unfaithful and irrelevant to the question."
