    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that there is no information about Brindle Bill expressing disbelief toward any character, while the Gold Answer clearly states that Brindle Bill did not believe Rose. The retrieved context does not directly support the Gold Answer, but the Model Answer fails to address the question correctly or provide relevant information."
