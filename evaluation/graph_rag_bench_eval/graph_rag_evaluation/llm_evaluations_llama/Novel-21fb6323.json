    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the British government did not suppress the French language and mentions the Quebec Act of 1774, which guaranteed certain rights. However, it does not specifically address the use of French in law-courts or its status relative to English, which are central to the User's Question and the Gold Answer. Additionally, the claim about the Quebec Act is not supported by the retrieved context, making the answer unfaithful to the provided evidence."
