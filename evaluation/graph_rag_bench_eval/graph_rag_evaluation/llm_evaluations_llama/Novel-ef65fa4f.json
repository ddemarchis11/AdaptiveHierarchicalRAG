    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies the group as the inhabitants of equatorial Africa, whereas the Gold Answer specifies the Carians. The retrieved context supports the Gold Answer, mentioning the Carians' customs being similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan. The Model Answer is neither correct nor faithful to the context, and it fails to cover the key fact about the Carians."
