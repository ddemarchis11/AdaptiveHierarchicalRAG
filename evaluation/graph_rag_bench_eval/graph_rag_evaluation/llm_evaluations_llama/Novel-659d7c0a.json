    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not mention the huehuetl or teponaztli, which are the specific instruments identified in the Gold Answer. Instead, it lists other instruments like pipes, flutes, whistles, and a sonorous metal, which are mentioned in the Retrieved Context but are not directly relevant to the question about Aztec musical instruments. While the Model Answer is partially grounded in the context, it fails to address the core facts required by the Gold Answer."
