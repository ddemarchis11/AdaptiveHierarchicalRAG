    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about where THE DEAN places the medicine chest when preparing a remedy for Dandy Dick. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or reasoning, which would have been possible given the Gold Answer. Thus, the answer is incorrect, but it remains faithful to the context provided."
