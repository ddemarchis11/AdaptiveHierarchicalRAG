    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Rudolph confessed his thoughts and feelings to Heywood, but the Model Answer incorrectly suggests that Rudolph did not explicitly confess to anyone and mentions Miss Forrester instead. This is not supported by the retrieved context, which does not provide evidence of Rudolph confessing to Miss Forrester or failing to confess to Heywood. The Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and misses the key fact from the Gold Answer."
