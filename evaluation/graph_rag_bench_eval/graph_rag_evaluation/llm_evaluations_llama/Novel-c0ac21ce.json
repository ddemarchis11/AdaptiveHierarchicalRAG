    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question correctly, as it does not provide the information that Heinse wrote to Gleim, which is the core of the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not contain relevant information about Heinse's correspondence, so the Model Answer is not grounded in the context and does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
