    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly mentions Elsie Maud Inglis's role in explaining the Scottish Women's Hospitals' plan and her involvement in fundraising and organizing units for Serbia. However, it omits the specific connection involving Miss Burke and America's aid, which is central to the Gold Answer. While partially grounded in the context, the Model Answer does not fully align with the retrieved details about Miss Burke's influence and the subsequent journey to Serbia."
