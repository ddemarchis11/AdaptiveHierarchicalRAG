    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not contain information about Dan Emmet's involvement with Bryant's Minstrels or the song 'Dixie.' However, it fails to answer the question using external knowledge, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. Thus, the answer correctness and evidence coverage are rated as 0.0, while faithfulness to context is rated as 1.0 since the model does not fabricate information."
