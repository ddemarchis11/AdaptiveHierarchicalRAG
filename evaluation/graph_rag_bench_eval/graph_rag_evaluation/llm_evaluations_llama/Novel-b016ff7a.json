    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides an interpretation of the significance of the mustang, focusing on Cota's independence and priorities, but it does not directly address the specific actions described in the Gold Answer (Grey throwing himself across the mustang and Cota caring only for the horse). Additionally, the Retrieved Context does not contain information to support the claims made in the Model Answer, making it unfaithful to the context and missing the key facts from the Gold Answer."
