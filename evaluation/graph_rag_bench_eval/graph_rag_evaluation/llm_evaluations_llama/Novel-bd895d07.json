  "question": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, how does the body process food for use in growth and energy, specifically through the preparation of food by the stomach and the transportation of this food by the blood?",
  "gold_answer": "The stomach prepares food, and food is carried by blood.",
  "llm_answer": "The stomach works the food over, mixes in gastric juice, until it is all a gray fluid. This prepared food is then taken into the blood, which carries it to the heart. The heart pumps it out with the blood into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle, and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain.",
