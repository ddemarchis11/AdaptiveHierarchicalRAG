  "question": "Who constructed the Rice house, recognized as one of the first brick buildings and principal hotels in early St. Paul?",
  "gold_answer": "Henry M. Rice constructed the Rice house.",
  "llm_answer": "I couldn't find any information about the Rice house in the provided context.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not contain information about the Rice house or its construction. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. The Gold Answer clearly identifies Henry M. Rice as the constructor, but this fact is not addressed in the Model Answer."
