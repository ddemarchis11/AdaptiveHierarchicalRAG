  "llm_answer": "Heywood treated Rudolph with a sense of camaraderie and familiarity, as evident from their conversation and actions together.

    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not address the specific question about Heywood's treatment of Rudolph during the tense events at the nunnery or the name Heywood was called by in the narrative. It incorrectly states that Heywood was called 'Heywood' and 'Rudie,' which contradicts the Gold Answer and is unsupported by the retrieved context. The answer fails to provide the correct information that Heywood scoffed at Rudolph and was called Maurice."
