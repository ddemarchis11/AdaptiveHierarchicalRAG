  "llm_answer": "The narrative reveals the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" and Augustin's role as the Dean. This is evident when Georgiana refers to herself as \"George Tidd\" and when Augustin is addressed as \"Dean\" by others. This use of nicknames and alternate identities suggests that the characters are trying to conceal or present themselves in a particular way, which has an impact on the unfolding of their personal and social identities.",
