    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the text does not mention Toser and instead discusses St. Ives, which is irrelevant to the question. The Gold Answer clearly identifies gardens as a notable feature of Toser, but the Model Answer fails to address this or provide any relevant information about Toser's environment."
