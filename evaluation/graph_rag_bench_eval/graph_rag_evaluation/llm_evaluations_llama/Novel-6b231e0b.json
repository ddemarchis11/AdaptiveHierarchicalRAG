    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Kynance as being in Cornwall, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it does not explicitly mention 'Kynance Cove' or the feature 'Devil's Throat,' which are key facts from the Gold Answer. Additionally, while the context mentions Kynance and Cornwall, it does not provide explicit grounding for the connection described in the Model Answer, leading to partial faithfulness and evidence coverage."
