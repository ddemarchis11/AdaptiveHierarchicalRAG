  "gold_answer": "The kinnor, rendered as harp, is found in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript, showing a link from the Middle East (kinnor) to Europe (Anglo-Saxon manuscript).",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not address the question about the diffusion of harp-related musical practices from the Middle East into Europe. However, it fails to provide any answer to the question itself, which is clearly addressed in the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer mentions the kinnor (harp) found in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript as evidence of this diffusion, but the Model Answer does not include this information or attempt to answer the question using external knowledge."
