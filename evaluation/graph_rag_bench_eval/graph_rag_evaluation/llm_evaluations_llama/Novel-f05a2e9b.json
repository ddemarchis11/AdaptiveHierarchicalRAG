    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that it cannot find information about Louis and his wife discussing a return, but the Gold Answer clearly specifies that Louis intended to return to Paris. The retrieved context does not provide relevant information to support the Gold Answer or the Model Answer, but the Model Answer fails to address the question correctly or acknowledge the Gold Answer's claim."
