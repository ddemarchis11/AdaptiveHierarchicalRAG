  "question": "Imagine you are the Duke of Wellington. Write a diary entry about your efforts to emancipate the Catholics and your thoughts on the Irish and English relations.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today I continued my advocacy for Catholic emancipation. I am aware that the Catholics of this era know the necessity of modesty, especially considering their Irish heritage. There is a sentiment in high places that the Irish have been too lenient toward the English, and yet, England itself is a nation with a sense of common descent and unity. My hope is that these reforms will foster greater harmony across all these groups.",
  "llm_answer": "I cannot write a diary entry for the Duke of Wellington as there is no information in the provided context about his efforts to emancipate the Catholics or his thoughts on the Irish and English relations.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about the Duke of Wellington's efforts for Catholic emancipation or his thoughts on Irish and English relations. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or creativity, as expected for this task. The Gold Answer provides a fictional diary entry, which the Model Answer does not attempt to replicate. While the response is faithful to the context, it does not address the user's request or include the key facts from the Gold Answer."
