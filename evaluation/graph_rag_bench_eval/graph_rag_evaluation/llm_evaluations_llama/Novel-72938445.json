    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about an apple jelly factory or storage bins holding apples. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or reasoning, which would have been possible given the simplicity of the Gold Answer. Thus, the answer is incorrect, but it remains faithful to the context provided."
