    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that epidemics occur in Washington, D.C., based on a misinterpretation of the retrieved context. The Gold Answer specifies Yucatan as the region where epidemics occur, and this is not mentioned or supported in the Model Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide evidence to support the Model Answer's claim about Washington, D.C."
