    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not contain information about a present being carried to the Britannic Majesty. However, the Gold Answer explicitly mentions 'The Bey carried a present to Britannic Majesty,' which the Model Answer fails to address. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not answer the question correctly or cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
