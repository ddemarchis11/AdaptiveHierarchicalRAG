    "explanation": "The Model Answer partially addresses the question by mentioning Chaacmol's funeral chamber and Augustus Le Plongeon's research, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it fails to mention the circumstances of Chaacmol's death at the hands of Aac, which is a critical part of the Gold Answer. Additionally, the claims about Chaacmol being a 'culture hero' and the depiction of his life in mural paintings are not supported by the retrieved context, making the answer unfaithful to the provided evidence."
