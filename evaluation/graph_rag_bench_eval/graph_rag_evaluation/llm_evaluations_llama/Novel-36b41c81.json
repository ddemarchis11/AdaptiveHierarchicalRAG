    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that coal dust is mixed with broken coal pitch, which contradicts the Gold Answer that specifies coal dust is mixed with grains. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide clear evidence to support the Model Answer's claim about broken coal pitch being used in the manufacture of agglomerated artificial fuel. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and does not cover the key facts from the Gold Answer."
