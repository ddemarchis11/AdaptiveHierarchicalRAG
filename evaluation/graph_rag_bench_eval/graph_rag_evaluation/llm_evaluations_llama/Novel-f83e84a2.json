    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (N.U.W.S.S.) as the association Elsie Maud Inglis wrote to for support or collaboration during the organization of medical units. The Gold Answer specifies the Registered Medical Women's Association, and there is no evidence in the retrieved context to support the Model Answer's claim. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
