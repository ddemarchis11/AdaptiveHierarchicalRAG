    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about Chris Calton's convalescence or Frida Jansen attending to him. However, it fails to provide the correct answer, which is 'Frida Jansen attended to Chris Calton,' as stated in the Gold Answer. The retrieved context is irrelevant to the question, so the model's response is faithful to the context but does not answer the question or cover the evidence."
