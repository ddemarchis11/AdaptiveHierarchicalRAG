    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly captures the sequence of suggestion, interruption, and gratitude as described in the Gold Answer. However, the Retrieved Context does not provide any evidence or grounding for the specific interactions between Mrs. Tarbox, Hiram, and Brice mentioned in the Model Answer. Therefore, while the answer is correct in terms of information containment, it is not faithful to the provided context, and the evidence coverage is zero as the context does not support the claims."
