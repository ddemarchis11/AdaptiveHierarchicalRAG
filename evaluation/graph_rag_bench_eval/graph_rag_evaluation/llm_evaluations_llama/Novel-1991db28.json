    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the impeachment of Lord Aylmer as a demand of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it incorrectly attributes opposition to the resolutions to the Legislative Council and Lord Aylmer, which is not supported by the retrieved context or the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer specifically mentions Quesnel, John Neilson, Augustin Cuvillier, and F. A. Quesnel as opposing figures, which the Model Answer fails to include. Additionally, the claim about the removal of the governor and Executive Council and establishment of a new government is unsupported by the retrieved context, reducing faithfulness to 0.0."
