    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that no information was found in the context regarding the treaty, which is accurate based on the retrieved context. However, it fails to answer the question directly, which is clearly addressed in the Gold Answer ('No, the Moorish envoy was unable to conclude a treaty of peace with France'). The Model Answer does not contradict the context but misses the core factual point entirely."
