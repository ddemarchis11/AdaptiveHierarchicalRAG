    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Ruth as Angeline Stickney's sister and mentions their close companionship, which aligns partially with the Gold Answer. However, it does not address their connection during their educational journey at McGrawville, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the Retrieved Context does not provide grounding for the claim about their inseparable companionship or childhood activities, making the answer unfaithful to the context."
