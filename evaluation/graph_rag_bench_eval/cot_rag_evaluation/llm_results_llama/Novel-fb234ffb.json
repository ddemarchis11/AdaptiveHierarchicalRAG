  "gold_answer": "Hamburg was involved through the Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent, which reviewed Tristram Shandy and was edited by Bode.",
  "llm_answer": "The city of Hamburg was involved in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'. \n\nBode, who was a resident of Hamburg at the time, was exceptionally proficient in English and was the editor of the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' from 1763-3. He reviewed 'Tristram Shandy' in the journal, and his review is believed to have been written by Bode himself. \n\nBode later published his own version of 'Tristram Shandy' in 1774, which was a translation of the novel into German. The translation was published in nine parts, and it is believed that Bode's translation was influenced by his earlier review of the novel in the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent'. \n\nThe 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' also played a role in promoting Sterne's works in Germany. The journal reviewed 'Tristram Shandy' and other works by Sterne, and it helped to raise awareness of Sterne's writing among German readers. \n\nIn addition, Bode's translation of 'Tristram Shandy' was widely popular in Germany, and it helped to establish Sterne as a major literary figure in the country. The translation was published in nine parts, and it contained a preface in which Bode discussed the novel and its author. \n\nOverall, the city of Hamburg played an important role in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, and Bode's translation of 'Tristram Shandy' was a key factor in this process.",

      "text": "is not to be located with certainty, yet it may well have been Bode, the later apostle of Sterne-worship in Germany. Bode was a resident of Hamburg at this time, was exceptionally proficient in English and, according to Jördens[13] and Schröder,[14] he was in 1762-3 the editor of the _Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_. The precise date when Bode severed his connection with the paper is indeterminate, yet this, the second number of the new year 1764, may have come under his supervision even if his official connection ended exactly with the close of the old year. To be sure, when Bode ten years later published his own version of Shandy, he translated, with the exception of two rather insignificant cases, none of the passages verbally the same as the reviewer in this journal, but it would be unreasonable to attach any great weight to this fact. Eight or nine years later, when undertaking the monumental task of rendering the whole of Shandy into German, it is not likely that Bode would recall the old translations he had made in this review or concern himself about them. A brief comparison of the two sets of translations suggests that the critic was striving merely for accuracy in correcting the errors of Zückert, and that Bode in his formal translation shows a riper and more certain feeling for the choice of words; the effect of purposeful reflection is",

      "text": "Bode’s translation of the Sentimental Journey contains, further, a sketch of Sterne’s life,[26] his character and his works. Bode relates the familiar story of the dog, but misses the point entirely in rendering “puppy” by “Geck” in Sterne’s reply, “So lang er ein Geck ist.” The watchcoat episode is narrated, and a brief account is given of Sterne’s fortunes in London with Tristram Shandy and the sermons. Allusion has already been made to the hints thrown out in this sketch relative to the reading of Sterne in Germany. A translation from Shandy of the passage descriptive of Parson Yorick serves as a portrait for Sterne. A second edition of Bode’s work was published in 1769. The preface, which is dated “Anfang des Monats Mai, 1769,” is in the main identical with the first, but has some significant additions. A word is said relative to his controversy with a critic, which is mentioned later.[27] Bode confesses further that the excellence of his work is due to Ebert and Lessing,[28] though modesty compelled his silence in the previous preface concerning the source of his aid. Bode admits that even this disclosure is prompted by the clever guess of a critic in the _Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_,[29] who openly named Lessing as",

A reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[10] in an account of Bode’s and Wichmann’s renderings of “Tom Jones,” begs Bode to fulfill the hopes thus raised, saying he could give Yorick’s friends no more valuable or treasured gift. Böttiger in his biographical sketch of Bode expressed regret that the work never saw the light, adding that the work contained so many allusions to contemporary celebrities and hits upon Bode’s acquaintance that wisdom had consigned to oblivion.[11] A correspondent, writing to the _Teutscher Merkur_,[12] minimizes the importance of this so-called commentary, saying “er hatte nie einen Kommentar der Art, . . . auch nur angefangen auszuarbeiten. Die ganze Sache gründet sich auf eine scherzhafte Aeusserung gegen seinem damaligen Freund in Hamburg, welchen er oft mit der ihm eignen Ironie mit diesem Kommentar zu drohen pflegte.” The list of subscribers to Bode’s translation contained upwards of 650 names, among which are Boie, Claudius, Einsieder, Gerstenberg, Gleim, Fräulein",
