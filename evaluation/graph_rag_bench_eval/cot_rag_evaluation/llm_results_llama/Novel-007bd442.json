The grandmother packs a basket with nourishing food, bandages for the broken leg, and some simple medicines for the hermit.\n4. The grandmother asks Toto to take the basket to the hermit, but Bruin insists on going himself.\n5. The grandmother hesitates, considering the possibility that Bruin might frighten the hermit, but ultimately agrees to let Bruin go.\n6.

In [Novel-41603_c_125], the grandmother is not mentioned directly, but the sequence of events continues with the hermit welcoming both Bruin and Toto, and Bruin being overcome with emotion.",

He has nothing to eat, for he will not touch raw snails, and I cannot find anything else for him. I fear he will die soon, and I shall probably die too.\" \"Come! come!\" said the bear, \"don't let me hear any nonsense of that kind. Die, indeed! Here, take that, sir, and don't talk foolishness!\" \"That\" was neither more nor less than the wing of a roast chicken which Bruin had pulled hastily from the basket. The famished crow fell upon it, beak and claw, without more ado; and a silence ensued, while the two friends, well pleased, watched the first effect of their charitable mission. \"Poor creature!\" said Toto. \"Were you ever so hungry as that, Bruin?\" \"Oh, yes!\" said the bear, carelessly, \"often and often. When I came out in the spring, you know. But I never stayed hungry very long,\" he added, with a significant grimace. \"This crow is sick, you see, and probably cannot help himself much. How does that",

I'll tell you what, old fellow!\" he added, turning to Bruin, who looked sadly crestfallen at this throwing of cold water on the fire of his kindly intentions, \"we will go together, and then the whole thing will be easily managed. I will go in first, and tell the hermit all about you; and then, when his mind is prepared, you can come in and make him comfortable.\" The good bear brightened up at this, and gladly assented to Toto's proposition; and the two set out shortly after, Bruin carrying a large basket of food, and Toto a small one containing medicines and bandages. Part of the food was for their own lunch, as they had a long walk before them, and would not be back till long past dinner-time. They trudged briskly along,--Toto whistling merrily as usual, but his companion very grave and silent. \"What ails you, old fellow?\" asked the boy, when a couple of miles had been traversed in this manner. \"Has our account of the wedding made you pine with envy, and wish yourself a mouse?\" \"No!\" replied the bear, slowly, \"oh, no! I should not like to be a mouse, or anything of that sort. But I do wish, Toto, that I was not so frightfully ugly!\" \"Ugly!\" cried Toto, indignantly, \"who said you",

She listened, with exclamations of pity and concern, to Cracker's account of the poor old hermit, and agreed with Bruin that aid must be sent to him without delay. \"I will pack a basket at once,\" she said, \"with nourishing food, bandages for the broken leg, and some simple medicines; and Toto, you will take it to the poor man, will you not, dear?\" \"Of course I will!\" said Toto, heartily. But Bruin said: \"No, dear Madam! I will go myself. Our Toto's heart is big, but he is not strong enough to take care of a sick person. It is surely best for me to go.\" The grandmother hesitated. \"Dear Bruin,\" she said, \"of course you _would_ be the best nurse on many accounts; but if the man is weak and nervous, I am afraid--you alarmed him once, you know, and possibly the sight of you, coming in suddenly, might--\" \"Speak out, Granny!\" cried Toto, laughing. \"You think Bruin would simply frighten the man to death, or at best into a fit; and you are quite right.

And he wouldn't come in yet if I were to--\" \"Cut him into inch pieces!\" came rolling like muffled thunder through the doorway. The old hermit started as if he had been shot. \"Ah! what is that?\" he cried. \"Boy! boy! who--_what_ is that speaking?\" \"Oh, dear!\" cried Toto, distractedly. \"Oh, dear! what shall I do? Please don't be alarmed, Mr. Baldhead--I mean, Mr. Hermit. He is the best, dearest, kindest old fellow _in the world_, and it isn't his fault, because he was--\" \"Born so!\" resounded from without; and the poor hermit, now speechless with terror, could only gasp, and gaze at Toto with eyes of agonized entreaty. \"Yes, he was born so!\" continued the boy. \"And we might have been bears ourselves, you know, if we had happened to have them for fathers and mothers; so--\" But here he paused in dismay, for the hermit, without more ado, quietly fainted away.",

Now, I confess I do not see _how_ a pig's tail could be worn on the head, or how it could be unbraided; that is, if the Chinese pigs have tails like that of our friend in the sty yonder.\" Toto laughed aloud at this, and even the grandmother could not help smiling a very little; but she gently told Bruin what a Chinaman's pig-tail was, and how he wore it. Meantime, Miss Mary, the parrot, looked on with an air of dignified amusement. \"My respected father,\" she",

Toto! come in, both of you. Mr. Hermit understands all about it now, and is ready to welcome _both_ his visitors.\" Much amazed, the two friends rose, and slowly and hesitatingly re-entered the cave, the bear making more desperate efforts even than before to conceal his colossal bulk. To his astonishment, however, the hermit, who was now lying propped up by an improvised pillow of dry moss, greeted him with an unflinching gaze, and even smiled and held out his hand. \"Mr. Bruin,\" he said, \"I am glad to meet you, sir! This sweet bird has told me all about you, and I am sincerely pleased to make your acquaintance. So you have walked ten miles and more to bring help and comfort to an old man who stole your honey!\" But this was more than the good bear could stand. He sat down on the ground, and thrusting his great shaggy paws into his eyes, fairly began to blubber. At this, I am ashamed to say, all the others fell to laughing. First, Toto laughed--but Toto, bless him! was always laughing; and then Pigeon Pretty laughed; and then Jim Crow;",
