  "gold_answer": "Bode was highly regarded in Hamburg, edited the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' which reviewed 'Tristram Shandy', and published 'Yorick's Briefe an Eliza' in Hamburg.",
  "llm_answer": "The Hamburg literary scene demonstrates Johann Joachim Christoph Bode's involvement in both literary criticism and publication. \n\nEvidence of his involvement in literary criticism includes:\n\n- His role as a reviewer of the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent', which reviewed 'Tristram Shandy'. Although the review's attitude towards Sterne is one of disbelief, it still indicates Bode's awareness of international literary conditions and his acquaintance with the English original of 'Tristram Shandy' before 1764.\n\nEvidence of his involvement in publication includes:\n\n- His publication of 'Yorick's Briefe an Eliza' in Hamburg in 1775. This publication is attributed to Bode by contemporary reviewers and internal evidence, including a translator's preface in the third volume of the collection, where Bode expresses his desire to translate Sterne's writings into German.",

      "text": "The writer is evidently compelled, as representative of British literary interests, to bear witness to the Shandy craze, but the attitude of the review is plainly indicative of its author’s disbelief in any occasion for especial concern about Yorick in Germany. Sterne himself is mentioned as a fitful whim of British taste, and a German devotion to him is beyond the flight of fancy.[30] Individual authors, aware of international literary conditions, the inner circle of German culture, became acquainted with Tristram Shandy during this period before the publication of the Sentimental Journey and learned to esteem the eccentric parson. Bode’s possible acquaintance with the English original previous to 1764 has been already noted. Lessing’s admiration for Sterne naturally is associated with his two statements of remarkable devotion to Yorick, both of which, however, date from a period when he had already become acquainted with the Journey. At precisely what time Lessing first read Tristram Shandy it is impossible to determine with accuracy. Moses Mendelssohn writes to him in the summer of 1763:[31] “Tristram Shandy is a work of masterly originality. At present, to be sure, I have read only the first two volumes. In the beginning the book vexed me exceedingly. I rambled on from digression to digression without grasping the real humor of the author. I regarded him as a man like our",

This journal may further be taken as an example of those which devoted a remarkable amount of space to British affairs, since it was published in the North German seaport town, where the mercantile connection with Britain readily fostered the exchange of other than purely commercial commodities. And yet in Hamburg Sterne waited full two years for a scanty recognition even of his English fame. In the fourth year after the English publication of Shandy comes the first attempt to transplant Sterne’s gallery of originals to German shores. This effort, of rather dubious success, is the Zückert translation of Tristram Shandy, a rendering weak and inaccurate, but nevertheless an important first step in the German Shandy cult. Johann Friedrich Zückert,[7] the translator, was born December 19, 1739, and died in Berlin May 1, 1778. He studied medicine at the University of Frankfurt an der Oder, became a physician in Berlin, but, because of bodily disabilities, devoted himself rather to study and society than to the practice of his profession. His publications are fairly numerous and deal principally with medical topics, especially with the question of foods. In the year after the appearance of his Shandy translation, Zückert published an essay which indicates the direction of his tastes and gives a clue to",

In this note Bode’s identity is evident in the following quotation: He says he has translated the letters “because I believe that they will be read with pleasure, and because I fancy I have a kind of vocation to give in German everything that Sterne has written, or whatever has immediate relation to his writings.” This note is dated Hamburg, September 16, 1775.
