  "question": "How did the events involving the Sioux influence Minnesota’s military mobilization?",
  "gold_answer": "The Sioux were rebellious against Gen. Sibley, and after the United States gained land from them, Minnesota was called upon to furnish the Sixth regiment.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, it appears that the events involving the Sioux did influence Minnesota's military mobilization, but the influence was indirect.\n\nThe Sioux Outbreak in 1862 led to a significant increase in military activity in Minnesota. The government was \"illy prepared to cope with an outbreak of such magnitude as this soon proved to be\" (Novel-10146_c_42). The outbreak led to the need for the military to transport supplies to the troops on the frontier, which was a challenging task due to the lack of railroads. The military authorities had to issue orders to impress teams and horses into service, and a detachment of Company K of the Eighth regiment was sent to the city to enforce this order (Novel-10146_c_63).\n\nAdditionally, the Sioux Outbreak led to the execution of two Sioux chiefs, Little Six and Medicine Bottle, who were involved in the outbreak (Novel-10146_c_63). This event may have had a psychological impact on the Sioux population and potentially contributed to the escalation of the conflict.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the provided evidence does not directly link the Sioux Outbreak to the mobilization of Minnesota's military in response to the Civil War. The mobilization efforts mentioned in the evidence appear to be related to the war effort in general, rather than specifically to the Sioux Outbreak.\n\nIn summary, the events involving the Sioux did influence Minnesota's military mobilization, but the influence was indirect and related to the need for military activity in response to the outbreak, rather than a direct response to the Civil War.",

NARRATION OF SOME OF THE EXCITING EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862--FORT RIDGELY, NEW ULM AND BIRCH COULIE--OTHER DAY AND WABASHA--GREAT EXCITEMENT IN ST. PAUL. In July and August, 1862, President Lincoln issued proclamations calling for the enlistment of 600,000 volunteers for the purpose of reinforcing the army, then vainly endeavoring to suppress the Southern rebellion. It was probably one of the most gloomy periods in the history of the Civil war.",

Little Six and Medicine Bottle, two Sioux chiefs engaged in the outbreak, were arrested at Fort Gary (Winnipeg), and delivered at Pembina in January, 1864, and were afterward taken to Fort Snelling, where they were tried, condemned and executed in the presence of 10,000 people, being the last of the Indians to receive capital punishment for their great crimes. Little Six confessed to having murdered fifty white men, women and children. One of the most perplexing problems the military authorities had to contend with was the transportation of supplies to the troops on the frontier. There were, of course, no railroads, and the only way to transport provisions was by wagon. An order was issued by the military authorities requesting the tender of men and teams for this purpose, but the owners of draft horses did not respond with sufficient alacrity to supply the pressing necessities of the army, and it was necessary for the authorities to issue another order forcibly impressing into service of the government any and all teams that could be found on the streets or in stables. A detachment of Company K of the Eighth regiment was sent down from the fort and remained in the city several days on that especial duty. As soon as the farmers heard that the government was taking possession of everything that came over the bridge they ceased hauling their produce to the city and carried it to Hastings.

Nearly 250 miles of road were graded, on which the state foreclosed and a few years later donated the same to new organizations. During the administration of Gov. Pillsbury the state compromised with the holders of these securities and paid 50 per cent of their nominal value. Will she ever pay the rest? In the latter part of May, 1858, a battle was fought near Shakopee between the Sioux and the Chippewas. A party of Chippewa warriors, under the command of the famous Chief Hole-in-the-day, surprised a body of Sioux on the river bottoms near Shakopee and mercilessly opened fire on them, killing and wounding fifteen or twenty. Eight or ten Chippewas were killed during the engagement. The daily papers sent reporters to the scene of the conflict and they remained in that vicinity several days on the lookout for further engagements. Among the reporters was John W. Sickels, a fresh young man from one of the Eastern cities. He was attached to the Times' editorial staff and furnished that paper with a very graphic description of the events of the preceding days, and closed his report by saying that he was unable to find out the \"origin of the difficulty.\" As the Sioux and Chippewas were hereditary enemies, his closing announcement afforded considerable amusement to the old inhabitants.

It was during this critical period in the great struggle for the suppression of the Rebellion that one of the most fiendish atrocities in the history of Indian warfare was enacted on the western boundaries of Minnesota. It can readily be seen that the government was illy prepared to cope with an outbreak of such magnitude as this soon proved to be. By the terms of the treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 the Sioux sold all their lands in Minnesota, except a strip ten miles wide on each side of the Minnesota river from near Fort Ridgely to Big Stone lake. In 1858 ten miles of the strip lying north of the river was sold, mainly through the influence of Little Crow. The selling of this strip caused great dissatisfaction among the Indians and Little Crow was severely denounced for the part he took in the transaction. The sale rendered it necessary for all the Indians to locate on the south side of the Minnesota, where game was scarce and trapping poor. There was nothing for them to live upon unless they adopted the habits of civilization and worked like white men. This was very distasteful to many of them, as they wanted to live the same as they did before the treaty--go where they pleased, when they pleased, and hunt game and sell fur to traders. The government built houses for those who desired to occupy them, furnished tools, seed, etc., and taught",

For three months after this battle Capt. Shelly's company was engaged in protecting the long line of railroad from Columbus, Ky., to Corinth, Miss. On the 25th of August, 1862, Fort Donalson was attacked by the rebels and this regiment was ordered to its relief. This attack of the rebels did not prove to be very serious, but on the 5th of February, 1863, the rebels under Forrest and Wheeler made a third attack on Fort Donelson. They were forced to retire, leaving a large number of their dead on the field, but fortunately none of the men under Capt. Shelly were injured. Nearly the entire spring and summer of 1863 was spent in scouring the country in the vicinity of the Tennessee river, sometimes on guard duty, sometimes on the picket line and often in battle. They were frequently days and nights without food or sleep, but ever kept themselves in readiness for an attack from the wily foes. Opposed to them were the commands of Forest and Wheeler, the very best cavalry officers in the Confederate service. A number of severe actions ended in the battle of Chickamauga, in which the First cavalry took a prominent part.
