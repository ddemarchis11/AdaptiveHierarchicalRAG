  "gold_answer": "The spine is made of bones; bones bend easily in children, who are always out-growing shoes.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n1. In the narrative's exploration of skeletal structure and childhood development, the spine is described in terms of its composition as being made up of \"little bones with cushions between them.\" These cushions are made of \"gristle\" and are elastic, allowing the spine to bend easily.\n\n2. The characteristics of children's bones and growth highlighted in the narrative include:\n- Children's bones have more gristle than those of older people, making them bend easily.\n- Children's bones are more prone to bending and twisting, which can lead to injuries such as being lame.\n- Children's bones are more flexible and can be easily bent, but may not easily spring back into shape if bent too far.\n- Children's bones are more likely to grow crooked if they stand unevenly.\n- Children's bones are more prone to breaking as they age, due to the increased amount of lime in their bones.\n\n3. The ease with which bones bend is highlighted as a characteristic of children's bones, making them more prone to injuries such as being lame. The narrative also mentions that children's bones are more likely to grow crooked if they stand unevenly.\n\n4. The tendency for children to outgrow their shoes is highlighted as a characteristic of childhood development. The narrative states that \"Healthy children are always out-growing their shoes, and sometimes faster than they wear them out.\" Tight shoes can cause problems such as corns and in-growing nails, and it is recommended that no one should wear a shoe that pinches or hurts the foot.",

Children's bones have more gristle than those of older people; so children's bones bend easily. I know a lady who has one leg shorter than the other. This makes her lame, and she has to wear a boot with iron supports three or four inches high, in order to walk at all. One day she told me how she became lame. \"I remember,\" she said, \"when I was between three and four years old, sitting one day in my high chair at the table, and twisting one foot under the little step of the chair. The next morning I felt lame; but nobody could tell what was the matter. At last, the doctors found out that the trouble all came from that twist. It had gone too far to be cured. Before I had this boot, I could only walk with a crutch.\" CARE OF THE SPINE. Because the spine is made of little bones with cushions between them, it bends easily, and children sometimes bend it more than they ought. If you lean over your book or your writing or any other work, the elastic cushions may get so pressed on the inner edge that they do not easily spring back into shape. In this way, you may grow round-shouldered or hump-backed. This bending over, also",

What parts of our bodies are jointed together so nicely? Our bones. How many bones have we? If you should count all your bones, you would find that each of you has about two hundred. Some are large; and some, very small. There are long-hones in your legs and arms, and many short ones in your fingers and toes. The backbone is called the spine. [Illustration: _Backbone of a fish._] If you look at the backbone of a fish, you can see that it is made up-of many little bones. Your own spine is formed in much the same way, of twenty-four small bones. An elastic cushion of gristle (gr[)i]s'l) fits nicely in between each little bone and the next. When you bend, these cushions are pressed together on one side and stretched on the other. They settle back into their first shape, as soon as you stand straight again. If you ever rode in a wheelbarrow, or a cart without springs, you know what a jolting it gave you. These little spring cushions keep you from being shaken even more severely every time you move. Twenty-four ribs, twelve on each side, curve around from the spine to the front, or breast, bone. (_See page 38._) They are",

This bending over, also cramps the lungs, so that they do not have all the room they need for breathing. While you are young, your bones are easily bent. One shoulder or one hip gets higher than the other, if you stand unevenly. This is more serious, because you are growing, and you may grow crooked before you know it. Now that you know how soft your bones are, and how easily they bend, you will surely be careful to sit and stand erect. Do not twist your legs, or arms, or shoulders; for you want to grow into straight and graceful men and women, instead of being round-shouldered, or hump-backed, or lame, all your lives. When people are old, their bones contain more lime, and, therefore, break more easily. You should be kindly helpful to old people, so that they may not fall, and possibly break their bones. CARE OF THE FEET. Healthy children are always out-growing their shoes, and sometimes faster than they wear them out. Tight shoes cause corns and in-growing nails and other sore places on the feet. All of these are very hard to get rid of. No one should wear a shoe that pinches or hurts the foot. OUGHT A BOY TO USE TOBACCO? Perhaps some boy will say: \"Grown people are",
