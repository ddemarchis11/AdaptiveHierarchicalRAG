Mr. Greenman kept the hotel for some time, and then sold it to John Summers, who was the owner of it when it was burned. The Merchants is the only one of the old hotels still existing, and that only in name, as the original structure was torn down to make room for the present building many years ago. Aside from the hotel fires one of the most appalling calamities that ever occurred at a fire in St. Paul took place in May, 1870, when the old Concert Hall building on Third street, near Market, was destroyed. Concert Hall was built by the late J.W. McClung in 1857, and the hall in the basement was one of the largest in the city. The building was three stories high in front and six or seven on the river side. It was located about twenty-five feet back from the sidewalk. Under the sidewalk all kinds of inflamable material was stored and it was from here that the fire was first noticed. In an incredibly short time flames reached the top of the building, thus making escape almost impossible. On the river side of the building on the top floor two brothers, Charles and August Mueller, had a tailor shop. The fire spread so rapidly that the building was completely enveloped in flames before they even thought their lives were endangered. In",

The Canada house and the Galena house, two small frame structures on Robert near Third, were the next hotels to be visited by the fiery element. These hotels, though small, were well patronized at the time of their destruction. On the 16th of March, 1860, the most destructive fire that had ever occurred in St. Paul broke out in a small wooden building on Third street near Jackson, and though the entire fire department--three engines and one truck, manned by one hundred men--were promptly on hand, the flames rapidly got beyond their reach. Nearly all the buildings on Third street at that time from Robert to Jackson were two-story frame structures, and in their rear were small houses occupied by the owners of the stores. When the fire was at its height it was feared that the whole of lower town would be destroyed before the flames could be subdued, but by dint of superhuman effort the firemen managed to cut off the leap across Robert street and soon had the immense smouldering mass under control. Thirty-four buildings, the largest number ever destroyed in St. Paul, were in ashes. Of the two blocks which lined the north and south sides of Third street above Jackson, only three buildings were left standing, two being stone structures occupied by Beaumont & Gordon and",

In 1861 Peter and Caroline Richings spent a part of the summer in St. Paul, and local amusement lovers were delightfully entertained by these celebrities during their sojourn. During the war a number of dramatic and musical performances were given at the Athenaeum for the boys in blue. The cantata of \"The Haymakers,\" for the benefit of the sanitary commission made quite a hit, and old residents will recollect Mrs. Winne, Mrs. Blakeley and Prof. Perkins, who took the leading parts. Prof. Phil Roher and Otto Dreher gave dramatic performances both in German and English for some time after the close of the war. Plunkett's Dramatic company, with Susan Denin as the star, filled the boards at this hall a short time before the little old opera house was constructed on Wabasha street. During the Sioux massacre a large number of maimed refugees were brought to the city and found temporary shelter in this place. In 1853 Market hall, on the corner of Wabasha and Seventh streets, was built, and it was one of the principal places of amusement. The Hough Dramatic company, with Bernard, C.W. Couldock, Sallie St. Clair and others were among the notable performers who entertained theatergoers. In 1860 the Wide Awakes used this place for a drill hall, and so proficient did the",

Mr. Munger assured his friend that he thought it would make a great hit, and he financially assisted Mr. Emmet in placing it before the public. One of the first copies printed was sent to Mr. Munger, and the first time this celebrated composition was ever sung in the West was in the music store of Munger Bros, in the old concert hall building on Third street. \"Dixie\" at once became very popular, and was soon on the program of every minstrel troupe in the country. Dan Emmet devoted his whole life to minstrelsy and he organized the first traveling minstrel troupe in the United States, starting from some point in Ohio in 1843. The father of the Emmets was a gallant soldier of the War of 1812, and at one time lived in the old brown frame house at the intersection of Ramsey and West Seventh streets, recently demolished. A correspondent of one of the magazines gives the following account of how \"Dixie\" happened to become the national air of the Confederate States: \"Early in the war a spectacular performance was being given in New Orleans. Every part had been filled, and all that was lacking was a march and war song for the grand chorus. A great many marches",

Very few of the 200,000 inhabitants of St. Paul are aware that the three-story, three-cornered building on Third street at Seven Corners once contained one of the most popular amusement halls in the city. It was called Irvine hall, and at one time Melodeon hall. Dan Emmet had a minstrel company at this hall during the years 1857 and 1858, and an excellent company it was, too. There was Frank Lombard, the great baritone; Max Irwin, bones, and one of the funniest men who ever sat on the stage; Johnny Ritter, female impersonator and clog dancer, and a large number of others.

The building had just been finished and furnished for occupancy. A strong wind was raging and the little band of firemen were unable to save the structure. The names of Rev. D.D. Neill, Isaac Markley, Bartlett Presley and W.M. Stees were among the firemen who assisted in saving the furniture. The Sintominie hotel on the corner of Sixth and John streets, was the second hotel to receive a visit from the fire king. This hotel was constructed by the late C.W. Borup, and it was the pride of lower town. Howard Ward and E.C. Rich were preparing to open it when the fire occurred. Owing to the lack of fire protection the building was totally destroyed. Early in the winter of 1856 the Rice house, commonly supposed to be the first brick building erected in St. Paul, was burned to the ground. It was three stories high, and when in process of building was considered a visionary enterprise. The building was constructed by Henry M. Rice, and he spared no expense to make it as complete as the times would allow. It was situated on Third street near Market, and in the early days was considered St. Paul's principal hotel.
