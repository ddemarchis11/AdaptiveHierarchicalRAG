  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, it appears that there is no direct link between consuming candy and the presence of alcohol in the body. However, there is a mention of how sugar can be converted into fat, and how fat can be converted into alcohol.\n\nAccording to the text, sugar can be converted into fat, and fat can be converted into alcohol. This process is not explicitly stated to occur in the human body, but rather in the context of food production and fermentation.\n\nIn the chapter on alcohol, it is mentioned that grapes contain water, sugar, and flavor, and that when the juice is squeezed out and left standing, bubbles begin to rise and cover the top with froth. This is a description of the fermentation process, where the natural yeast on the grapes converts the sugars into alcohol.\n\nHowever, there is no direct link between consuming candy and the presence of alcohol in the body. The text does not provide any information on how sugar from candy can be converted into alcohol in the human body.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that there is no direct link between consuming candy and the presence of alcohol in the body, based on the provided evidence.",

There is a simple way by which you can find this out for yourselves. If you put a spoonful of sugar into a tumbler of water, it will all dissolve and disappear. Put a piece of white candy into a tumbler of water; and, if it is made of pure sugar only, it will dissolve and disappear. If it is not, you will find at the bottom of the tumbler some white earth. This is not good food for anybody. Candy-makers often put it into candy in place of sugar, because it is cheaper than sugar. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. Why do we need food?           2.

WHAT WILL MAKE FAT? Sugar will make fat, and so will starch, cream, rice, butter, and fat meat. As milk will make muscle and fat and bones, it is the best kind of food. Here, again, it is the earth that sends us our food. Fat meat comes from animals well fed on grain and grass; sugar, from sugar-cane, maple-trees, or beets; oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and starch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and other grains. Green apples and other unripe fruits are not yet ready to be eaten. The starch which we take for food has to be changed into sugar, before it can mix with the blood and help feed the body. As the sun ripens fruit, it changes its starch to sugar. You can tell this by the difference in the taste of ripe and unripe apples. CANDY.

This juice is mostly water, sweetened with a sugar of its own. It is flavored with something which makes us know, the moment we taste it, that it is grape-juice, and not cherry-juice or plum-juice. Apples also contain water, sugar, and apple flavor; and cherries contain water, sugar, and cherry flavor. The same is true of other fruits. They all, when ripe, have the water and the sugar; and each has a flavor of its own. Ripe grapes are sometimes gathered and put into great tubs called vats. In these the juice is squeezed out. In some countries, this squeezing is done by bare-footed men who jump into the vats and press the grapes with their feet. The grape-juice is then drawn off from the skins and seeds and left standing in a warm place. Bubbles soon begin to rise and cover the top of it with froth. The juice is all in motion.
