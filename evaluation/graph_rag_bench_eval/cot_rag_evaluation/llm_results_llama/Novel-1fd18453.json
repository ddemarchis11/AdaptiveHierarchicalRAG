He drew back from the girl in his arms and looked anxiously and feelingly at her lover. \"How could you, Ellen,\" he said, \"how could you?\" He was watching the young man's face with eyes full of sympathy and concern. \"How little you know him,\" he said, \"how little you understand. He will not do that,\" he added quickly, but looking questioningly at Latimer and speaking in a tone almost of command. \"He will not undo all that he has done; I know him better than that.\" But Latimer made no answer, and for a moment the two men stood watching each other and questioning each other with their eyes. Then Latimer turned, and without again so much as glancing at the girl walked steadily to the door and left the room. He passed on slowly down the stairs and out into the night, and paused upon the top of the steps leading to the street. Below him lay the avenue with its double line of lights stretching off in two long perspectives. The lamps of hundreds of cabs and carriages flashed as they advanced toward him and shone for a moment at the turnings of the cross-streets, and from either",

You love her and you would do everything to make the life of the woman you love a happy one; but this is it, Can you assure me that there is nothing in the past that may reach forward later and touch my daughter through you--no ugly story, no oats that have been sowed, and no boomerang that you have thrown wantonly and that has not returned--but which may return?\" \"I think I understand you now, sir,\" said the young man, quietly. \"I have lived,\" he began, \"as other men of my sort have lived. You know what that is, for you must have seen it about you at college, and after that before you entered the Church. I judge so from your friends, who were your friends then, I understand. You know how they lived. I never went in for dissipation, if you mean that, because it never attracted me. I am afraid I kept out of it not so much out of respect for others as for respect for myself. I found my self-respect was a very good thing to keep, and I rather preferred keeping it and losing several pleasures that other men managed to enjoy, apparently with free consciences. I confess I used to rather envy them. It is no particular virtue on my part; the thing struck me as rather more vulgar than",

Can I risk that?\" \"But I tell you it is impossible,\" cried the young man. \"The woman is beyond the love of any man, at least such a man as I am, or try to be.\" \"Do you mean,\" asked the bishop, gently, and with an eager look of hope, \"that she is dead?\" Latimer faced the father for some seconds in silence. Then he raised his head slowly. \"No,\" he said, \"I do not mean she is dead. No, she is not dead.\" Again the bishop moved back wearily into his chair. \"You mean then,\" he said, \"perhaps, that she is a married woman?\" Latimer pressed his lips together at first as though he would not answer, and then raised his eyes coldly. \"Perhaps,\" he said. The older man had held up his hand as if to signify that what he was about to say should be listened to without interruption, when a sharp turning of the lock of the door caused both father and the suitor to start.

It would have been so easy to have said, 'For thirty days or for life Ellen is the only woman who has the power to make me happy.' You see that would have answered me and satisfied me. But you did not say that,\" he added, quickly, as the young man made a movement as if to speak. \"Well, and suppose this other woman did exist, what then?\" demanded Latimer. \"The conditions you suggest are impossible; you must, you will surely, sir, admit that.\" \"I do not know,\" replied the bishop, sadly; \"I do not know.
