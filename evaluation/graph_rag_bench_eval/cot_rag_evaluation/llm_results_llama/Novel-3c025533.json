      "text": "London Times_. HOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN. [Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia.] By PROFESSOR L. M. HAUPT. INTRODUCTORY. The discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been of inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters, and the explorer over desert wastes. In these, its legitimate uses, the needle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate determination of permanent boundary lines have proven very unsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and even death. For these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to dispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle in surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of traversing from a true meridian. This method, however, involves a greater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are generally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be readily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application in practice. Much has been written upon the various methods of determining, the true meridian, but it is so intimately related to the determination of latitude and time, and these latter in turn upon the fixing of a true meridian, that the novice can find neither beginning nor end. When to these difficulties are added the corrections for parallax,",

The result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for ordinary purposes. The time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens. The refraction is _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by looking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude. Thus, if the observer's altitude should be 40 deg. 39' the nearest refraction 01' 07\", should be subtracted from 40 deg. 37' 00\", leaving 40 deg. 37' 53\" for the latitude. TO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS. As we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the latitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the required azimuth. For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical triangle, Z S P, Fig. 4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the north pole, and S is Polaris. In this triangle we have given the polar distance, P S = 10 deg. 19' 13\"; the angle at S = 90 deg.; and the distance Z P, being the complement of the latitude",

The latter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude referred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates. The _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator, and the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian. We are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to the latitude of the place of observation_. Let H P Z Q1, etc., Fig. 2, represent a meridian section of the sphere, in which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H1 will be the horizon, Q Q1 the equator, H P will be the altitude of P, and Q1 Z the latitude of Z. These two arcs are equal, for H C Z = P C Q1 = 90 deg., and if from these equal quadrants the common angle P C Z be subtracted, the remainders H C P and Z C Q1, will be equal. To _determine the altitude of the pole_, or, in other words, _the latitude of the place_.

When the line joining these two stars is horizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the latter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and _vice versa_, thus: [Illustration] But since the star at either elongation is off the meridian, it will be necessary to determine the angle at the place of observation to be turned off on the instrument to bring it into the meridian. This angle, called the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the observer, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be computed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his _latitude_ before he can apply it. Let N be the north pole of the celestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation; then N S=1 deg. 19' 13\", a constant quantity. The azimuth of Polaris at the latitude 40 deg. north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60 deg. north, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle of the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the latitude. We have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_. Of the several methods for doing this,",

Having received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I have thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the method of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently clear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make use of such information. This will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with the DEFINITIONS. The _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all celestial objects are projected. Its radius is infinite. The _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves. The _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the earth, or of the celestial sphere. A _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing through the axis. All meridians are therefore north and south lines",

      "text": "APPLICATIONS. In practice to find the true meridian, two observations must be made at intervals of six hours, or they may be made upon different nights. The first is for latitude, the second for azimuth at elongation. To make either, the surveyor should provide himself with a good transit with vertical arc, a bull's eye, or hand lantern, plumb bobs, stakes, etc.[1] Having \"set up\" over the point through which it is proposed to establish the meridian, at a time when the line joining Polaris and Alioth is nearly vertical, level the telescope by means of the attached level, which should be in adjustment, set the vernier of the vertical arc at zero, and take the reading. If the pole star is about making its _upper_ transit, it will rise gradually until reaching the meridian as it moves westward, and then as gradually descend. When near the highest part of its orbit point the telescope at the star, having an assistant to hold the \"bull's eye\" so as to reflect enough light down the tube from the object end to illumine the cross wires but not to obscure the star, or better, use a perforated silvered reflector, clamp the tube in this position, and as the star continues to rise keep the _horizontal_ wire upon it by means of the tangent screw until it \"rides\" along this wire and finally begins to fall below it.
