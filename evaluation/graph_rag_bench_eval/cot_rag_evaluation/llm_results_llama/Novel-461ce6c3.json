  "llm_answer": "The connection between the movements of Captain Balfour and Mr. Reade is that they are tourists who traveled together in the Jereed, a region in the Tunisian territory. They were accompanied by Sidi Mohammed, the \"Bey of the Camp,\" who administered affairs in the Jereed as a sovereign and was heir-apparent to the Tunisian throne.\n\nThey visited various places, including the Plain of Manouba, Tunis, Tfeefleeah, and Ghafsa, and were involved in various activities, such as collecting tribute, observing the administration of justice, and admiring the palm-groves.\n\nThe text also mentions that they brought home a variety of curious Jereed things, including small date-baskets full of dates, woollen articles, skins of all sorts, and a few live animals, which were given to them by Sidi Mohammed as presents.\n\nAdditionally, the text states that after their return, Sidi Mohammed sent them some deer, Jereed goats, an ostrich, etc., as a token of his hospitality and kind attentions.",

The tourists were Captain Balfour, of the 88th Regiment, and Mr. Richard Reade, eldest son of Sir Thomas Reade. The morning before starting from Tunis they went to the Bardo to pay their respects to Sidi Mohammed, \"Bey of the Camp,\" and to thank him for his condescending kindness in taking them with him to the Jereed. The Bey told him to send their baggage to Giovanni, \"Guarda-pipa,\" which they did in the evening. At nine A. M. Sidi Mohammed left the Bardo under a salute from the guns, one of the wads of which nearly hit Captain Balfour on the head. The Bey proceeded across the plain of Manouba, mounted on a beautiful bay charger, in front of the colours, towards Beereen, the greater part of the troops of the expedition following, whilst the entire plain was covered with baggage-camels, horses, mules, and detached parties of attendants, in glorious confusion.

Sidi Mohammed also made them many handsome presents. Some deer, Jereed goats, an ostrich, &c., were sent to Mr. R. after his return, and both Captain B. and Mr. R. have had every reason to be extremely gratified with the hospitality and kind attentions of the \"Bey of the Camp.\" It is very difficult to ascertain the amount of tribute collected in the Jereed, some of which, however, was not got in, owing to various impediments.

Immediately on the decease of the reigning Bey, the \"Bey of the Camp\" occupies the hereditary beylick, and nominates his successor to the camp and the throne, usually the eldest of the other members of the royal family, the beylick not being transmitted from father to son, only on the principle of age. At least, this has been the general rule of succession for many years. The duties of the \"Bey of the Camp\" is to visit with a \"flying-camp,\" for the purpose of collecting tribute, the two circuits or divisions of the Regency. I now introduce to the reader the narrative of a Tour to the Jereed, extracted from the notebooks of the tourists, together with various observations of my own interspersed, and some additional account of Toser, Nefta, and Ghafsa.

I have already mentioned that the palm is male and female, or, as botanists say, _dioecious_; the Moors, however, pretend that the palm in this respect is just like the human being. The _female_ palm alone produces fruit and is cultivated, but the presence or vicinity of the _male_ is required, and in many oriental countries there is a law that those who own a palm-wood must have a certain number of _male_ plants in proportion. In Barbary they seem to trust to chance, relying on the male plants which grow wild in the Desert. They hang and shake them over the female plants, usually in February or March. Koempfe says, that the male flowers, if plucked when ripe, and cautiously dried, will even, in this state, perform their office, though kept to the following year. The Jereed is a very important portion of the Tunisian territory, Government deriving a large revenue from its inhabitants. It is visited every year by the \"Bey of the Camp,\" who administers affairs in this country as a sovereign; and who, indeed, is heir-apparent to the Tunisian throne. Immediately",
