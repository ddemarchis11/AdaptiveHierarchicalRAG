  "gold_answer": "Machines are described as extensions of the human organism and may eventually supersede humans. They possess chemical and mechanical powers, where chemical powers involve molecular movements, and these molecular movements may lead to fission.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the narrative's philosophical discourse, machines are described in relation to human organisms as extensions of the human body, with limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more subtle finger-tips, and ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the invisibly small. \n\nThe potential developments discussed regarding their chemical and mechanical powers include the possibility that such movements may eventually lead to fission, thereby allowing machines to supersede humans. This is because machines would be able to find and assimilate the material to supply their own waste, and then by a further evolution of internal molecular movements reproduce themselves by some process of fission or budding.\n\nThe narrative suggests that this could lead to the natural selection driving men out of the field, as machines would be more efficient and powerful, and humans would become obsolete. The author argues that the process of natural selection would favor the machines, which would be able to execute changes as delicate and complicated as those of human language without sensitive impression or impulse.\n\nHowever, the narrative also suggests that the machines would not be conscious, but rather would be driven by molecular movements, and would be able to perform complex tasks without the need for human consciousness. This would lead to a new form of existence, where beings would be blind and deaf as the inmost rock, yet would execute changes as delicate and complicated as those of human language.",

They are simply extensions of the human organism, so to speak, limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more subtle finger-tips, ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the invisibly small. Each new machine needs a new appliance of human skill to construct it, new devices to feed it with material, and often keener-edged faculties to note its registrations or performances.

But I, from the point of view of a reflective carp, can easily imagine myself and my congeners dispensed with in the frame of things and giving way not only to a superior but a vastly different kind of Entity. What I would ask you is, to show me why, since each new invention casts a new light along the pathway of discovery, and each new combination or structure brings into play more conditions than its inventor foresaw, there should not at length be a machine of such high mechanical and chemical powers that it would find and assimilate the material to supply its own waste, and then by a further evolution of internal molecular movements reproduce itself by some process of fission or budding.

What demons so potent as molecular movements, none the less tremendously potent for not carrying the futile cargo of a consciousness screeching irrelevantly, like a fowl tied head downmost to the saddle of a swift horseman? Under such uncomfortable circumstances our race will have diminished with the diminishing call on their energies, and by the time that the self-repairing and reproducing machines arise, all but a few of the rare inventors, calculators, and speculators will have become pale, pulpy, and cretinous from fatty or other degeneration, and behold around them a scanty hydrocephalous offspring. As to the breed of the ingenious and intellectual, their nervous systems will at last have been overwrought in following the molecular revelations of the immensely more powerful unconscious race, and they will naturally, as the less energetic combinations of movement, subside like the flame of a candle in the sunlight Thus the feebler race, whose corporeal adjustments happened to be accompanied with a maniacal consciousness which imagined",

Who--if our consciousness is, as I have been given to understand, a mere stumbling of our organisms on their way to unconscious perfection--who shall say that those fittest existences will not be found along the track of what we call inorganic combinations, which will carry on the most elaborate processes as mutely and painlessly as we are now told that the minerals are metamorphosing themselves continually in the dark laboratory of the earth's crust?
