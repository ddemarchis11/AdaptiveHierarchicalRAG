  "gold_answer": "Fez has trade with Morocco and sends caravans to Timbuctoo.",
  "llm_answer": "The novel describes the commercial activities of Fez, including its trade with other parts of Morocco and its role as a departure point for caravans to Timbuctoo, within the broader African context as follows:\n\n- Fez is a major commercial center with a vast trade network, exhibiting goods from Europe, Africa, and the world.\n- The city has two annual caravans: one to Central Africa (Timbuctoo) and another to Mecca (caravan of pilgrims).\n- The journey from Fez to Timbuctoo takes about 90 days, while the Mecca caravan takes 4-6 months to reach Alexandria.\n- The value of investments in the caravan to Alexandria is estimated at a million dollars.\n- Fez's trade is extensive, with merchants from Mogador having magazines in the city and trading to the interior.\n- The city's manufactures include silks, embroidery, leather, and red caps (fez), which were first fabricated in Fez.\n- The city's trade is also influenced by its geographical location, with the Atlas mountains providing a temperate climate and access to the Sahara Desert.\n- Fez's trade is not limited to the African continent, with connections to Europe and the Middle East.\n\nIn the broader African context, Fez's trade is part of a larger network of commercial activities that connect the city to other parts of Morocco, the Sahara Desert, and the African continent. The city's role as a departure point for caravans to Timbuctoo highlights its importance in the trans-Saharan trade, which connected West Africa to the Mediterranean region.",

In the great square, called Al-Kaisseriah, is exhibited all the commerce of Europe and Africa--nay, even of the whole world. The crowd of traffickers here assemble every day as at a fair. Fez has two annual caravans; one leaves for Central Africa, or Timbuctoo; and another for Mecca, or the caravan of pilgrims. The two great stations and rendezvous points of the African caravan are Tafilett and Touat. The journey from Fez to Timbuctoo occupies about ninety days. The Mecca caravan proceeds the same route as far as Touat, and then turns bank north-east to Ghadames, Fezzan, and Angelah, and thence to Alexandria, which it accomplishes in four or five, to six months. All depends on the inclination of the Shereef, or Commandant, of the caravan; but the journey from Fez to Alexandria cannot, by the quickest caravan, be accomplished in much less time than three months and a half, or one hundred days. The value of the investments in this caravan has been estimated at a million of dollars; for the faithful followers of the Prophet believe, with us, that godliness is profitable in the life that now is, as well as in that which is to",

The manufactures of this, as of other large places, are principally, silks, embroidery, and leather. The merchants of Mogador have magazines here; this capital has also its caravans, which trade to the interior, passing through Wadnoun to the south. The Imperial palace is without the city and fortified with strong walls. There are large gardens attached, in one of which the Emperor receives his merchants and the diplomatic agents. The air of the country, at the foot of the Atlas, is pure and salubrious. The city is well supplied with water from an aqueduct, connecting it with the river Tensift, which flows from the gorges of the Atlas. But the inhabitants, although they enjoy this inestimable blessing in an African climate, are not famous for their cleanliness; Morocco, if possessing any particular character, still must be considered as a commercial city, for its learning is at a very low ebb.

I shall add a word or two on our treaties, or capitulations, as they are disgracefully called, with the Empire of Morocco, intimating, as they do, our former submission to the arrogant, piratical demands of the Barbary Powers in the days of their corsair glory. Our political relations with Morocco officially commenced in the times of Elizabeth, or Charles I; but the formal treaty of peace was not concluded until the last year of the reign of George I, which was ratified in 1729 by George II, and by the Sultan Muley Ahmed-elt-Thabceby \"The golden.\" Then followed various other treaties for the security of persons and trade, and against piracy.

We can understand why a people inhabiting a cold region of rain and mists and perpetual snow should wear boots; but as to their shaving like Christians, this is rather vague. But it is not impossible the Atlas contains the descendants of some European refugees. The nature of the soil and climate of Morocco are not unlike those of Spain and Portugal; and though Morocco does not materially differ from other parts of Barbary, its greater extent of coast on the Atlantic, along which the tradewind of the north coast blows nine months out of twelve, and its loftier ridges of the Atlas, so temper its varied surface of hill and plain and vast declivities that, together with the absence of those marshy districts which in hot climates engender fatal disease, this country may be pronounced, excepting perhaps Tunis, the most healthy in all Africa. In the northern provinces, the climate is nearly the same as that of Spain; in the southern there is less rain and more of the desert heat, but this is compensated for by the greater fertility in the production of valuable staple articles of commerce. Nevertheless, Morocco has its extremes of heat and cold, like all the North African coast.
