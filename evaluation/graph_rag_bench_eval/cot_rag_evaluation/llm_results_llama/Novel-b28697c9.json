  "question": "How might the use of alcohol affect the body's ability to move the chest, considering its impact on both muscles and the stomach?",
  "gold_answer": "Alcohol hurts the stomach and puts fat into muscles; muscles move the chest.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the use of alcohol might affect the body's ability to move the chest in the following ways:\n\n1. Alcohol changes a part of the muscles to fat, which takes away a part of their strength (Novel-25646_c_20). This could potentially weaken the muscles of the chest, making it harder to move the chest.\n2. Alcohol affects the nerves, which direct the muscular work of the chest (Novel-25646_c_82). This could potentially impair the nervous system's ability to control the muscles of the chest, making it harder to move the chest.\n3. The stomach's lining is affected by alcohol, which could potentially impair its ability to prepare gastric juice (Novel-25646_c_51). This could potentially affect the digestive process and the body's ability to absorb nutrients, which could indirectly affect the body's ability to move the chest.\n\nHowever, the evidence does not provide a direct link between alcohol consumption and the body's ability to move the chest. It is possible that the effects of alcohol on the muscles and nerves could indirectly affect the body's ability to move the chest, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided evidence.",

The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku lar) walls. Every time we breathe, these walls have to move. The muscles of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you breathe. All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is directed by the nerves. You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so you are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs. Is alcohol a help to them? REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1.

So idleness is an enemy to the muscles. There is another enemy to the muscles about which I must tell you. WHAT ALCOHOL WILL DO TO THE MUSCLES. Muscles are lean meat. Fat meat could not work your joints for you as the muscles do. Alcohol often changes a part of the muscles to fat, and so takes away a part of their strength. In this way, people often grow very fleshy from drinking beer, because it contains alcohol, as you will soon learn. But they can not work any better on account of having this fat. They are not really any stronger for it. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. How are the joints moved?           2.

You have learned about the twenty-four little bones in the spine, and the ribs that curve around from the spine to the front, or breast-bone. These bones, with the shoulder-blades and the collar-bones, form a bony case or box. In it are some of the most useful organs of the body. This box is divided across the middle by a strong muscle, so that we may say it is two stories high. The upper room is called the chest; the lower one, the abdomen ([)a]b d[=o]'m[)e]n). In the chest, are the heart and the lungs. In the abdomen, are the stomach, the liver, and some other organs. THE STOMACH. The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful a bag as could be made, you will say, when I tell you what it can do. The outside is made of muscles; the lining prepares a juice called gastric (g[)a]s'tr[)i]k) juice, and keeps it always ready for use.
