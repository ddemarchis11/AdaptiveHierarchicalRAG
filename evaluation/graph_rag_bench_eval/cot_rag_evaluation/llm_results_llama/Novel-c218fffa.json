      "text": "Hakka boat on opposite shore; a green flag and a rice-scoop hoisted at her mast; light a fire on the water-gate steps, and she will come quickly, day or night.--O.W.\" Heywood took the news coldly. He shook his head, and stood thinking. \"That won't help,\" he said curtly. \"Never in the world.\" With the aid of a convert, he unbarred the ponderous gate, and ventured out on the highest slab of the landing-steps. Across the river, to be sure, there lay--between a local junk and a stray _papico_ from the north--the high-nosed Hakka boat, her deck roofed with tawny basket-work, and at her masthead a wooden rice-measure dangling below a green rag. Aft, by the great steering-paddle, perched a man, motionless, yet seeming to watch. Heywood turned, however, and pointed downstream to where, at the bend of the river, a little spit of mud ran out from the marsh. On the spit, from among tussocks, a man in a round hat sprang up like a thin black toadstool. He waved an arm, and gave a shrill cry, summoning help from further inland. Other hats presently came bobbing toward him, low down among the marsh. Puffs of white spurted out from the mud. And as Heywood",

Wutzler pressed his face against the earth, and shivered in the stifling heat. The uncertainty grew, with Rudolph, into an acute distress. His legs ached and twitched, the bones of his neck were stretched as if to break, and a corner of broken clay bored sharply between his ribs. He felt no fear, however: only a great impatience to have the spy begin,--rise, beckon, call to his fellows, fire his gun, hit or miss. This longing, or a flash of anger, or the rice-brandy working so nimbly in his wits, gave him both impulse and plan. \"Don't move,\" he whispered; \"wait here.\" And wriggling backward, inch by inch, feet foremost among the crowded bellies of the jars, he gained the further darkness. So far as sight would carry, the head stirred no more than if it had been a cannon-ball planted there on the verge, against the rosy cloud. From crawling, Rudolph rose to hands and knees, and silently in the dust began to creep on a long circuit. Once, through a rift in smoke, he saw a band of yellow musketeers, who crouched behind some",

He remained therein eight minutes, walked about in all directions, and stopped in the coolest part, which was at 240 deg. Fahr. During all this time he experienced no painful sensations; but, at the end of seven minutes, he felt an oppression of the lungs that inquieted him and caused him to leave the place. His pulse at that moment showed 144 beats to the minute, that is to say, double what it usually did. To ascertain whether there was any error in the indications of the thermometer, and to find out what effect would take place on inert substances exposed to the hot air that he had breathed, Blogden placed some eggs in a zinc plate in the hot-house, alongside the thermometer, and found that in twenty minutes they were baked hard. A case is reported where workmen entered a furnace for drying moulds, in England, the temperature of which was 177 deg., and whose iron sole plate was so hot that it carbonized their wooden shoes. In the immediate vicinity of this furnace the temperature rose to 160 deg. Persons not of the trade who approached anywhere near the furnace experienced pain in the eyes, nose, and ears. A baker is cited in Angoumois, France, who spent ten minutes in a furnace at 132 deg. C. The",

He choked, swallowed, and presently heard the empty bottle splash in the river. \"_Stoesst an_!\" said the rescuer, and chuckled something in dispraise of women. \"Is that not better?\" The rice-brandy was hot and potent; for of a sudden Rudolph found himself afoot and awake. A dizzy warmth cleared his spirit. He understood perfectly. This man, for some strange reason, was Wutzler, a coolie and yet a brother from the fatherland. He and his nauseous alien brandy had restored the future. There was more to do. \"Come on.\" The forsaken lover was first man up the bank. \"See!\" he cried, pointing to a new flare in the distance. The whole region was now aglow like a furnace, and filled with smoke, with prolonged yells, and a continuity of explosions that ripped the night air like tearing silk. \"Her house is burning now.\" \"You left in time.\" Wutzler shuffled before him, with the trot of a lean and exhausted laborer. \"I was with the men you fought, when you ran. I followed to the house, and then here, to the river. I was glad you did not jump on board.\" He glanced back, timidly, for approbation. \"I am a great coward, Herr Heywood told me so,--but I also stay and help.\" He steered",

In the small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he bumped Heywood's elbow. \"Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say.\" The speaker patted the ground with quick palms, groping. \"Phew! They've worked like steam. This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow. I say, Rudie, feel about. I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it was. Ah, never mind: have-got!\" He pulled something along the floor. \"How's the old forearm I gave you? I forgot that. Equal to hauling a sack out? Good! Catch hold, here.\" Sweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph's, and guided it to where a powder-bag lay. \"Now, then, carry on,\" he commanded; and crawling into the tunnel, flung back fragments of explanation as he tugged at his own load. \"Carry these out--far as we dare--touch 'em off, you see, and block the passage.
