  "llm_answer": "The legal, familial, and romantic storylines are intertwined through the engagement of Roxie Daymon to Simon, Simon's obtaining a promise from Rose Simon, and Governor Morock's offer to arrange testimony for Roxie Daymon as follows:\n\n1. **Legal storyline**: Roxie Daymon's engagement to Simon and her potential inheritance of his estate are tied to the legal battle over the will. Governor Morock offers to arrange testimony for Roxie, implying that he can influence the outcome of the case in her favor. This suggests that Roxie's inheritance is not guaranteed and that the legal process will be complex.\n\n2. **Familial storyline**: Roxie's family history is revealed through her conversation with Simon on the boat. She mentions that her mother had two sisters, Rose and Suza, whom she has never met. This suggests that Roxie may have unknown relatives who could potentially claim a share of the estate. Simon's interest in Roxie's family history implies that he is aware of the potential complications and is trying to uncover more information.\n\n3. **Romantic storyline**: Roxie and Simon's engagement is a central plot point in the story. However, their relationship is also tied to the legal and familial storylines. Simon's interest in Roxie's family history and his decision to engage her despite the potential complications suggest that he is motivated by a desire to secure his estate for her. Roxie's honesty about her family history and her lack of connections also implies that she is aware of the potential risks and is willing to take a chance on Simon.\n\nIn summary, the engagement of Roxie Daymon to Simon, Simon's obtaining a promise from Rose Simon, and Governor Morock's offer to arrange testimony for Roxie Daymon are all intertwined through the complex web of legal, familial, and romantic storylines.",

Leave that to me, if you please,” and in a softer tone of voice the Governor continued, “you ought to pick up the _crumbs_, madam, pick up the crumbs.” “I would like to do so for I have never spent a cent in the prospect of the estate, though my credit is good for thousands in this city.. I want to see how a dead man's shoes will fit before I wear them,” said Roxie, sadly. “Good philosophy, madam, good philosophy,” said the Governor, and continued to explain. “There is cotton on the bank of the river at the Simon plantations. Some arrangement ought to be made, and I think I could do",

Cousin Cæsar had been absent but a short time, when that limb of the law appeared and wrote a will dictated by young Simon; bequeathing all of his possessions, without reserve to Roxie Daymon. “How much,” said Roxie, as the Governor was about to leave. “Only ten dollars, madam,” said the Governor, as he stuffed the bill carelessly in his vest pocket and departed. Through the long vigils of the night cousin Cæsar sat by the side of the dying man; before the sun had silvered the eastern horizon, the soul of young Simon was with his fathers. The day was consumed in making preparations for the last, honor due the dead. Cousin Cæsar arranged with a party to take the remains to Arkansas, and place the son by the side of the father, on the home plantation. The next morning as cousin Cæsar was scanning the morning papers, the following brief notice attracted his attention: “Young Simon, the wealthy young cotton planter, who died in the city yesterday, left by his last will and testament his whole estate, worth more than a million of dollars, to Roxie Daymon, a young lady of this city.” Cousin Cæsar was bewildered and astonished. He was a stranger in the",

During the first year of the war it was emphatically announced by the government at Washington, that it would never interfere with the slaves of loyal men. Roxie Daymon was loyal and lived in a loyal city. It was war times, and Roxie had received no dividends from the Simon estate. In the month of January, 1862, the cold north wind from the lakes swept the dust from the streets in Chicago, and seemed to warn the secret, silent thoughts of humanity of the great necessity of m-o-n-e-y. The good Angel of observation saw Roxie Daymon, with a richly-trimmed fur cloak upon her shoulders and hands muffed, walking swiftly on Strait street, in Chicago, watching the numbers--at No. 77 she disappeared. The good Angel opened his ear and has furnished us with the following conversation; “I have heard incidentally that Cæsar Simon is preparing to break the will of my _esteemed_ friend, Young Simon, of Arkansas,” said Roxie, sadly. “Is it p-o-s s-i-b-l-e?” said Governor Morock, affecting astonishment, and then continued, “More work for the lawyers, you know I am always liberal, madam.” “But do you think it possible?” said",

In the dusk of the evening, Young Simon and Roxie Daymon were sitting side by side--alone, on the aft-guard of the boat. The ever open ear of the Angel of observation has furnished us with the following conversation.. “Your mother's maiden name, is what I am anxious to learn,” said Simon gravely. “Roxie Fairfield, an orphan girl, raised in Kentucky,” said Roxie sadly. “Was she an only child, or did she have sisters?” said Simon inquiringly. “My mother died long years ago--when I was too young to remember, my father had no relations--that I ever heard of--Old aunt Patsey Perkins--a great friend of mother's in her life-time, told me after mother was dead, and I had grown large enough to think about kinsfolk, that mother had two sisters somewhere, named Rose and Suza, _poor trash_, as she called them; and that is all I know of my relations: and to be frank",

Cousin Cæsar now told young Simon the whole story. Twenty-thousand dollars, with twenty years interest, was against his estate. Roxie Daymon, the young lady on the boat, was an heir, others lived in Kentucky--all of which cousin Cæsar learned from a descendant of Brindle Bill.
