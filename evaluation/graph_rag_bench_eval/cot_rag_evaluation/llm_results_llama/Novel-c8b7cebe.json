Yet he hesitated a moment as he added, \"I would like to see Miss Flora.\" His hesitation and heightened color were more disarming to suspicion than the most elaborate and carefully prepared indifference. With their knowledge and pride in their relative's fascinations they felt it could have but one meaning! Hiram wiped his mouth with his hand, assumed a demure expression, glanced at his wife, and answered:-- \"She ain't here now.\" Mr. Brice's face displayed his disappointment. But the true lover holds a talisman potent with old and young. Mrs. Tarbox felt a sneaking maternal pity for this suddenly stricken Strephon. \"She's gone home,\" she added more gently--\"went at sun-up this mornin'.\" \"Home,\" repeated Brice. \"Where's that?\" Mrs. Tarbox looked at her husband and hesitated. Then she said--a little in her old manner--\"Her uncle's.\" \"Can you direct me the way there?\" asked Brice simply. The astonishment in their faces presently darkened into suspicion again. \"Ef that's your little game,\" began Hiram, with a lowering brow-- \"I have no little game but to see her and speak with her,\" said Brice boldly. \"I am alone and unarmed, as you see,\" he continued, pointing to his empty belt and small",

Then there was more talk, and the discovery that Mr. Brice was long due at the office. \"Ye might drop in, now and then, whenever ye feel like it, and Flo is at home,\" suggested Mrs. Tarbox at parting. Mr. Brice DID drop in frequently during the next month. On one of these occasions Mr. Tarbox accompanied him to the door. \"And now--ez everything is settled and in order, Mr. Brice, and ef you should be wantin' to say anything about it to your bosses at the office, ye may mention MY name ez Flo Dimwood's second cousin, and say I'm a depositor in their bank.

The old woman thought it a good chance to come to 'Frisco and put Flo in one o' them Catholic convent schools--that asks no questions whar the raw logs come from, and turns 'em out first-class plank all round. You foller me, Mr. Brice? But Mrs. Tarbox is jest in the next room, and would admire to tell ye all this--and I'll go in and send her to you.\" And with a patronizing wave of the hand, Mr. Tarbox complacently disappeared in the hall. Mr. Brice was not sorry to be left to himself in his utter bewilderment! Flo, separated from her detrimental uncle, and placed in a convent school! Tarbox, the obscure pioneer, a shrewd speculator emerging into success, and taking the uncle's place! And all this within that month which he had wasted with absurd repinings. How feeble seemed his own adventure and advancement; how even ludicrous his pretensions to any patronage and superiority. How this common backwoodsman had set him in his place as easily as SHE had evaded the advances of the journalist and Heckshill! They had taught him a lesson; perhaps even the sending back of his handkerchief was part of it! His heart grew heavy; he walked to the window and gazed out with a long sigh. A light laugh, that might have been an echo",

The old man appeared from some back door with a promptness that proved his near proximity, and glanced angrily at Brice until he caught sight of his wife's face. Then his anger changed to wonder. \"Read that again, young feller,\" she said exultingly. Brice re-read the paragraph aloud for Mr. Tarbox's benefit. \"That 'ar 'Hiram Tarbox, Esquire,' means YOU, Hiram,\" she gasped, in delighted explanation. Hiram seized the paper, read the paragraph himself, spread out the whole page, examined it carefully, and then a fatuous grin began slowly to extend itself over his whole face, invading his eyes and ears, until the heavy, harsh, dogged lines of his nostrils and jaws had utterly disappeared. \"B'gosh!\" he said, \"that's square! Kin I keep it?\" \"Certainly,\" said Brice. \"I brought it for you.\" \"Is that all ye came for?\" said Hiram, with sudden suspicion. \"No,\" said the young man frankly.
