  "gold_answer": "Derem is the native name for Mount Atlas, and Dyris is the ancient name for Mount Atlas.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, some historical and native names by which Mount Atlas has been known include:\n\n1. 'Derem' - the name amongst the modern aborigines.\n2. 'Dyris' - the name given by the ancient aborigines.\n3. 'Ras dirum' - a compound of 'Ras', head, and 'dirum', mountain, or the head of the mountain, given by the Moors to Cape Bon.\n4. 'Doa-el-Hamman', 'Tibet Deera', etc. - the names of separate chains of the mighty Atlas.\n\nThese names are mentioned in the context of the novel's discussion of Mount Atlas, and are compared to the Hebrew language, with 'Derem' signifying the place or aspect of the sun at noon-day, and 'Dyris' being connected to the Hebrew meaning 'great' or 'mighty'.",

This word has been compared to the Hebrew, signifying the place or aspect of the sun at noon-day, as if Mount Atlas was the back of the world, or the cultivated parts of the globe, and over which the sun was seen at full noon, in all his fierce and glorious splendour. Bochart connects the term with the Hebrew meaning 'great' or 'mighty,' which epithet would be naturally applied to the Atlas, and all mountains, by either a savage or civilized people. We have, also, on the northern coast, Russadirum, the name given by the Moors to Cape Bon, which is evidently a compound of _Ras_, head, and _dirum_, mountain, or the head of the mountain. We have again the root of this word in Doa-el-Hamman, Tibet Deera, &c., the names of separate chains of the mighty Atlas. Any way, the modern Der-en is seen to be the same with the ancient Dir-is.

In that part of the principal chain called Mount Gharian, in the south of Tripoli, several low branches branch off and under the names of Mounts Maray, Black Mount Haroudje, Mount Liberty, Mount Tiggerandoumma and others less known, furrow the great solitudes of the Desert of Lybia and Sahara Proper. From observations made on the spot by Mr. Bruguiere in the former state of Algiers, the great chain which several geographers traced beyond the Little Atlas under the name of Great Atlas does not exist. The inhabitants of Mediah who were questioned on the subject by this traveller, told him positively, that the way from that town to the Sahara was through a ground more or less elevated, and <DW72>s more or less steep, and without having any chain of mountains to cross. The Pass of Teniah which leads from Algiers to Mediah is, therefore, included in the principal chain of that part of the Regency.
