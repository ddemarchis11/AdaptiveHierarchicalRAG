  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the East River plays a significant role in Rags Raegen's actions and reputation, particularly in instances where he interacts with the river during police chases. \n\nRags Raegen is described as being at his best in the water, particularly in the East River. He has a history of diving into the river to escape from the police, leaving them staring in alarm. On one occasion, he even swam back underwater to the landing steps, while the policeman and a crowd of stevedores watched for him to reappear where he had sunk. This aquatic prowess has contributed to his reputation and has been a significant factor in his ability to evade capture.\n\nIn one instance, Rags even used his knowledge of the river to his advantage by directing the river-police's search for his \"corpse\" after he had dived into the water. He sat on the wharf and directed their movements, leading them to search the river-bed around Wakeman's Slip for four hours, while he remained hidden.\n\nThe East River has become an integral part of Rags' escape tactics and has contributed to his notoriety and reputation as a cunning and resourceful individual.",

Indeed, three different men in the precinct, who did not know of young Raegen's aquatic prowess, had returned to the station-house and seriously reported him to the sergeant as lost, and regretted having driven a citizen into the river, where he had been unfortunately drowned. It was even told how, on one occasion, when hotly followed, young Raegen had dived off Wakeman's Slip, at East Thirty-third Street, and had then swum back under water to the landing-steps, while the policeman and a crowd of stevedores stood watching for him to reappear where he had sunk. It is further related that he had then, in a spirit of recklessness, and in the possibility of the policeman's failing to recognize him, pushed his way through the crowd from the rear and plunged in to rescue the supposedly drowned man. And that after two or three futile attempts to find his own corpse, he had climbed up on the dock and told the officer that he had touched the body sticking in the mud. And, as a result of this fiction, the river-police dragged the river-bed around Wakeman's Slip with grappling irons for four hours, while Rags sat on the wharf and directed their movements. But on this present occasion the police were standing between him and the river, and so cut off his escape in that direction, and as they had seen him strike McGonegal",

The branch parted and the stem flew back to its place again, leaving a green sprig in her hand. She turned at that moment directly toward him, and he could see from his hiding-place how she lifted the leaves to her lips, and that a tear was creeping down her cheek. Then he dashed the bushes aside with both arms, and with a cry that no one but she heard sprang toward her. Young Van Bibber stopped his mail phaeton in front of the club, and went inside to recuperate, and told how he had seen them driving home through the Park in her brougham and unchaperoned. \"Which I call very bad form,\" said the punctilious Van Bibber, \"even though they are engaged.\" MY DISREPUTABLE FRIEND, MR.

And when it came to \"running the roofs,\" as he would have himself expressed it, he was \"not in it.\" On those other occasions when he had been followed by the police, he had raced them toward the river front and had dived boldly in from the wharf, leaving them staring blankly and in some alarm as to his safety.

The baby ran its arms more closely around Raegen's neck and did not speak, unless its cooing in Raegen's ear was an answer. \"What did you say your name was?\" persisted Raegen, in a whisper. The baby frowned at this and stopped cooing long enough to say: \"Marg'ret,\" mechanically and without apparently associating the name with herself or anything else. \"Margaret, eh!\" said Raegen, with grave consideration. \"It's a very pretty name,\" he added, politely, for he could not shake off the feeling that he was in the presence of a superior being. \"An' what did you say your dad's name was?\" asked Raegen, awkwardly. But this was beyond the baby's patience or knowledge, and she waived the question aside with both arms and began to beat a tattoo gently with her two closed fists on Raegen's chin and throat. \"You're mighty strong now, ain't you?\" mocked the young giant, laughing. \"Perhaps you don't know, Missie,\" he added, gravely, \"that your dad and mar are doing time on the Island, and you won't see 'em again for a month.\" No, the baby did not know this nor care apparently; she seemed content with Rags and with",

The sun rose hissing out of the East River, a broad, red disc of heat. It swept the cross-streets of the city as pitilessly as the search-light of a man-of-war sweeps the ocean. It blazed brazenly into open windows, and changed beds into gridirons on which the sleepers tossed and turned and woke unrefreshed and with throats dry and parched. Its glare awakened Rags into a startled belief that the place about him was on fire, and he stared wildly until the child in his arms brought him back to the knowledge of where he was. He ached in every joint and limb, and his eyes smarted with the dry heat, but the baby concerned him most, for she was breathing with hard, long, irregular gasps, her mouth was open and her absurdly small fists were clenched, and around her closed eyes were deep blue rings. Rags felt a cold rush of fear and uncertainty come over him as he stared about him helplessly for aid. He had seen babies look like this before, in the tenements; they were like this when the young doctors of the Health Board climbed to the roofs to see them, and they were like this, only quiet and still, when the ambulance came clattering up the narrow streets, and bore them away.",

We have here the remains of a large city, with the area of a temple, and some other fragments of large buildings. According to the tradition of the Arabs, this place received its name in consequence of a miracle pretended to have been wrought by one of their marabouts, in bringing hither the river of Spaitla, after it was lost underground. For Ja Elma signifies, in their language, 'The water comes!' an expression we are to imagine of surprise at the arrival of the stream.\" During our tour, the mornings were generally cold. We proceeded about twenty miles, and encamped near a place called Wady Tuckah. This river comes from the hills about three or four miles off, and when the camp arrives at Kairwan, the Bey sends an order to the Arabs of the district to let the water run down to the place where the tents are pitched. When we arrived, the water had just come. We saw warrens of hares, and caught many with the dogs. Troops of gazelles were also surprised; one was fired at, and went off scampering on three legs. The hawks caught a beautiful bird called hobara, or habary, [34] about the size of the small hen-turkey, lily white",
