Coom on! THE DEAN. May I say a few parting words in the home I have apparently wrecked? NOAH. Say' em and 'a done. THE DEAN. In setting out upon a journey, the termination of which is problematical, I desire to attest that this erring constable is the husband of a wife from whom it is impossible to withhold respect, if not admiration. NOAH. You 'ear' im! THE DEAN. As for my wretched self, the confession of my weaknesses must be reserved for another time--another place. [_To GEORGIANA._] To you, whose privilege it is to shelter in the sanctity of the Deanery, I give this earnest admonition.

A little way down the path stood Teppich and Chantel, each with his back turned and his hands clasped, like a pair of sulky Napoleons, one fat, one slender. The wooden pretense of their attitude set Rudolph, for an instant, to laughing silently and bitterly. This final scene,--what justice, that it should be a mean waste, the wreck of silly pleasure-grounds, long forgotten, and now used only by grotesque play-actors. He must die, in both action and setting, without dignity. It was some comfort, he became aware, to find that the place was fairly private. Except for the breach by which they had entered, the blotched and spotted compound walls stood ruinous yet high, shutting out all but a rising slant of sunlight, and from some outpost line of shops, near by, the rattle of an abacus and the broken singsong of argument, now harsh, now drowsy. Heywood had been speaking earnestly to Sturgeon:-- \"A little practice--try the balance of the swords. No more than fair.\" \"Fair? Most certainly,\" croaked that battered convivialist. \"Chantel can't object.\" He rose, and waddled down the path. Rudolph saw Chantel turn, frowning, then nod and smile. The nod was courteous, the smile full",

It's an easy climb--if you mind the path--just where it passes the spring.\" [Illustration: BOSCASTLE.] That spring, trickling down from the very top of the rock, and making a verdant space all round it--what a treasure it must have been to the unknown inhabitants who, centuries ago, entrenched themselves here--for offence or defence--against the main-land. Peacefully it flowed on still, with the little ferns growing, and the sheep nibbling beside it. We idle tourists alone occupied that solitary height where those long-past warlike races--one succeeding the other--lived and loved, fought and died. The chapel--where the high altar and a little burial-ground beside it can still be traced--is clearly much later than Arthur's time. However, there are so few data to go upon, and the action of sea-storms destroys so much every year, that even to the learned archaeologist, Tintagel is a great mystery, out of which the imaginative mind may evolve almost anything it likes. We sat a long time on the top of the rock--realising only the one obvious fact that our eyes were gazing on precisely the same scene, seawards and coastwards, that all these long-dead eyes were accustomed to behold.
