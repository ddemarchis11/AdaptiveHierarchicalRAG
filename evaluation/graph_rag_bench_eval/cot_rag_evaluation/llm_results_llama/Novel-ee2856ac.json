  "gold_answer": "Alcohol poisons the mind and prevents the brain from thinking well by affecting the nerves through which the brain sends messages.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, the consumption of alcohol impacts the brain's ability to function in the following ways:\n\n1. It deadens the nerves, so that they cannot carry their messages correctly.\n2. It prevents the brain from thinking well.\n3. It interferes with the nerves that carry the brain's messages, causing them to become tired and unable to work properly.\n4. It injures the brain and nerves, making it difficult for them to work well and send their messages properly.\n5. It causes the brain to become worn out, making it difficult to repair.\n6. It makes the head ache and hurts the brain and nerves.\n7. It slowly poisons the body, making it less able to bear sickness and less likely to get well again.\n8. It causes people to become careless and not do their work faithfully.\n9. It makes it difficult for people to know what they are doing, as the brain receives no message or the wrong one.\n\nOverall, the consumption of alcohol is portrayed as a poison that can harm the brain and nerves, leading to a range of negative consequences.",

      "text": "for going without the rum.\" STRENGTH OF MIND. We have been talking about the strength of muscles; but the very best kind of strength we have is brain strength, or strength of mind. Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can not carry their messages correctly. Then the brain can not think well. Alcohol does not strengthen the mind. Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make him useful and happy. Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole. Would you be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a palace, and had a million of dollars? If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not let alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. What things were left out of our bill of fare?           2. How could you measure your strength?           3. How can you gain strength?           4. Why does drinking beer not make",

      "text": "one part of the brain has to take care of all the rest of the body, and keep every organ at work, of course it can never go to sleep itself. If it did, the heart would stop pumping, the lungs would leave off breathing, all other work would stop, and the body would be dead. But there is another part of the brain which does the thinking, and this part needs rest. When you are asleep, you are not thinking, but you are breathing and other work of the body is going on. If the thinking part of the brain does not have good quiet sleep, it will soon wear out. A worn-out brain is not easy to repair. If well cared for, your brain will do the best of work for you for seventy or eighty years without complaining. The nerves are easily tired out, and they need much rest. They get tired if we do one thing too long at a time; they are rested by a change of work. IS ALCOHOL GOOD FOR THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN? Think of the wonderful work the brain is all the time doing for you! You ought to give it the best of food to keep it in good working order. Any drink that contains alcohol is not a food to make one strong; but is a poison to hurt, and at last to kill. It injures the brain and nerves so that they can not work well, and send their messages properly. That is why the drunkard does not",

Newspapers often tell us about people setting houses on fire; about men who forgot to turn the switch, and so wrecked a railroad train; about men who lay down on the railroad track and were run over by the cars. Often these stories end with: \"The person had been drinking.\" When the nerves are put to sleep by alcohol, people become careless and do not do their work faithfully; sometimes, they can not even tell the difference between a railroad track and a place of safety. The brain receives no message, or the wrong one, and the person does not know what he is doing. You may say that all men who drink liquor do not do such terrible things. That is true. A little alcohol is not so bad as a great deal. But even a little makes the head ache, and hurts the brain and nerves. A body kept pure and strong is of great service to its owner. There are people who are not drunkards, but who often drink a little liquor. By this means, they slowly poison their bodies. When sickness comes upon them, they are less able to bear it, and less likely to get well again, than those who have never injured their bodies with alcohol.
