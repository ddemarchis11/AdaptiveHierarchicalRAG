  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — My days with my mistress were filled with warmth and chatter. Today, I said farewell to Corinna, her eyes glistening with sorrow. I was snatched away by envy, separated from her gentle hands. I have heard it said that my mistress is born to be a cause of trouble to her lover, and perhaps, even my loss plays a part in the tangled affairs of the heart.",
  "llm_answer": "Dear Diary,\n\nI can barely remember the day I was taken from my mistress, Corinna. I was her prized possession, a parrot with a tongue more skilled at talking than any other bird. My plumage was a sight to behold, with feathers that shone like the green emerald and a beak tinted with the ruddy saffron. I could mimic the sounds of the world around me, and my lisping notes were music to Corinna's ears.\n\nBut I was more than just a pretty face and a clever voice. I was a companion, a friend, and a lover of peaceful concord. I brought joy to Corinna's life, and she to mine. We were inseparable, and I was the cause of no cruel wars. I was a chatterer, not a fighter.\n\nBut fate had other plans. I was snatched away from Corinna, taken by envy and greed. I was left to wander the world, alone and adrift. I saw the quails, with their battles and their strife, and I wondered why I was not like them. They lived on, despite their conflicts, and perhaps that was why they became old.\n\nI was a bird of simple tastes, content with a nut for food and a drop of pure water to quench my thirst. I was a bird of few needs, and yet I was taken from the one who loved me most. I was a parrot, a mimic of the human voice, sent as a gift from the ends of the earth. And now I am gone, taken by the cruel hand of fate.\n\nAs I lay on my deathbed, my tongue cried out one final time, \"Corinna, farewell!\" And in that moment, I knew that I was leaving behind a piece of my heart. I was a bird of love and peace, and I was taken from the one who needed me most.\n\nIn the end, it was not the heroes or the gods who could save me. It was not even Corinna's prayers, borne on the stormy North wind. My time had come, and I was taken from this world, leaving behind only memories of my time with Corinna.\n\nFarewell, dear diary. Farewell, dear Corinna. I will be remembered as a parrot with a tongue more skilled at talking than any other bird. And in the groves of the Elysian hill, I will be reunited with the innocent birds, where I will be free to speak my mind and bring joy to those who need it most.\n\nYours truly,\nThe Parrot",

All, who poise yourselves in your career in the liquid air; but you, above the rest, affectionate turtle-dove, [360] lament him. Throughout life there was a firm attachment between you, and your prolonged and lasting friendship endured to the end. What the Phocian youth [361] was to the Argive Orestes, the same, parrot, was the turtle-dove to you, so long as it was allowed _by fate._ But what _matters_ that friendship? What the beauty of your rare plumage? What your voice so ingenious at imitating sounds? What avails it that _ever_ since you were given, you pleased my mistress? Unfortunate pride of _all_ birds, you are indeed laid low. With your feathers you could outvie the green emerald, having your purple beak tinted with the ruddy saffron. There was no bird on earth more skilled at imitating sounds; so prettily [362] did you utter words with your lisping notes. Through envy, you were snatched away _from us_: you were the cause of no cruel wars; you were a chatterer, and the lover of peaceful concord.

And yet your words did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue cried aloud, \"Corinna, farewell!\" [370] At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green. If there is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole bird _of its kind. There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers; the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate. Received in this home in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his words. [372] A sepulchre covers his bones; a sepulchre small as his body; on which a little stone has _this_ inscription, well suited to itself: \"From this very tomb [377] I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress.
