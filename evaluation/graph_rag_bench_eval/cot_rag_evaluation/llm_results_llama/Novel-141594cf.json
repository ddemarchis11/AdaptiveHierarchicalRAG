  "llm_answer": "The narrative depicts the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery through Blore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver and the process by which Major Tarver is ultimately accepted by Salome as follows:\n\nBlore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver is portrayed as a somewhat awkward and informal introduction. When Blore shows in Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey, the ladies, Salome and Sheba, are caught off guard and start in confusion. This suggests that the established group at the Deanery is not accustomed to receiving unexpected visitors, and Blore's action is seen as a breach of etiquette.\n\nThe process by which Major Tarver is ultimately accepted by Salome is a gradual one. Initially, Salome is startled and disapproving of Major Tarver's presence, as evident from her reaction when he takes her hand eagerly and says \"My dear Miss Jedd!\" However, as the scene progresses, Salome's demeanor softens, and she begins to engage with Major Tarver in a more cordial manner. When Major Tarver asks about the costumes for the evening, Salome responds with a sense of familiarity and ease, suggesting that she is beginning to accept him as a member of the group.\n\nFurthermore, the narrative suggests that Major Tarver's acceptance by Salome is facilitated by his association with Mr. Darbey, who is a member of the established group. When Mr. Darbey and Major Tarver arrive at the Deanery, they are greeted warmly by the Dean, and Mr. Darbey is treated as an old friend. This suggests that Mr. Darbey's social status and connections within the group have helped to pave the way for Major Tarver's acceptance.\n\nOverall, the narrative portrays the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery as a complex and nuanced process, involving a combination of awkward introductions, gradual acceptance, and social connections.",
