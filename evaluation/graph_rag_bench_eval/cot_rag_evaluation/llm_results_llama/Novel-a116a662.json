      "text": "spot. Trust him!\" A calm \"boy,\" in sky-blue gown, stood beside them, ready to speak. The dispute paused, while they turned for his message. It was a disappointing trifle: Mrs. Forrester waited below for her husband, to walk home. \"Can't leave now,\" snapped Gilly. \"I'll be along, tell her--\" \"Had she better go alone?\" suggested Heywood. \"No; right you are.\" The other swept a fretful eye about the company. \"But this business begins to look urgent.--Here, somebody we can spare. You go, Hackh, there's a good chap.\" Chantel dropped the helmet he had caught up. Bowing stiffly, Rudolph marched across the room and down the stairs. His face, pale at the late spectacle, had grown red and sulky, \"Can spare me, can you?--I'm the one.\" He descended, muttering. Viewing himself thus, morosely, as rejected of men, he reached the compound gate to fare no better with the woman. She stood waiting in the shadow of the wall; and as he drew unwillingly near, the sight of her--to his shame and quick dismay--made his heart leap in welcome. She wore the coolest and severest white, but at her throat the same small furbelow, every line of which he had known aboard ship, in the days of his first exile and of his recent",

His quick blue eyes danced with the light of some ineffable joke. He seemed a conjurer, creating banquets for sheer mischief in the wilderness. \"There's a soup!\" he had proclaimed. \"Patent, mind ye! Stick a knife into the tin, and she 'eats 'erself!\" Among all the revelers, one face alone showed melancholy. Chantel, at the foot of the table, sat unregarded by all save Rudolph, who now and then caught from him a look filled with gloom and suspicion. It was beside Rudolph that Mrs. Forrester laughed and chattered, calling all eyes toward her, and yet finding private intervals in which to dart a sidelong shaft at her neighbor. Rudolph's ears shone coral pink; for now again he was aboard ship, hiding a secret at once dizzy, dangerous, and entrancing. Across the talk, the wine, the many lights, came the triumph of seeing that other hostile face, glowering in defeat. Never before had Chantel, and all the others, dwindled so far into such nonentity, or her presence vibrated so near. Soon he became aware that Captain Kneebone had risen, with a face glowing red above the candles. Even Sturgeon forgot the flood",

He started, turned for some rush of overwhelming speech, when a head popped through the window behind them. \"Boot and saddle, Mrs. Forrester,\" announced Heywood. His lean young face was very droll and knowing. \"We're leaving, bottom-side.\" \"Thank you so much, Maurice,\" she answered, perhaps dryly. \"You're a dear, to climb all those dreadful stairs.\" \"Oh!\" said Heywood, with his gray eyes fastened on Rudolph, \"no trouble.\" All three went down the dark well together. When the company were mounted, and trooping downhill through the camphor shadow, Heywood's pony came sidling against Rudolph's, till legging chafed legging. \"You blossomed, old boy,\" he whispered. \"Quite the star, after your comedy turn.\" He reined aside, grinning. \"What price sympathy on a pagoda?\" For that moment, Rudolph could have struck down the one sure friend he had in China. CHAPTER VII IPHIGENIA \"Don't chop off a hen's head with a battle-axe.\" Heywood, still with a malicious, friendly quirk at the corners of his mouth, held in his fretful pony. Rudolph stood bending a whip viciously. They two had fetched a compass about the town, and now in the twilight were parting before",

All his life seemed to have rushed concentrating into that one instant of extreme trouble, happiness, trembling fascination. Footsteps sounded on the deck behind them; an unwelcome voice called jocosely:-- \"Good efening!\" The ship's doctor advanced with a roguish, paternal air. \"You see at the phosphor, not?\" Even as she whipped about toward the light, Rudolph had seen, with a touch of wonder, how her face changed from a bitter frown to the most friendly smile. The frown returned, became almost savage, when the fat physician continued:-- \"To see the phosphor is too much moon, Mrs. Forrester?\" Had the steamer crashed upon a reef, he would hardly have noticed such a minor shipwreck. Mrs. Forrester? why, then--When the doctor, after ponderous pleasantries, had waddled away aft, Rudolph turned upon her a face of tragedy. \"Was that true?\" he demanded grimly. \"Was what true?\" she asked, with baby eyes of wonder, which no longer deceived, but angered. \"What the doctor said.\" Rudolph's voice trembled. \"The tittle--the title he gave you.\" \"Why, of course,\" she laughed.",

It was now as though that youth came flooding back to greet her. \"Good-morning.\" He forgot everything, except that for a few priceless moments they would be walking side by side. She faced him with a start, never so young and beautiful as now--her blue eyes wide, scornful, and blazing, her cheeks red and lips trembling, like a child ready to cry. \"I did not want _you_\" she said curtly. \"Nor did they.\" Pride forged the retort for him, at a blow. He explained in the barest of terms, while she eyed him steadily, with every sign of rising temper. \"I can spare you, too,\" she whipped out; then turned to walk away, holding her helmet erect, in the poise of a young goddess, pert but warlike. This double injustice left Rudolph chafing. In two strides, however, he had overtaken her. \"I am under orders,\" he stated grimly. Her pace gradually slackened in the growing heat; but she went forward with her eyes fixed on the littered, sunken flags of their path. This rankling silence seemed to him more unaccountable and deadly than all former mischances, and left him far more alone. From the sultry tops of bamboos,",

FAWCETT,--I wrote to you from the office this morning, but I want to point out a little more fully what the Committee felt about the name of the hospitals. We felt that our original scheme was growing very quickly into something very big--much bigger than anything we had thought of at the beginning--and we felt that if the hospitals were called by a non-committal name it would be much easier to get all men and women to help. The scheme is _of course_ a National Union scheme, and that fact the Scottish Federation will never lose sight of, or attempt to disguise. The National Union will be at the head of all our appeals, and press notices, and paper. ‘But--if you could reverse the position, and imagine for a moment that the Anti-Suffrage Society had thought of organising all these skilled women for service, you can quite see that many more neutrals, and a great many suffragists would have been ready to help if they sent their subscriptions to the “Scottish Women’s Hospital for Foreign Service,” than if they had to send to the Anti-Suffrage League Hospital. ‘We were convinced that",
