It will make you feel exactly as if you were dead and buried.\" That not being the prominent object of our tour in Cornwall, we thanked him again, but as soon as he left the carriage determined among ourselves to take no further steps about visiting Gerrans. [Illustration: VIEW OF FLUSHING FROM THE GREEN BANK HOTEL, FALMOUTH.] However, in spite of the urgency of another fellow-traveller--it is always good to hear everybody's advice, and follow your own--we carried our love of quietness so far that we eschewed the magnificent new Falmouth Hotel, with its _table d'hote_, lawn tennis ground, sea baths and promenade, for the old-fashioned Green Bank, which though it had no green banks, boasted, we had been told, a pleasant little sea view and bay view, and was a resting-place full of comfort and homely peace. Which we found true, and would have liked to stay longer in its pleasant shelter, which almost conquered our horror of hotels; but we had now fairly weighed anchor and must sail on. \"You ought to go at once to the Lizard,\" said the friend who met us, and did everything for us at Falmouth--and the remembrance of whom, and of all that happened in our brief stay, will make the very name of the place sound sweet in our ears",

The building had just been finished and furnished for occupancy. A strong wind was raging and the little band of firemen were unable to save the structure. The names of Rev. D.D. Neill, Isaac Markley, Bartlett Presley and W.M. Stees were among the firemen who assisted in saving the furniture. The Sintominie hotel on the corner of Sixth and John streets, was the second hotel to receive a visit from the fire king. This hotel was constructed by the late C.W. Borup, and it was the pride of lower town. Howard Ward and E.C. Rich were preparing to open it when the fire occurred. Owing to the lack of fire protection the building was totally destroyed. Early in the winter of 1856 the Rice house, commonly supposed to be the first brick building erected in St. Paul, was burned to the ground. It was three stories high, and when in process of building was considered a visionary enterprise. The building was constructed by Henry M. Rice, and he spared no expense to make it as complete as the times would allow. It was situated on Third street near Market, and in the early days was considered St. Paul's principal hotel. In its parlor and barroom the second session of the territorial legislature was held, and the supreme court of the",

The green-wooded valleys, the rounded hills, on one of which we were shown the remains of the old castle of Ristormel, noted among the three castles of Cornwall; all this, familiar to so many, was to us absolutely new, and we enjoyed it and the kindly interest that was taken in pointing it out to us, as happy-minded simple folk do always enjoy the sight of a new country. [Illustration: ST. MAWE'S CASTLE, FALMOUTH BAY.] Our pleasure seemed to amuse an old gentleman who sat in the corner. He at last addressed us, with an unctuous west-country accent which suited well his comfortable stoutness. He might have fed all his life upon Dorset butter and Devonshire cream, to one of which counties he certainly belonged. Not, I think, to the one we were now passing through, and admiring so heartily. \"So you're going to travel in Cornwall. Well, take care, they're sharp folk, the Cornish folk.
