  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today was a day of sorrow. My beloved parrot, companion and confidant, was snatched away by envious fate, taken from my side. I said my farewells with heavy heart. In my grief, I called upon Isis, hoping she would turn her features to me and grant comfort. The gods are distant, yet my pain feels as if I am born to be a cause of trouble to my lover.",
  "llm_answer": "February 10th, \n\nToday was the day I had to say goodbye to my beloved parrot. I'm still trying to process the emotions that are swirling inside me. As I sat in the grove at the foot of the Elysian hill, surrounded by the dark holm oaks and the never-dying grass, I couldn't help but think of the memories we shared. The parrot, who had been my constant companion, had been a gift from the gods, and I had grown to love it as if it were my own child.\n\nAs I looked at the sepulchre that covered its bones, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness. The inscription on the stone read: \"From this very tomb I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress. I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.\" It was a fitting tribute to my dear parrot, who had brought so much joy and laughter into my life.\n\nI remembered the times we spent together, the way it would mimic my words and the way it would attract the other birds with its charming voice. I recalled the story of Isis, who was invoked in the triplets, and how she was said to have the power to bring life and fertility to those who worshipped her. I had often invoked her name in my prayers, asking for her protection and guidance.\n\nAs I sat there, surrounded by the beauty of nature, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that my parrot was in a better place, surrounded by the innocent birds and the gentle creatures of the Elysian hill. I took comfort in the knowledge that it was no longer suffering, and that it was at peace.\n\nFarewell, my dear parrot. May you rest in peace, and may your memory live on in my heart forever.",

And yet your words did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue cried aloud, \"Corinna, farewell!\" [370] At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green. If there is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole bird _of its kind. There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers; the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate. Received in this home in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his words. [372] A sepulchre covers his bones; a sepulchre small as his body; on which a little stone has _this_ inscription, well suited to itself: \"From this very tomb [377] I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress. I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.\" ELEGY VII. _He attempts to convince his mistress,",

THE apples and nuts went round again and again, and for a few minutes nothing was heard save the cracking of shells and the gnawing of sharp white teeth. At length the parrot said, meditatively:-- \"That was a very stupid cow, though! Are all cows as stupid as that?\" \"Well, I don't think they are what you would call brilliant, as a rule,\" Toto admitted; \"but they are generally good, and that is better.\" \"Hem! possibly!\" said Miss Mary, dryly. \"That is probably why we have no cows in Central Africa. Our animals being all, without exception, clever _and_ good, there is really no place for creatures of the sort you describe.\" \"How about the bogghun, Miss Mary?\" asked the raccoon, slyly, with a wink at Toto.
