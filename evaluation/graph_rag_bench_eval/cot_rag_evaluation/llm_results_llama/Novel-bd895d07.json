  "llm_answer": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, the body processes food for use in growth and energy as follows:\n\n1. The stomach prepares the food by mixing it with gastric juice, turning it into a gray fluid.\n2. The stomach then sends the prepared food into the intestines, a long, coiled tube.\n3. The prepared food is taken into the blood from the intestines.\n4. The blood carries the food to the heart.\n5. The heart pumps the blood out with the prepared food into the lungs.\n6. The lungs use fresh air to make the dark, impure blood bright and pure again.\n7. The blood then carries the food to every part of the body, leaving with each part just what it needs.\n\nThe blood transports the prepared food to all parts of the body through arteries, which are tubes that lead by thousands of little branches all through the body. The blood is pumped through these arteries by the heart, and it returns to the heart through veins.",

The windpipe will not pass it to the lungs, but tries to force it back. Then we say the food chokes us. If the windpipe can not succeed in forcing back the food, the person will die. HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY. But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down into the stomach. There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric juice, until it is all a gray fluid. Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which leads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into the blood. The blood carries it to the heart. The heart pumps it out with the blood into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle, and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain. Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner can help to mend any parts that may be broken. Suppose a boy should break one of the bones of his arm, how could it be mended? If you should bind together the two parts of a broken stick and leave them a while, do you think they would grow together? No, indeed! But the doctor could carefully bind together the ends of the broken bone in the boy's arm and leave",

As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the body. These tubes are called arteries (aer't[)e]r iz). Those tubes which bring the blood back again to the heart, are called veins (v[=a]nz). You can see some of the smaller veins in your wrist. If you press your finger upon an artery in your wrist, you can feel the steady beating of the pulse. This tells just how fast the heart is pumping and the blood flowing. The doctor feels your pulse when you are sick, to find out whether the heart is working too fast, or too slowly, or just right. Some way is needed to send the gray fluid that is made from the food we eat and drink, to every part of the body. To send the food with the blood is a sure way of making it reach every part. So, when the stomach has prepared the food, the blood takes it up and carries it to every part of the body. It then leaves with each part, just what it needs. THE BLOOD AND THE BRAIN. As the brain has so much work to attend",

Be sure to give them time enough for this. WORK OF THE BODY. You have now learned about four important kinds of work:-- 1st. The stomach prepares the food for the blood to take. 2d. The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of the body, and to take away worn-out matter. 3d. The lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and pure again. 4th. The skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration tubes. All this work goes on, day and night, without our needing to think about it at all; for messages are sent to the muscles by the nerves which keep them faithfully at work, whether we know it or not.
