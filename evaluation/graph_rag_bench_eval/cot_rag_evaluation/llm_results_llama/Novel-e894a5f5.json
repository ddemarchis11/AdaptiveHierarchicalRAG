  "gold_answer": "The Devil's Frying-pan is near Cadgwith.",
  "llm_answer": "The Devil's Frying-pan is geographically related to the village of Cadgwith in that it is located near the village. \n\nSpecifically, it is described as being near Cadgwith in the following passages:\n\n- \"The principal thing to be seen at Cadgwith. The Devil's Frying-pan, near Cadgwith.\" (Novel-44557_c_51)\n- \"Illustration: THE DEVIL'S FRYING PAN, NEAR CADGWITH.\" (Novel-44557_c_52)\n- \"The Devil's Frying-pan looked, within and without, much as it must have looked for the last hundred years; and the ragged, unkempt, tongue-tied little girl, from whom we succeeded in getting a drink of milk in a tumbler which she took five minutes to search for, had certainly never been to a Board School. She investigated the penny which we deposited as if it were a great natural curiosity rarely attainable, and she gazed after us as we climbed the stile leading to the Frying-pan as if wondering what on earth could tempt respectable people, who had nothing to do, into such a very uncomfortable place.\" (Novel-44557_c_52)\n\nThis suggests that the Devil's Frying-pan is a nearby attraction or landmark that can be seen from Cadgwith.",

Were Cadgwith a little nearer civilisation, what a show-place it would become! But happily civilisation leaves it alone. The tiny farm-house on the hill-side near the Frying-pan looked, within and without, much as it must have looked for the last hundred years; and the ragged, unkempt, tongue-tied little girl, from whom we succeeded in getting a drink of milk in a tumbler which she took five minutes to search for, had certainly never been to a Board School.

In these parts everybody stares at everybody, and generally everybody speaks to everybody--a civil \"good-day\" at any rate, sometimes more. \"This is a heavy pull for you,\" said a sympathetic old woman, who had watched me leave the carriage and begin mounting the cliff towards the Devil's Frying-pan--the principal thing to be seen at Cadgwith. She followed me, and triumphantly passed me, though she had to carry a bag of potatoes on her back. I wondered if her feeling was pity or envy towards another old person who had to carry nothing but her own self. Which, alas! was enough! She and I sat down together on the hill-side and had a chat, while I waited for the two little black dots which I could see moving round the opposite headland. She gave me all kinds of information, in the simple way peculiar to country folk, whose innocent horizon comprises the whole world, which, may be, is less pleasant than the little world of Cadgwith. Then we parted for ever and aye. The Devil's Frying-pan is a wonderful sight. Imagine a natural amphitheatre two acres in extent, inclosed by a semi-circular <DW72> about two hundred feet high, covered with grass and flowers and low bushes.
