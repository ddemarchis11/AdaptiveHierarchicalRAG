  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Dr. Inglis as being involved in the stipulations made by the Foreign Office, which is supported by the context. However, it misses the specific mention of the Scottish Women's Hospitals, which is a key fact in the Gold Answer. While the answer is grounded in the context, it does not fully align with the Gold Answer's emphasis on the organization involved."
