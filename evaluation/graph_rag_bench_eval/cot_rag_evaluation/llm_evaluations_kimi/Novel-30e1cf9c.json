    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the retrieved context does not name any illustrator for the German edition of 'Tristram Shandy,' which is accurate based on the provided context. However, the Gold Answer specifies J. F. Schröter as the illustrator, and the Model Answer fails to include this information, making it incorrect in terms of answering the user's question. The retrieved context does not contradict the Model Answer, so it is faithful to the context, but it does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
