    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain relevant information about Ovid's writing or its connection to the theme of Love. However, it fails to address the question using internal knowledge or provide any answer related to the Gold Answer, which mentions Naso writing about Love inflamed in Ceres. Thus, the answer is incorrect and lacks evidence coverage."
