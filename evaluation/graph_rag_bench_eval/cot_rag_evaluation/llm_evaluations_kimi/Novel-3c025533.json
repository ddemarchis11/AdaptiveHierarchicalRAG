  "question": "In the context of surveying as discussed in the text, for what purpose is the determination of latitude needed?",
  "gold_answer": "Latitude is needed for determination of true meridian.",
  "llm_answer": "The determination of latitude is needed in order to find the azimuth of Polaris, which in turn is used to establish a true meridian for surveying.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 1.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that latitude is needed to establish a true meridian, which aligns with the Gold Answer. Additionally, it provides further context by explaining that latitude is used to find the azimuth of Polaris, which is supported by the retrieved context. All claims are grounded in the context, and the key fact from the Gold Answer is included."
