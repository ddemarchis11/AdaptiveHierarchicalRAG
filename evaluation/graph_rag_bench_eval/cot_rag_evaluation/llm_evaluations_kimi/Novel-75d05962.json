  "question": "Following the King's decision to appoint my Lord, how do my Lord's subsequent actions—such as taking leave of the King, visiting Whitehall, and preparing for a journey to Algier—reveal his active and multifaceted role within the narrative?",
  "gold_answer": "After being appointed by the King, my Lord is depicted as taking leave, visiting important places, and preparing for travel, revealing his active and multifaceted role.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows that, immediately after the King appoints him Ambassador for bringing over the Queen, my Lord:\n\n- Takes formal leave of the King at Whitehall, underlining that he is acting in an official, Crown-approved capacity.  \n- Visits Whitehall repeatedly, conferring with ministers and organising the cloth, money and goods he is to carry, so the narrative presents him as already running a complex diplomatic mission rather than merely receiving an honour.  \n- Prepares to sail first to Algier “to settle the business, and to put the fleet in order there,” then on to Lisbon to meet the incoming Queen’s fleet—actions that cast him as naval organiser, envoy and escort in one.  \n\nThese steps reveal an active, many-sided role: he is simultaneously courtier, ambassador, naval superintendent and logistics co-ordinator, driving the narrative forward from the moment the King entrusts him with the task.",
