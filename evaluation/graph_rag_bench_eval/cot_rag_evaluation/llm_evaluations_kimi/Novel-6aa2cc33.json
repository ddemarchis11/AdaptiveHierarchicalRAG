  "question": "How does the narrative chain connect Cornwall's legendary expression to Arthur and his associates, particularly through Arthur's relationship with Sir Bedevere and the pivotal event of Excalibur being thrown away?",
  "gold_answer": "Cornwall is said to find its legendary expression in Arthur, who is connected to Sir Bedivere and pivotal events like the throwing of Excalibur, tying the region's narrative identity to Arthurian legend.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative chain is forged in three explicit steps:\n\n1. Arthur’s mortal defeat at Camelford drives him to command his “last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere” to carry him to the shore of Dozmare Pool and there “throw in … his sword Excalibur.”  \n2. Bedevere’s obedience to this order—he “threw Excalibur into the mere”—is the pivotal act that immediately summons the mysterious boat bearing three queens who bear the wounded king away.  \n3. This single act of loyalty by Bedevere thus binds the Cornish locality (Dozmare Pool) to the legendary expression of Arthur’s departure, making the knight’s fidelity the indispensable link between the king and the immortal tradition that “he will reappear in latter days.”",
