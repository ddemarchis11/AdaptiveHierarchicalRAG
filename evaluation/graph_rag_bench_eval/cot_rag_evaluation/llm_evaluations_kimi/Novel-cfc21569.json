    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not specify where Raegen wishes to hide or why he considers those locations safe. The Gold Answer clearly states that Raegen wanted to hide in his own cellar and garret, which is not addressed in the Model Answer. Additionally, the Retrieved Context does not provide relevant information to support the Model Answer's claim, making it unfaithful and lacking evidence coverage."
