  "gold_answer": "Senator Plumb and Robert Ingersoll were interested in Ivanhoe.",
  "llm_answer": "The notable individuals interested in the Ivanhoe mine were Colonel Gillette (manager), Robert Ingersoll, and Senator Plumb of Kansas.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Robert Ingersoll and Senator Plumb as notable individuals interested in the Ivanhoe mine, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it adds Colonel Gillette as a notable individual, which is not supported by the context as he is mentioned as the manager, not someone 'interested' in the mine. This addition slightly detracts from correctness and evidence coverage but does not contradict the context."
