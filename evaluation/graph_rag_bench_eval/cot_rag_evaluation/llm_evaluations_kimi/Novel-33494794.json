  "gold_answer": "Rags felt responsibility and self-respect for Margaret and bathed the baby's face, hands, and feet.",
  "llm_answer": "Rags demonstrates responsibility and care for baby Margaret by:\n\n- Preparing and feeding her a mixture when he realizes she is hungry, watching for her eager acceptance as a sign she is better.  \n- Fanning her while she sleeps to keep her cool, experiencing “keen satisfaction” in doing even this small service.  \n- Refusing to leave the hiding place to seek milk once he suspects the police are looking for him, putting her safety above his own hunger.  \n- Blaming himself harshly after accidentally falling asleep and leaving her unattended in the heat; he immediately revives her with fanning and patting, then determines to risk going out for food because “it’s been near two days that child’s gone without.”",
