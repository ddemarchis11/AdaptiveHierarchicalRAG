  "question": "In 'Pen Pictures,' how is Cousin Cæsar's involvement both in military affairs and within his family relationships portrayed? Please include details about his close counsel with Cliff Carlo regarding legal matters, his service under General Price during the Civil War, and the circumstances in which he was ultimately left alone by Steve Brindle.",
  "gold_answer": "Cousin Cæsar was in close counsel with Cliff Carlo, served under Gen. Price, and was left alone by Steve Brindle.",
  "llm_answer": "Cousin Cæsar’s military and family life are shown through three linked episodes.\n\n1. Civil-War service under General Price  \n   – He is mustered as “No. 77” in Price’s northward move, fights at Lexington (12-20 Sept.), and later at the Independence-Day assault on the river forts.  \n   – During the failed attack he shelters under fire while Price’s division, alone among the three Confederate columns, carries its fort.  \n   – After the battle he slips away at night to find Steve Brindle, who has been reported mortally wounded and sent south with the sick.\n\n2. Close counsel with Cliff Carlo on the Simon-estate lawsuit  \n   – While spring blossoms open on the Ohio bank, Cousin Cæsar and Cliff Carlo confer over how to meet the legal expenses of the contest at law in Arkansas.  \n   – Cliff is “non-committal” because Roxie Daymon, a near relative, is involved; compromise is distasteful to Cæsar, who declares, “I have made the cast, and will stand the hazard of the die.”\n\n3. How Steve Brindle finally leaves him alone  \n   – Brindle once saved Cæsar’s life on the field, shared his last cent, and even “opened the door” to the fortune Cæsar now enjoys.  \n   – When Cæsar is surrounded by wealth and power, he is “willing to conceal his antecedents” and pretends not to know “S-t-e-v-e Brindle,” offering no help when honest employment might have redeemed the man.  \n   – Thus, after the night ride to ease his dying friend, Cæsar finds himself deserted: Brindle, recovered, deserts him in turn, and Cæsar is left alone.\n\nNo evidence is supplied about further legal advice exchanged between Cæsar and Cliff Carlo beyond the single conference described.",
