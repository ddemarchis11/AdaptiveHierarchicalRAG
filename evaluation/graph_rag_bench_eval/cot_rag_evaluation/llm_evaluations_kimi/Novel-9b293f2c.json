    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that no individual is named as king of the Chaldeans, whereas the Gold Answer identifies King Urukh as the king. The retrieved context does mention King Uruck (likely Urukh) in relation to ancient Chaldeans, but the Model Answer fails to utilize this information. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it does not align with the Gold Answer or cover the key fact provided."
