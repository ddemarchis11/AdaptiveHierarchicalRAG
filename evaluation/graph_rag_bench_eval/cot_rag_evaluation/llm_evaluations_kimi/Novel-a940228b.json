  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today was a day of sorrow. My beloved parrot, companion and confidant, was snatched away by envious fate, taken from my side. I said my farewells with heavy heart. In my grief, I called upon Isis, hoping she would turn her features to me and grant comfort. The gods are distant, yet my pain feels as if I am born to be a cause of trouble to my lover.",
  "llm_answer": "Diary of Corinna\n\nThe seventh dawn rose and with it the thread of your life, my little Indian echo, was measured to its last strand.  I held you against my breast while the fever of the final day burned itself out; your bright wings hung like wilted petals and your voice—once the rival of mine—faltered into a single, breaking cry: “Corinna, farewell!”  The word struck deeper than any human grief, for it was the last gift of a tongue more skilled than any other bird’s.\n\nI have set your small body beneath a stone no larger than yourself, carved with the truth that will outlast marble: “From this very tomb I may be judged to have been the favourite of my mistress.”  Let the passer-by read and know that you were loved beyond measure.\n\nYet I do not leave you to darkness.  I have called upon Isis of the seven-mouthed Nile, she who sits in linen before the altars of Memphis and Canopus, to guide your swift spirit.  By the rattle of her sistrum, by the face of gentle Anubis, by the horned Apis who walks in her train, I have begged her to turn her features toward us—toward you, little speaker, and toward me who remain behind.  Grant, O Queen, that my parrot find the Elysian grove reserved for innocent birds, where swans glide guiltless and the Phoenix lives age after age.  There let him range, welcomed among gentle doves and Juno’s peacocks, attracting the harmless flock with the same words that once delighted me.\n\nLive on in that green shade, my echo; I send you under the protection of Isis, and I keep your memory beneath the protection of my tears.",
