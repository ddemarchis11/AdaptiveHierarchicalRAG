    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Raegen wished to hide in the river, which is not supported by the Gold Answer or the Retrieved Context. The Gold Answer specifies that Raegen wanted to hide in the cellar and the garret, and there is no evidence in the context to support the claim about the river."
