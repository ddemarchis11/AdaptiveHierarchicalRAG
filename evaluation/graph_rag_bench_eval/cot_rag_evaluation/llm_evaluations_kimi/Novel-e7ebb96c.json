    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides some relevant details about Ruth and Angeline Stickney's educational journey, such as their shared living expenses and Ruth's return home due to poor health. However, it does not explicitly address Ruth's wish to be with Angeline at McGrawville, which is central to the Gold Answer. Additionally, while some claims are supported by the context, others, like Ruth helping Angeline financially, are not clearly grounded in the retrieved context. The evidence coverage is partial, as the core fact from the Gold Answer is not fully included."
