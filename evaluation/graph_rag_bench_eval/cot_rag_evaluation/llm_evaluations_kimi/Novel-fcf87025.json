  "gold_answer": "Roxie consulted Gov. Morock, Gov. Morock was to pick up the crumbs for Roxie, she was taught the art of penmanship by Ben Robertson, was visited by Aunt Patsy Perkins, and thought of Aunt Patsy.",
  "llm_answer": "Roxie’s relationships with the three named figures are as follows:\n\nGovernor Morock  \n- Roxie consults him about her legal and financial affairs after learning she is “hopelessly destitute and penniless.”  \n- Morock promises to “pick up the crumbs” for her by securing two or three hundred bales of abandoned cotton; he proposes to keep half the proceeds and give her the remainder, calling each bale “only a crumb.”  \n- Roxie listens, affects ignorance of cotton prices, and finally says, “Do the best you can,” then leaves his office. She privately “condemned” the arrangement but did not break the association.\n\nBen Robertson  \n- During her country-school childhood Ben Robertson taught her penmanship; years later, seated at her gilt-edged stationery, she pauses to “thank from the bottom of her heart old Ben Robertson” for that instruction.\n\nAunt Patsy Perkins  \n- Aunt Patsy, a self-styled queen of Chicago “upper-tendom,” visits Roxie in the Daymon palace parlor.  \n- Their talk is chiefly Aunt Patsy’s rapid monologue about her husband’s “dratted poor kin,” her disdain for plain Cousin Sally, and her frustration with old Perkins’s lack of style.  \n- Roxie interjects only once, gently reminding Aunt Patsy that Jim is “kinsfolk on your side of the house,” to which Aunt Patsy replies, “Yes, but honey, I am good to Jim.” No deeper thoughts from Roxie are supplied.",
