  "question": "Within the context of Dragon's Blood, how does revealing that Wutzler is a member of the Triad and introducing the White Lotus as a secret band led by Fang the Sword-Pen serve to deepen Wutzler's character and connect him to the larger web of clandestine organizations operating in the story?",
  "gold_answer": "In one chain, Wutzler is revealed to be a member of the Triad, and White Lotus is described as a secret band led by Fang the Sword-Pen, adding complexity to his character and introducing broader organizational elements to the story.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows that Wutzler’s Triad membership and the revelation of the White Lotus led by Fang the Sword-Pen deepen his character by exposing a hidden, conflicted identity and linking him to the story’s covert power struggles. Wutzler’s shame—he “faltered, and hung his head” when admitting, “I am a Heaven-and-Earth man… The Triad!”—reveals he is neither a simple informant nor a passive victim but someone with a fraught allegiance. His insider knowledge of the White Lotus (“They drink blood—plan blood… I know their lodge-room”) places him at the intersection of two clandestine groups: the Triad he belongs to and the White Lotus he fears. This dual connection embeds him within the larger web of secret societies operating behind the riots and trials, showing his actions are driven by personal stakes in these underground rivalries rather than mere happenstance.",
