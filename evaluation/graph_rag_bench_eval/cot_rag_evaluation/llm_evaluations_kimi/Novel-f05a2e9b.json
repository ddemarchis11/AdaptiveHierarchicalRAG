    "explanation": "The Gold Answer clearly states that Louis intended to return to Paris, which is supported by the retrieved context mentioning his return to Paris after Monte Carlo. The Model Answer incorrectly claims that the evidence does not specify where Louis intended to return, which contradicts both the Gold Answer and the context."
