  "question": "In the narrative describing Hinze's social behavior, how does Hinze interact with both Tulpian and Felicia, particularly in his fervent desire to hear Tulpian's opinions and his manner of engaging in conversation with Felicia?",
  "gold_answer": "Hinze is fervid in his desire to hear Tulpian and actively engages in conversation with Felicia.",
  "llm_answer": "Hinze’s interaction with Tulpian is marked by an almost frantic eagerness to collect every fragment of Tulpian’s opinion; he figuratively “carries about a small spoon ready to pick up any dusty crumb of opinion” the great man drops, pesters bystanders about Tulpian’s fugitive writings, and interrupts experts to ask what they think of Tulpian’s “crotchets.”\n\nWith Felicia, his manner is the same reverent, exaggerated deference: he receives her conventional remarks as though they were oracular, bends his head in “subdued eagerness,” presses her for large judgments (“What, may I ask, is your opinion as to the state of Art in England?”), and even begs permission to repeat her praise to a sculptor.",
