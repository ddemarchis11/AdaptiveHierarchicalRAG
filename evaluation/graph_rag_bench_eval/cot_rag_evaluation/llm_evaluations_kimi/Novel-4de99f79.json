    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that Tregeagle had his dwelling at Dozmare Pool, which is supported by the retrieved context. However, the Gold Answer specifies 'Cornwall' as his dwelling, which is a broader location. While the Model Answer provides a more specific detail, it does not fully align with the Gold Answer's general statement. The retrieved context supports the claim about Dozmare Pool, so faithfulness is high, but evidence coverage is partial as the broader location 'Cornwall' is not explicitly mentioned."
