  "question": "In the manufacture of agglomerated artificial fuel, what substance is coal dust mixed with to create the final product?",
  "gold_answer": "Coal dust is mixed with grains.",

    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that coal dust is mixed with grains, while the Model Answer specifies broken coal pitch. The context supports the Model Answer's claim about coal pitch being added, but it also mentions grains being mixed with coal dust. Thus, the Model Answer is partially correct and faithful to the context but misses the mention of grains, which is a key fact from the Gold Answer."
