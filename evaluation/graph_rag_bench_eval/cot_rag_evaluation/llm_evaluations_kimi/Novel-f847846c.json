  "question": "Imagine you are Young Simon. Write a diary entry about your family connections and your feelings about the events involving your cousin Cæsar and Roxie.",
  "gold_answer": "As the only son of S. S. Simon, I often hear stories about our family. My cousin, Cæsar, has been at the center of recent events, from delivering a note to the Governor to helping Simon learn about Roxie's family. I hear Roxie has been charged, and I worry for her. Our family feels so interconnected, especially with big-sis raising Cæsar and our ties to the Carlow and Brindle families.",
  "llm_answer": "**Diary Entry – Young Simon**  \n*April 6, 1861 – Chicago*  \n\nI am weak, but I must set this down.  \n\nCousin Cæsar has told me everything.  My uncle’s estate—my own inheritance—was never truly mine alone.  Twenty thousand dollars, twenty years of interest, and a tangle of claims stretch from Arkansas to Kentucky.  Roxie, whose laughter I hear in the next room, is one of the heirs.  She does not know the sum, only that “poor trash” may yet have a stake.  I love her for her honesty; she asked no boast of my blood, only listened while I turned the talk, afraid to speak the figure twenty.  \n\nWe are to wed in the spring.  I signed the will this afternoon, every acre, bale, and dollar to Roxie Daymon.  Governor Morock took ten dollars for his trouble; she slipped the note to Cæsar herself.  My cousin’s eyes were wide when he read the papers at dawn—”whole estate… more than a million… to Roxie Daymon.”  He is bewildered, but he will carry out my wish: lay me beside Father on the home plantation.  \n\nI have lived on excitement; now I live on the thought of her.  If the image of Roxie is the last light I see, it is enough.",
