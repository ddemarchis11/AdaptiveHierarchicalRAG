  "question": "Imagine you are Johann Christian Bock. Write a diary entry about your inspiration from Maria of Moulines and your literary achievements.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Jacobi has been a true muse. His story inspired me to pursue my own literary journey, leading to my latest production, 'Die Tagereise'. However, I remain aware of the shifting tides, as Schummel’s lack of influence on my work and the reviews from the Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek suggest our field is ever-changing.",
  "llm_answer": "Diary Entry – 1770\n\nToday I sent to the press the last sheets of my little book, “Die Tagereise.”  As I laid down the quill I felt again the pulse that has beaten in me ever since I first read Yorick’s meeting with Maria of Moulines.  Sterne’s picture of the forsaken girl, her lute, her silent sorrow, set my heart on fire; I knew I must try to transplant that flame into German soil.  So I shaped my traveler after Yorick: he dries the tears of a stranger, questions his own motives, and learns that innocence is its own shield—exactly the lesson Yorick drew beside the _fille de chambre_.  I dared even to name Yorick’s ass, defending the old peasant who weeps for his dead dog, so that no reader can miss whose steps I follow.  The book is slender, but it is the first fruit of my resolve to let German eyes feel what English ones have felt.  If the public receives even a spark of the pity and wonder that Maria of Moulines kindled in me, I shall count the day well spent.",
