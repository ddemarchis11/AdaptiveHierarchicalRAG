    "explanation": "The Model Answer specifies the drawer containing silver teaspoons and a porringer, which is mentioned in the context. However, the Gold Answer states 'boxes' as the objects opened by the man, and the Model Answer does not mention boxes at all. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it fails to align with the Gold Answer and misses the central factual point."
