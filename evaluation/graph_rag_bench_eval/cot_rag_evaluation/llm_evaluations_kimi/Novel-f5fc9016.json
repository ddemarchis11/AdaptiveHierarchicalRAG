  "question": "In the narrative's depiction of poetic inspiration, what figure or concept is described as coming to the Poet?",
  "gold_answer": "Tragedy came to the Poet.",

    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that 'Tragedy came to the Poet,' which is a specific and concise response. The Model Answer instead identifies 'Roman Tragedy' as the figure who comes to the Poet, which is supported by the retrieved context but does not align with the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it fails to capture the core meaning of the Gold Answer and misses the specific fact mentioned in it."
