  "question": "What is the link between Bode’s translation activity and the acceptance of the 'Koran' in Germany?",
  "gold_answer": "Bode translated the 'Koran', which was accepted as genuine in Germany.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows that a 1778 translation of the “Koran” (ascribed—though not with absolute certainty—to Bode) was accepted in Germany as a genuine work by Sterne: the *Almanach der deutschen Musen* praised it, the *Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek* treated it as authentic, and it was reprinted in Sammer’s collected Sterne edition. Thus Bode’s translation activity is linked to the acceptance of the “Koran” in Germany by providing a version that was received as part of Sterne’s oeuvre.",
