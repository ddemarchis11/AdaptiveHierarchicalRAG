  "question": "What is the significance of the mustang in the interactions between Grey and Cota at the Ramierez fonda, considering that Grey threw himself across the mustang and Cota cared only for the horse?",
  "gold_answer": "Grey threw himself across the mustang, and Cota cared only for the horse.",
  "llm_answer": "The mustang is the sole focus of Cota’s concern and the pivot of her power-play with Grey.  \nWhen Grey throws himself across the calico mare to protect Cota, Cota instantly betrays that she “cared only for the horse”: she shoves Grey into the stable, slams the door, and has the peon drive the mustang away, brushing off the danger to Grey with a smiling “Pardon, senor, but I feared she might have kicked you.”  \nThus the mustang’s safety, not Grey’s, is what governs her actions; the horse is the real object of her solicitude and the instrument with which she manipulates and dismisses him.",
