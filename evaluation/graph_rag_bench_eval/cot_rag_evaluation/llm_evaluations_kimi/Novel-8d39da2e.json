    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that the Duke of York was at the Opera, while the Model Answer claims he was at 'the Theatre' during a performance of 'The Joviall Crew.' This directly contradicts the Gold Answer and is not supported by the retrieved context, which does not confirm the venue as 'the Theatre' or the performance as 'The Joviall Crew.' The Model Answer fails to align with the Gold Answer and lacks grounding in the provided context."
