    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the Sultan as holding power over Morocco and mentions his residence in royal cities, particularly Fez. However, it introduces details about his despotic power and role as a final judge in disputes, which are not directly supported by the retrieved context. Additionally, the Gold Answer specifies the Sultan has a palace in Morocco, which is not explicitly mentioned in the Model Answer, leading to partial evidence coverage."
