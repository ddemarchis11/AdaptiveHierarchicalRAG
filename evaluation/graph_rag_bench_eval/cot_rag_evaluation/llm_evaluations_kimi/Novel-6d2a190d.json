    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the retrieved context does not mention any foreign envoy taking leave of the King, which is accurate based on the provided context. However, the Gold Answer specifies that the Portuguese Ambassador took leave of the King, and the Model Answer fails to address this fact, making it incorrect and missing the key evidence. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it does not align with the Gold Answer or provide the required information."
