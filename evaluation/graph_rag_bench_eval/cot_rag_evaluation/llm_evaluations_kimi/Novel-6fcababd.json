  "question": "How is the harp’s presence in British history connected to David’s musical practices?",
  "gold_answer": "David played the lyre and used to suspend the kinnor, which is rendered as harp and is in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows that King David’s favourite instrument, the _kinnor_, was “most likely a lyre if not a small triangular harp,” and Anglo-Saxon manuscripts in the British Museum depict David playing a triangular harp. Thus, the harp’s presence in British history is directly linked to David’s musical practices through these Anglo-Saxon images that present him as a harpist.",
