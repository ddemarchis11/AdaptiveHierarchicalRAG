  "question": "In the scenes where Latimer meets with the bishop to ask for Ellen's hand in marriage, how does the bishop's demeanor reveal both his confidence in Latimer and his role as a judge of Latimer's character and intentions?",
  "gold_answer": "The bishop had confidence in Latimer, spoke with him, and was judging him.",
  "llm_answer": "The bishop’s manner shows both confidence in Latimer and his role as judge in two clear ways:\n\n1. Confidence: He explicitly states, “I like you very much… I know your people and I know you, I think… I am confident of that,” and adds, “I am only too sure you will not be found wanting.” These declarations reveal his pre-existing trust in Latimer’s character.\n\n2. Judge: Mid-discussion his manner shifts; Latimer “saw that he was now facing a judge… and that he was in turn the defendant.” The bishop then requires “a long talk… There are many things I must know,” assuming the authority to test Latimer’s worthiness before granting consent.",
