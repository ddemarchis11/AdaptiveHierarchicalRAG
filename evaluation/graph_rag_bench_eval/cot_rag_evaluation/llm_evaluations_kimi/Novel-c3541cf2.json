  "question": "How does the narrative reveal the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters, specifically through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname George Tidd and Augustin's role as the Dean, and what impact does this have on the unfolding of their personal and social identities?",
  "gold_answer": "Georgiana Tidman uses the nickname George Tidd, and Augustin is also known as the Dean, showing the use of alternate identities among the characters.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative reveals Georgiana Tidman’s adoption of the nickname “George Tidd” as a deliberate, self-chosen racing identity: she proclaims “I am George Tidd—that was my racing name” and backs the claim with concrete tokens (her crimson-and-black handkerchief, the labeled hamper).  This alias is publicly recognised; Sir Tristram speaks of “George Tidd” as a known turf figure and links the name to the stable that produced “Dandy Dick.”  Thus “George Tidd” functions as an assertive, sporting persona that co-exists with, and momentarily overrides, her familial role as the Dean’s sister.\n\nAugustin’s alternate identity is not a nickname but his institutional role: every character, including Georgiana, addresses him simply as “the Dean.”  Within the dialogue this title replaces his personal name, turning him into the embodiment of ecclesiastical authority rather than a private individual.\n\nThe impact on their identities is twofold.  For Georgiana, slipping back into “George Tidd” re-asserts her independence and sporting past against the Deanery’s moral discipline; for Augustin, being addressed only as “the Dean” traps him in a public, clerical mask that constrains his private anxieties (debts, the Spire).  The constant oscillation between these alternate names exposes the tension between personal history and social role, showing how each character uses, or is confined by, a chosen or imposed label to negotiate status within the household and the wider community.",
