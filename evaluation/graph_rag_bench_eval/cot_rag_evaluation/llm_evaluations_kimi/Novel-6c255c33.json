    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the evidence does not specify the title of any literary work read by C. A. S. Hall, which is incorrect as the Gold Answer explicitly mentions 'Prometheus Bound.' While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it fails to provide the correct information and misses the key fact from the Gold Answer."
