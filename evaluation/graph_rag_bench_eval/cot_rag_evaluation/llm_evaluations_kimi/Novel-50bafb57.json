  "question": "How does the East River play a significant role in Rags Raegen's actions and reputation, particularly in instances where he interacts with the river during police chases?",
  "gold_answer": "Rags Raegen had plunged in to rescue the supposedly drowned man in the East River and preferred the East River.",
  "llm_answer": "The East River is central to Rags Raegen’s reputation and tactics: it is his chosen refuge when police pursue him.  \nHe races to the waterfront, dives in, and swims underwater back to the landing-steps while officers and onlookers watch the spot where he vanished.  \nOn one occasion he re-enters the crowd, pretends to help search for “the drowned man,” and for four hours directs the river-police as they drag the bottom with grappling irons.  \nThese exploits make the police believe he has drowned and enhance his legend; when they finally block his access to the river, his usual escape route is cut off.",
