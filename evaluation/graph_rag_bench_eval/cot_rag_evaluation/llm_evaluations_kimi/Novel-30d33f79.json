  "question": "Which series of relationships connects David to the musical instrument santir, considering the involvement of Egyptian musicians?",
  "gold_answer": "David used to suspend the kinnor, which is rendered as harp, found in the British Museum; cymbals in the museum were used by Egyptian musicians; Assyrian musicians played the dulcimer, which is known as santir.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence provided does not establish any series of relationships connecting David to the musical instrument santir, nor does it mention Egyptian musicians in relation to David or the santir. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to answer the question.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide sufficient evidence to establish the relationships connecting David to the santir or Egyptian musicians. However, it fails to address the Gold Answer, which provides a specific chain of relationships involving David, the kinnor, cymbals used by Egyptian musicians, and Assyrian musicians playing the dulcimer (santir). The Model Answer does not contain the core meaning or facts from the Gold Answer, resulting in low correctness and evidence coverage scores."
