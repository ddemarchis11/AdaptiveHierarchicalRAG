    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Washington County, New York, has slate quarries, while the Gold Answer correctly identifies sandstone quarries. The retrieved context does not support the claim of slate quarries in Washington County, making the Model Answer both incorrect and unfaithful to the context. Additionally, the Model Answer fails to include the key fact about sandstone quarries mentioned in the Gold Answer."
