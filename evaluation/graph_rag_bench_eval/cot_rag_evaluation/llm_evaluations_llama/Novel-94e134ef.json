    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies Toser as the city near Mogador, whereas the Gold Answer correctly states Saffee. The retrieved context supports Saffee being near Mogador, specifically mentioning it is one and a half day's journey from Mogador. The Model Answer is neither correct nor faithful to the context, and it fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
