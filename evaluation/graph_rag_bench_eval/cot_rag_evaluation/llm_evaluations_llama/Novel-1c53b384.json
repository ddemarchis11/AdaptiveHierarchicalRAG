  "gold_answer": "Chaacmol had a funeral chamber at Chichen, was studied by Augustus Le Plongeon, and was killed by Aac.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the historical significance of Chaacmol in Maya history is as follows:\n\n1. **Funeral Chamber at Chichen**: Chaacmol's funeral chamber at Chichen-Itza is mentioned in the narrative, indicating that he was an important figure in Maya history. The chamber is described as having mural paintings and bas-reliefs that depict the story of Chaacmol and his sister Moo.\n\n2. **Research Conducted by Augustus Le Plongeon**: Augustus Le Plongeon, a celebrated Indianist, conducted research on the Maya civilization and identified similarities between the story of Chaacmol and Moo and the myth of Osiris and Isis from Egyptian mythology. Le Plongeon believed that the story of Chaacmol and Moo was a mythical account of the Maya culture heroes.\n\n3. **Circumstances of His Death**: Chaacmol was killed by his brother Aac, who stabbed him three times in the back with his spear for jealousy. This event is seen as a mythological account of the conflict between the Sun and Serpent, which was a reality in Mayab.\n\n4. **Symbolism and Significance**: Chaacmol's story is associated with the Sun and Serpent, which were inimical in Mayab. The Sun was Chaacmol's protecting spirit, and his followers rendered homage to it. The Serpent, on the other hand, was associated with Moo and her friends.\n\n5. **Connection to Egyptian Mythology**: The story of Chaacmol and Moo is seen as a mythical account of the Maya culture heroes, similar to the myth of Osiris and Isis from Egyptian mythology. The similarities between the two stories are striking, with Chaacmol and Moo corresponding to Osiris and Isis, and Aac corresponding to Typho.\n\nIn summary, Chaacmol's historical significance in Maya history lies in his association with the Sun and Serpent, his connection to Egyptian mythology, and the mythological account of his death at the hands of his brother Aac.",
