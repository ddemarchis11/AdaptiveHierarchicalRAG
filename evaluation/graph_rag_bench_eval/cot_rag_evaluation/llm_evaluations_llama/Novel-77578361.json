    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect because the context clearly indicates that Snipes said something to the old man that advanced the plot. The Gold Answer is supported by the context, but the Model Answer fails to address the question or provide the relevant information. While the Model Answer does not contradict the context, it does not utilize the available evidence effectively."
