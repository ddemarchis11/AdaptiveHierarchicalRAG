This suggests that he is confident in his ability to make an informed decision.\n\n- The bishop's statement, \"I must confess that for a moment I almost hoped that you might not be able to answer the questions I must ask you, but it was only for a moment,\" implies that he is confident in Latimer's ability to respond to his questions and provide the information he needs.\n\n- The bishop's change in manner, from a plaintiff who has been robbed to a judge, suggests that he is now in a position of authority and is prepared to evaluate Latimer's character and intentions.\n\n- The bishop's statement, \"I like you, I like you very much,\" suggests that he has a positive opinion of Latimer and is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\n- The bishop's willingness to listen to Latimer's responses and to ask follow-up questions suggests that he is genuinely interested in getting to know Latimer and evaluating his character and intentions.\n\nOverall, the bishop's demeanor suggests that he is confident in Latimer's ability to navigate the complexities of their conversation and that he is willing to take on the role of a judge in evaluating Latimer's character and intentions.",
