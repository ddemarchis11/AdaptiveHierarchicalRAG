    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed account of Augustin's involvement but includes unsupported claims, such as the bolus concoction and the racing scandal, which are not clearly grounded in the retrieved context. While it correctly identifies Augustin as The Dean and mentions the horse's nose-bag incident, it misses the fact that Augustin is Sheba's father, as stated in the Gold Answer. The answer partially aligns with the context but introduces speculative or unsupported details."
