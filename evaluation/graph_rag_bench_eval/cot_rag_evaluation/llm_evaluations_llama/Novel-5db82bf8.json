  "llm_answer": "The membership list of the Minnehaha Engine Company, as detailed in the early history of St. Paul's fire department, includes Harry M. Shaw.\n\nEvidence:\n[Novel-10146_c_75] The membership contained the names of John H. Dodge, Porteus Dodge, John E. Missen, Joseph Elfelt, Fred Whipperman, John T. Toal, J.H. Barstow, J.C. Grand, Charles Riehl, John Raguet, E. Rhodes, B. Bradley, Charles Hughes, Bird Boesch, T.F. Masterson, John J. Williams and V. Metzger. During the fall of 1858 a large number of the most prominent business men in the vicinity of Seven Corners joined the organization and continued in active membership until the arrival of the first steamer. In the winter of 1857-1858 Minnehaha Engine. Company No. 2 was organized, and it was provided with an engine house near the corner of Third and Jackson streets. The first officers were H.P. Grant, foreman; M.J. O'Connor and H.B. Terwilliger, assistants; members, Harry M. Shaw, Nicholas Hendy, John B. Oliver, F.A. Cariveau, H.A.\n\n[Novel-10146_c_77] In 1858 the legislature passed an act requiring the sextons of the different churches to ring the church bells fifteen minutes whenever there was an alarm of fire. The uptown churches would ring their bells, the downtown churches would ring their bells, and the churches in the central part of the city would ring their bells. There was a regular banging and clanging of the bells.   \"In the startled air of night,   They would scream out their afright,   Too much horrified to speak,   They could only shriek, shriek,   Out of tune.\" Every one turned out when the fire bells rang. Unless the fire was of sufficient volume to be readily located, the uptown people would be seen rushing downtown, and the downtown people would be seen rushing uptown, in fact, general pandemonium prevailed until the exact location of the fire could be determined. Whenever there was a large fire the regular firemen would soon tire of working on the brakes and they would appeal to the spectators for assistance. The spectators would then rush to the scene of the fire and assist in the work of extinguishing it. The Minnehaha Engine Company was one of the organizations that participated in the annual parade of the St. Paul fire department, which was held on the 12th of September, 1859.",
