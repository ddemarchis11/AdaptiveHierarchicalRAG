  "question": "Is Mogador considered to be part of Morocco, according to the territorial definitions given in the narrative?",
  "gold_answer": "Mogador is part of Morocco.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, it appears that Mogador is indeed considered to be part of Morocco. \n\nIn [Novel-10356_c_116], it is stated that \"The city is well supplied with water from an aqueduct, connecting it with the river Tensift, which flows from the gorges of the Atlas.\" This suggests that Mogador is located near the Atlas mountains and has a connection to the river Tensift, which is likely within the geographical boundaries of Morocco.\n\nAdditionally, in [Novel-10356_c_48], it is mentioned that Mr. Saferty, a Gibraltar merchant, was settled at Mogador, and that the Governor of Mogador was involved in a dispute with him. This implies that Mogador is a place under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Mogador, which is likely part of the Moroccan Empire.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided evidence, it can be concluded that Mogador is considered to be part of Morocco.",
