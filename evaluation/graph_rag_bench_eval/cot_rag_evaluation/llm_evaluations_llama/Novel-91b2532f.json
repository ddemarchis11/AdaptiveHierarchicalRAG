  "question": "During the period of unrest in Minnesota, what patterns of protest and government response emerged, particularly as Indians protested against traders sitting at the government's pay table and the government was accused of neglecting its wards in Minnesota, eventually leading to the state's call to furnish military regiments such as the Sixth regiment?",
  "gold_answer": "Indians protested against traders sitting at the pay table of the government, while the government neglected its wards in Minnesota, leading to ongoing unrest and calls for military intervention.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the following patterns of protest and government response emerged during the period of unrest in Minnesota:\n\n**Patterns of Protest:**\n\n1. Indians protested against permitting traders to sit at the government's pay table and deduct from their small annuities the amount due them.\n2. Indians claimed they were not fairly dealt with by the traders, relying entirely on their word for their indebtedness, and were ignorant of any method of keeping accounts.\n3. Indians protested against the government's neglect of their wards in Minnesota, citing the delay in payment of their annuities.\n4. Indians were dissatisfied with the government's efforts to civilize them, preferring to live as they did before the treaty, going where they pleased, hunting game, and selling fur to traders.\n5. There was a secret organization among the tepee Indians to declare war upon the whites.\n\n**Government Response:**\n\n1. The government built houses for those who desired to occupy them, furnished tools, seed, etc., and taught them how to farm.\n2. The government favored the \"white man's party\" or farmer's party, who believed in cultivating the soil, by providing them with fine houses.\n3. The government was ill-prepared to cope with an outbreak of such magnitude as the one that occurred.\n4. The government called upon Minnesota to furnish five regiments, including the Sixth regiment, in response to the president's call for 600,000 men.\n5. The government was forced to take action against the Indians, with Gen. Sibley's command reaching Camp Release on the 26th of September, in the vicinity of a large camp of Indians who had been engaged in the massacres.\n\nIt is worth noting that the evidence does not provide a clear picture of the government's response to the Indians' protests and grievances, and it is unclear whether the government took any steps to address these issues before the outbreak of violence.",
