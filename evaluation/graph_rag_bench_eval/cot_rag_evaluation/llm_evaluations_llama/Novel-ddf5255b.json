  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, here's how Papineau's actions during the period leading up to and following the Ninety-Two Resolutions affected his relationship with John Neilson, including Neilson's opposition to the resolutions, his eventual break with Papineau, and his alignment with Augustin Cuvillier:\n\nPapineau's domineering behavior and revolutionary views alienated some of his followers, including John Neilson. Neilson, who had initially supported Papineau, began to oppose him due to Papineau's actions. Specifically, Neilson objected to the expulsion of Mondelet from the House, opposed the resolutions of Louis Bourdages for the abolition of the Legislative Council, and rebuked Papineau for language he used in the debate on Quesnel's bill for the independence of judges.\n\nAs a result of Papineau's actions, Neilson, along with Augustin Cuvillier, Andrew Stuart, and F. A. Quesnel, broke away from Papineau's party. The Ninety-Two Resolutions, which Papineau inspired, further alienated Neilson and the others, who voted against the resolutions in the minority.\n\nThe passage of the Ninety-Two Resolutions led to a general election, which revealed the strength of Papineau's position in the country. However, those who opposed the Resolutions, including Neilson and Cuvillier, suffered defeat at the polls. Despite this, Papineau's party still had a majority behind him, and he continued to exercise significant influence over the Assembly.\n\nThe Ninety-Two Resolutions also led to a withdrawal of support from Papineau among the Catholic clergy and other groups, who were disturbed by the revolutionary and republican ideas advocated by Papineau. This further eroded Papineau's relationship with Neilson and others who had initially supported him.\n\nIn summary, Papineau's actions during the period leading up to and following the Ninety-Two Resolutions led to a breakdown in his relationship with John Neilson, who eventually broke away from Papineau's party and aligned himself with Augustin Cuvillier and others who opposed Papineau's revolutionary views.",
