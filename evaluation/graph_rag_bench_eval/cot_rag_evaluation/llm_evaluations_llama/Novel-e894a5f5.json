  "llm_answer": "The Devil's Frying-pan is geographically related to the village of Cadgwith in that it is located near the village. \n\nSpecifically, it is described as being near Cadgwith in the following passages:\n\n- \"The principal thing to be seen at Cadgwith. The Devil's Frying-pan, near Cadgwith.\" (Novel-44557_c_51)\n- \"Illustration: THE DEVIL'S FRYING PAN, NEAR CADGWITH.\" (Novel-44557_c_52)\n- \"The Devil's Frying-pan looked, within and without, much as it must have looked for the last hundred years; and the ragged, unkempt, tongue-tied little girl, from whom we succeeded in getting a drink of milk in a tumbler which she took five minutes to search for, had certainly never been to a Board School. She investigated the penny which we deposited as if it were a great natural curiosity rarely attainable, and she gazed after us as we climbed the stile leading to the Frying-pan as if wondering what on earth could tempt respectable people, who had nothing to do, into such a very uncomfortable place.\" (Novel-44557_c_52)\n\nThis suggests that the Devil's Frying-pan is a nearby attraction or landmark that can be seen from Cadgwith.",
