It is also referred to as \"Hell's Mouth\" by some locals. \n\nThe Devil's Throat is situated near Asparagus Island, which is described as \"easy enough climbing.\" However, the Devil's Throat itself is not recommended for climbing, as it involves a \"good jump\" and can be hazardous if one misses their footing. \n\nThe Devil's Throat is located near Kynance Cove, which is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.
