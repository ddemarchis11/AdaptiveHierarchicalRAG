    "explanation": "The Model Answer 'Insufficient evidence' does not address the question or provide any relevant information. The Gold Answer clearly states that Hypsipyle received a sad letter from Jason, which is supported by the Retrieved Context. The Model Answer fails to engage with the context or the Gold Answer, resulting in a score of 0 across all metrics."
