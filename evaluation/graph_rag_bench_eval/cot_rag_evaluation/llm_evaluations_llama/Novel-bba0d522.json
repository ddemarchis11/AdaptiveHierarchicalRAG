    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies the Fans as the group described by Du Chaillu, while the Model Answer includes the Fans but also lists numerous other groups and tribes, some of which are not directly described by Du Chaillu in the retrieved context. This dilutes the focus on the Fans and introduces unsupported claims. While the Fans are mentioned, the inclusion of other groups reduces evidence coverage and faithfulness to the context."
