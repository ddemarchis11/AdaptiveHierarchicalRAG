  "question": "How did the French Canadians' loyalty to the British crown manifest in times of war?",
  "gold_answer": "French Canadians were loyal to the British crown, which had loyalty from French-Canadian militiamen who fought with English-speaking fellow-countrymen.",
  "llm_answer": "The French Canadians' loyalty to the British crown manifested in times of war as follows:\n\n1. During the Napoleonic wars, the sympathies of Canada were almost wholly with Great Britain. When news arrived of the defeat of the French fleet at Trafalgar, a Te Deum was sung in the Catholic cathedral at Quebec, and a future bishop of the French-Canadian Church enunciated the principle that 'all events which tend to broaden the gap separating us from France should be welcome.'\n\n2. In the War of 1812-14, French-Canadian militiamen under French-Canadian officers fought shoulder to shoulder with their English-speaking fellow-countrymen on several stricken fields of battle. The most striking manifestation of French-Canadian loyalty to the British crown appeared during this war, where French-Canadian soldiers, led by Major de Salaberry, won a heroic victory at Chateauguay.\n\n3. A quarter of a century after the War of 1812, the two races which had fought side by side were now arrayed against each other. French-Canadian veterans of Chateauguay were on one side, and English-Canadian veterans of Chrystler's Farm on the other. Despite this, the French-Canadian rebels repulsed a force of British regulars at the village of St Denis, and brisk skirmishes took place at the villages of St Charles and St Eustache.\n\n4. The British government's conciliatory policy, which granted the French Canadians equal political rights, the free exercise of their religion, and the whole of the French civil law, helped to keep the clergy, the seigneurs, and the great body of French Canadians loyal to the British crown during the war in 1775 and in 1812.",
