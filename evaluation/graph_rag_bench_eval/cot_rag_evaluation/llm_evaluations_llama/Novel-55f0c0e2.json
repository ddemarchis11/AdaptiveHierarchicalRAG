    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that there is insufficient evidence, despite the retrieved context clearly describing an incident where Samuel Pepys met the Duke of York following an order to account for the delay in sending out ships. This directly relates to Pepys's professional responsibilities and the question asked. The Model Answer fails to address the core truth of the Gold Answer and does not utilize the relevant context provided."
