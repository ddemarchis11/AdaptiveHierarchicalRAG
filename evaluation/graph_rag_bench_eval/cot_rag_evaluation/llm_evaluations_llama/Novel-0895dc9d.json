    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Kairwan, Sidi Amour Abeda, and Toser as locations visited by Captain Balfour, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it includes additional locations not mentioned in the Gold Answer or clearly supported by the Retrieved Context, such as Nefta, Ghafsa, and others. While the Model Answer elaborates on the Bey's protection, some claims about the Bey's influence and activities are not explicitly grounded in the context provided. This results in partial correctness and faithfulness, as well as incomplete evidence coverage due to the inclusion of unsupported details."
