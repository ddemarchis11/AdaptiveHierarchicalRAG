    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies 'boxes' as the objects opened by the man, but the Model Answer mentions 'the cupboard' and 'a mutton-bone,' which are supported by the context. However, the Model Answer does not explicitly mention 'boxes,' which is the key fact from the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it partially aligns with the Gold Answer and misses the specific mention of 'boxes.'"
