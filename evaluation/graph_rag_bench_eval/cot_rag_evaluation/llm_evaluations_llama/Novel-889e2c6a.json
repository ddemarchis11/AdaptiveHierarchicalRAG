  "llm_answer": "The city of Rabat is historically connected to Yakob-el-Mansour, a famous Sultan, who built the city and named it Rabat-el-Fatah, or \"camp of victory.\" \n\nThe novel does not provide direct information about Yakob-el-Mansour's influence over Western Barbary. However, it does mention that the Sultan is the head of the orthodox religion of the Mussulmen of the West and is more firmly established on his throne than the Sultan of the Ottomans. It also states that the Sultan's influence, as a sovereign Shereef, spreads throughout Western Barbary and Central Africa, wherever there is a Mussulman to be found.",
