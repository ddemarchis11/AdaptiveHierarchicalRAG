    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect. The Gold Answer specifies that Rudolph confessed to Heywood, and this is a factual point that could have been addressed. The retrieved context does not provide direct evidence to support the Gold Answer, but the Model Answer fails to utilize internal knowledge or provide any relevant information, resulting in a score of 0 across all metrics."
