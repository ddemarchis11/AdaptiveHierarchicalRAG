  "question": "How is the movement of the Itzaes explained with respect to the Nahualt and the invasion of MAYAB?",
  "gold_answer": "The Itzaes, who spoke Maya, retreated before the Nahualt, who later invaded MAYAB.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the movement of the Itzaes is explained as follows with respect to the Nahualt and the invasion of MAYAB:\n\nThe Itzaes, along with other tribes, retreated before the Nahualt invaders after the surrender and destruction of their cities. They sought refuge in the islands of the lake Peten of to-day, which they called Petenitza, the islands of the Itzaes, or in the well nigh inaccessible valleys, defended by ranges of towering mountains. \n\nThis indicates that the Itzaes were forced to flee their original locations due to the invasion of the Nahualt, and they found refuge in remote areas.",
