    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed account of events involving Miss Trotter, Frida Jansen, and the Summit House, but it does not clearly state that Miss Trotter resigned from the Summit House, which is a key fact in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the claim that Miss Trotter may have been considering resignation due to the situation with Frida Jansen and Mr. Calton is not supported by the retrieved context. While the Model Answer includes relevant details, it misses the core relationship described in the Gold Answer and introduces speculative elements not grounded in the context."
