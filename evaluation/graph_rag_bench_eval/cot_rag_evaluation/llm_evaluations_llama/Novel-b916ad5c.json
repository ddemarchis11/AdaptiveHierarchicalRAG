  "gold_answer": "The kinnor is rendered as harp, which is in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript that is in the British Museum, which also has cymbals.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that there is insufficient evidence to link the kinnor to the British Museum's collection of cymbals, whereas the Gold Answer provides a clear chain of evidence: the kinnor is rendered as a harp in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript housed in the British Museum, which also contains cymbals. The Model Answer fails to address this connection and does not utilize the retrieved context to support its claim."
