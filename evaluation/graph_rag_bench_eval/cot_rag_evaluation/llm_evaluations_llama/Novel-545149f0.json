  "llm_answer": "According to the discussion in the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER about bone flexibility, children's bones are more flexible and able to bend easily compared to the bones of old people because they contain more gristle. Gristle is a soft, smooth fluid that keeps the bones moist and makes them work easily. Children's bones have more gristle than those of older people, which allows them to bend easily.",
