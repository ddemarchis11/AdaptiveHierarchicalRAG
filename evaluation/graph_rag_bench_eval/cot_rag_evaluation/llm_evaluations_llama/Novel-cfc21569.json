  "question": "When Raegen is fleeing the police after a violent encounter, where does he wish to hide in order to avoid being caught, and why does he consider these locations safe?",
  "gold_answer": "Raegen wanted to lie hidden in his own cellar and his own garret.",
  "llm_answer": "Insufficient evidence to answer the question.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect. The Gold Answer specifies that Raegen wanted to hide in his own cellar and garret, and this information is not addressed or acknowledged by the Model Answer. Additionally, the Retrieved Context does not provide relevant information to support the Gold Answer, but the Model Answer fails to utilize internal knowledge to provide a correct response."
