    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Toser as a city visited by Captain Balfour and notes the presence of Moorish baths, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it includes additional details about the city's history, architecture, and cultural significance that are not explicitly supported by the retrieved context. While these details may be accurate, they are not grounded in the provided context, reducing faithfulness. Additionally, the Model Answer does not explicitly mention all key facts from the Gold Answer, such as the simplicity of the statement about Captain Balfour's visit and the baths, which impacts evidence coverage."
