  "question": "Throughout Dragon's Blood, what does the recurring portrayal of Rudolph trembling in the presence of Heywood suggest about the nature of their interpersonal dynamic, and how does this reaction inform the reader about power relations or emotional tension between these two characters in various narrative situations?",
  "gold_answer": "Rudolph’s consistent trembling in Heywood’s presence suggests a persistent power imbalance or sense of intimidation, which frames the subsequent events across all chains.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question and does not align with the Gold Answer or the Retrieved Context. It incorrectly states that there is insufficient evidence, whereas the Gold Answer clearly interprets Rudolph's trembling as indicative of a power imbalance or intimidation. The Retrieved Context does not provide direct support for the Gold Answer, but the Model Answer does not utilize any relevant information or internal knowledge to address the question either."
