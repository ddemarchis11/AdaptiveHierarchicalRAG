    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies that Van Bibber saw Standish, which is correct. The Model Answer adds that the companion was a young lady, which is supported by the context but not explicitly mentioned in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is partially correct, it introduces additional details that are not central to the Gold Answer, leading to partial evidence coverage."
