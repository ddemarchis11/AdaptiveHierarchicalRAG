    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Van Bibber came face to face with a burglar, which is not supported by the retrieved context or the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer specifies that Van Bibber encountered her brother near the swan-boats in Central Park, and the retrieved context does not provide evidence for the burglar encounter in this specific scenario."
