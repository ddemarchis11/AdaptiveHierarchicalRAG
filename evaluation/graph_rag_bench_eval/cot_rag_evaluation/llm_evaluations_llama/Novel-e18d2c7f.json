    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Dr. O'Shaughnessy spoke to Dennis Macarthy, but the Model Answer incorrectly identifies Eily (Eileen) as the person he spoke to. While the Model Answer is grounded in the retrieved context, it fails to align with the Gold Answer and misses the key factual point about Dennis Macarthy."
