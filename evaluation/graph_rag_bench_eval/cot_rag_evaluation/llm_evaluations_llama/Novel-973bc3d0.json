    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not contain information about Asaph Hall helping protect Wendell Phillips or any other individual during a public event in Boston. However, the Model Answer fails to provide the correct response to the question, which is that Asaph Hall helped protect Wendell Phillips, as stated in the Gold Answer. The retrieved context does not support the Gold Answer, but the Model Answer does not use external knowledge to address the question either."
