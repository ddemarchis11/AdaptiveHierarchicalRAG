He carried water for the office, met boats to collect newspapers, and was a half-carrier staff member. When the Pioneer Press absorbed the Minnesotian in 1861, Moore went with it, and later when the Press and Pioneer were united in 1874, he stayed with the merged paper.\n\nDuring his service in the Civil War, Moore's experience in journalism likely influenced his role in the war effort. However, the specific details of his military service are not mentioned in the provided evidence.\n\nAfter the war, Moore returned to his position at the Pioneer Press, where he had grown with the paper and held an important position as the head of the composing room for about forty years.",
