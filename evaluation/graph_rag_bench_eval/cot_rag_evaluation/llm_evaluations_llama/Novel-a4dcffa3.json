    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that there is insufficient evidence to answer the question, but the retrieved context does mention that Romans mixed water with wine, specifically referencing the role of a servant tasked with mixing wine and water to the taste of the guests. This directly answers the user's question and aligns with the Gold Answer. The Model Answer fails to utilize the relevant information from the context."
