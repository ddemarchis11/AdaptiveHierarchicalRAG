  "llm_answer": "Earle S. Goodrich's involvement with the Pioneer and the Minnesotian was as follows:\n\n- He was the editor of the Pioneer.\n- He prepared a huge joke on the Minnesotian by creating bogus telegraph news, including a two-column speech purporting to have been made by William H. Seward in the senate just previous to the breaking out of the war.\n- He had the Pioneer printed with the bogus news and distributed it to the Minnesotian, who then distributed it throughout the city.\n- The joke was so convincing that the Minnesotian was taken in and distributed the bogus news to its readers.\n- The Times, another newspaper in St. Paul, also fell victim to the joke and set up the bogus news from the Minnesotian, but then quickly corrected themselves and circulated both the bogus and regular news, making fun of the Minnesotian for being so easily taken in.\n- The Pioneer retained the monopoly of the news until the Press was started, on the 1st of January, 1861.\n- Earle S. Goodrich also came up into the composing room when the old Press removed from Bridge Square in 1869 to the new building on the corner of Third and Minnesota streets, and requested the privilege of setting the first type in the new building.",
