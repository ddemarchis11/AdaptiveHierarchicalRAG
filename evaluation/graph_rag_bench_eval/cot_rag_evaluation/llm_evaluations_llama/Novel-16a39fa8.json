    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that C. A. S. HALL was engaged with 'Prometheus Bound' and 'Prometheus Unbound,' which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it includes additional literary works ('Faust,' 'Romola,' 'The Channel Islands,' Mrs. Stanton's writings, and Taine's writings) that are mentioned in the context but are not directly relevant to the question about 'Prometheus Bound' and 'Prometheus Unbound.' While these details are grounded in the context, they dilute the focus on the specific works mentioned in the Gold Answer, leading to partial evidence coverage and reduced faithfulness."
