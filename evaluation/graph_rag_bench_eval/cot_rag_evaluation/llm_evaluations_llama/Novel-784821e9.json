    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that the Bey carried a present to the Britannic Majesty, which is explicitly supported by the retrieved context. However, the Model Answer incorrectly claims that the evidence does not mention who carried the present, failing to acknowledge the relevant information in the context. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context in its claim, it does not correctly address the question or include the key fact from the Gold Answer."
