    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not correctly identify the huehuetl and teponaztli as the musical instruments used by the Aztecs, which are explicitly stated in the Gold Answer. Instead, it lists a variety of instruments, many of which are not supported by the retrieved context as being Aztec-specific or relevant to the question. The claims made in the Model Answer are largely unsupported or speculative based on the context provided, leading to a lack of faithfulness and evidence coverage."
