  "question": "According to the text, what roles does the Sultan hold in relation to Morocco, including his power over the country and his residence in a palace within Morocco?",
  "gold_answer": "The Sultan has power over Morocco and has a palace in Morocco.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the following roles and power of the Sultan in relation to Morocco can be determined:\n\n1. **Residence in a palace within Morocco**: The Sultan generally resides in Fez, but there is also a mention of the royal family residing at Tafilett, which is the ancient country of the Shereefs. However, it is not explicitly stated that the Sultan resides in Tafilett.\n\n2. **Power over the country**: The Sultan has limited power over the provinces of the south (Sous and Wadnoun), where he has no real power. He also exercises a precarious sovereignty over the Rif, or the northern Berber provinces, where every man's gun or knife is his law and authority.\n\n3. **Governor of Fez**: The Sultan's son, Sidi Mohammed, is the Governor of Fez.\n\n4. **Governor of Rabat**: The Sultan's another son is the Governor of Rabat.\n\n5. **Final judge in disputes**: The Sultan is the final judge in disputes between English subjects and Moors, as well as between Moors and English subjects in English territories.\n\n6. **Despotism over his subjects**: The Sultan has unbounded attributes of despotism over his own subjects, who are considered his Abeed, or slaves.\n\n7. **Limited influence in the south**: The Sultan's influence in the south is limited, and the region is cut off as an integral portion of the empire.\n\n8. **Maintaining allegiance of the north country**: The Sultan's presence is necessary to maintain the allegiance of the north country, and to curb its powerful warparty.\n\n9. **Right to the throne**: The Sultan is the rightful ruler of Morocco, and his dynasty belongs to Morocco, not Fez.\n\n10. **Successor to the Arabian Sovereigns of Spain**: The Sultan is the successor to the Arabian Sovereigns of Spain, and may justly dispute the Caliphat with the Osmanlis, or Turkish Sultans.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed account of the Sultan's roles and powers, but it includes several claims that are not explicitly supported by the retrieved context, such as the Sultan's despotism and his role as the successor to the Arabian Sovereigns of Spain. While the Gold Answer is concise, the Model Answer misses the simplicity and clarity of the Sultan's power over Morocco and his residence in a palace within Morocco, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the Model Answer introduces unsupported details and does not focus adequately on the core facts from the Gold Answer."
