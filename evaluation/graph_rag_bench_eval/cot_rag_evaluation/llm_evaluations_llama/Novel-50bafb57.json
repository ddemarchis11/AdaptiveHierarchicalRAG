  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the East River plays a significant role in Rags Raegen's actions and reputation, particularly in instances where he interacts with the river during police chases. \n\nRags Raegen is described as being at his best in the water, particularly in the East River. He has a history of diving into the river to escape from the police, leaving them staring in alarm. On one occasion, he even swam back underwater to the landing steps, while the policeman and a crowd of stevedores watched for him to reappear where he had sunk. This aquatic prowess has contributed to his reputation and has been a significant factor in his ability to evade capture.\n\nIn one instance, Rags even used his knowledge of the river to his advantage by directing the river-police's search for his \"corpse\" after he had dived into the water. He sat on the wharf and directed their movements, leading them to search the river-bed around Wakeman's Slip for four hours, while he remained hidden.\n\nThe East River has become an integral part of Rags' escape tactics and has contributed to his notoriety and reputation as a cunning and resourceful individual.",
