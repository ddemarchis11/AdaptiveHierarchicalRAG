  "question": "After the journey through the rain and the eventful stop due to the fallen tree, where did the stagecoach carrying Yuba Bill and the passengers finally arrive?",
  "gold_answer": "The coach arrived at the station.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer claims that the context does not explicitly state the final destination of the stagecoach, which contradicts the Gold Answer that specifies the coach arrived at the station. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it fails to provide the correct answer and misses the key fact mentioned in the Gold Answer."
