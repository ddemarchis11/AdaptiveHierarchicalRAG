    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about General Pearce's army or its origin, which is faithful to the context. However, the Gold Answer specifies that General Pearce's army was from Arkansas, and the Model Answer fails to include this fact, resulting in a score of 0 for correctness and evidence coverage."
