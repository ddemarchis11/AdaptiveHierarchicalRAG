  "question": "In the chapter where Trost discusses technological advancement, how does the text describe the relationship between the human organism and the machine, especially with regard to the idea that the machine is an extension of the human organism?",
  "gold_answer": "The machine is described as an extension of the human organism.",
  "llm_answer": "The text describes the relationship between the human organism and the machine as one of extension and interdependence. According to Trost, machines are \"simply extensions of the human organism, so to speak, limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more subtle finger-tips, ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the invisibly small.\" This suggests that machines are an extension of human capabilities, rather than a replacement for them.\n\nTrost also emphasizes that machines depend on humans for their operation and maintenance. He states that \"each new machine needs a new appliance of human skill to construct it, new devices to feed it with material, and often keener-edged faculties to note its registrations or performances.\" This highlights the interdependence between humans and machines, and suggests that humans are necessary for the development and operation of machines.\n\nFurthermore, Trost argues that machines will not supersede humans, but rather will free humans from grosser labor, allowing them to engage in more refined and subtle thinking processes. He states that \"the subtly refined powers of machines will react in producing more subtly refined thinking processes which will occupy the minds set free from grosser labour.\" This suggests that the relationship between humans and machines is one of mutual enhancement, rather than replacement.",
