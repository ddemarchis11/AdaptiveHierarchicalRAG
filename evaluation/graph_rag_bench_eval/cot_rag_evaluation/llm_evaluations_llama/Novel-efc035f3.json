    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to correctly identify Miss Inglis as the recipient of Mrs. B.'s remarks, which is explicitly stated in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context in describing Dr. Inglis's kindness and care, it does not address the specific question or include the key fact from the Gold Answer."
