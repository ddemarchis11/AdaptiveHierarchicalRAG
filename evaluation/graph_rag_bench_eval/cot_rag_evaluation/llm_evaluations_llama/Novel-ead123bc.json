  "llm_answer": "The connections described between the region of Cilicia, the poet Aratus, and the critical view held by Quintilian are as follows:\n\n1. Cilicia is described as a region in Asia Minor that was formerly a center of piracy until Pompey suppressed it (Footnote 468).\n2. Aratus is mentioned as a native of Cilicia (Footnote 228).\n3. Aratus is described as a Greek poet who wrote some astronomical poems, including \"Phænomena,\" which still exists (Footnote 228).\n4. Quintilian is mentioned as condemning Aratus' style, although it is praised by Ovid (Footnote 228).\n\nThere is no direct connection described between Cilicia and the critical view held by Quintilian, but rather a connection between Cilicia and Aratus, and then a connection between Aratus and Quintilian's critical view.",
