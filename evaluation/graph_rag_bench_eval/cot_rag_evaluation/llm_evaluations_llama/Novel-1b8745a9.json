    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect. The Gold Answer clearly identifies Asaph Hall as the person Angeline Hall pleaded with during a difficult period, and this is supported by the retrieved context. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and does not utilize the context effectively."
