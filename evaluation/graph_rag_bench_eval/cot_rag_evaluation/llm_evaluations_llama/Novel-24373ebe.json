  "gold_answer": "Cybele had priests called Galli, and her original priests were called Corybantes.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the relationship between the goddess Cybele and her priests, specifically the Galli and the Corybantes, is as follows:\n\nThe Galli, who were the priests of Cybele, performed her rites in imitation of the Corybantes, the original priests of Cybele. They did this by playing pipes and tambourines and running to and fro in a frenzied manner. This suggests that the Galli were a continuation of the Corybantes, and that they maintained a similar tradition of worship and ritual.\n\nThere is no further information in the provided evidence about the specific relationship between Cybele and her priests, or about the Galli and the Corybantes beyond this description of their rituals.",
