  "gold_answer": "Burnouses include blankets and quilts.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that there is insufficient evidence to determine the items included alongside burnouses, which is incorrect. The Gold Answer clearly specifies that burnouses include blankets and quilts. The Retrieved Context does not provide relevant information about burnouses, but the Model Answer fails to use internal knowledge to provide the correct answer, resulting in a score of 0 across all metrics."
