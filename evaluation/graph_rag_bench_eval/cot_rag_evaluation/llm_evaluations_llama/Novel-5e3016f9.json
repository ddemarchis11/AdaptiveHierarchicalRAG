  "question": "In the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, what is the relationship between the heart and blood in distributing nutrients, specifically how does the heart pump blood and how does the blood carry food throughout the body?",
  "gold_answer": "The heart pumps blood, and blood carries food.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, here are the answers to the question:\n\n1. The relationship between the heart and blood in distributing nutrients is that the heart pumps blood throughout the body, and the blood carries food to every part of the body.\n\n2. How the heart pumps blood: The heart works by pumping blood through tubes, shaped like hoses, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the body. These tubes are called arteries. The heart pumps the blood by the working of its strong muscles.\n\n3. How the blood carries food throughout the body: The blood takes up the prepared food from the stomach and carries it to every part of the body. It then leaves with each part, just what it needs.\n\n4. The blood is made pure and red again in the lungs. The lungs take in fresh air, and by taking out what is bad, they prepare the blood to go back to the heart pure and red, and to be pumped out through the body again.\n\n5. The blood is sent from the lungs to the heart, and then the heart pumps it out with the blood into the lungs and then all through the body.\n\n6. The blood carries food to every part of the body, including bone, muscle, skin, hair, eyes, and brain. It also helps to mend any parts that may be broken.\n\n7. The relationship between the heart and lungs is that the heart pumps blood into the lungs, and the lungs take in fresh air and prepare the blood to go back to the heart pure and red.\n\n8. The heart rests between beats, getting an instant of rest.\n\n9. Good exercise in the fresh air makes the heart work well and warms the body better than a fire could do.\n\n10. Alcohol harms the heart by making it beat too fast, and so it gets too tired.",
