  "question": "What is the link between Bode’s translation activity and the acceptance of the 'Koran' in Germany?",
  "gold_answer": "Bode translated the 'Koran', which was accepted as genuine in Germany.",
  "llm_answer": "There is no direct link between Bode's translation activity and the acceptance of the 'Koran' in Germany.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that there is no direct link between Bode's translation activity and the acceptance of the 'Koran' in Germany, which contradicts the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer clearly states that Bode translated the 'Koran,' which was accepted as genuine in Germany. Furthermore, the Retrieved Context does not provide any information to support the Model Answer's claim, making it unfaithful and lacking evidence coverage."
