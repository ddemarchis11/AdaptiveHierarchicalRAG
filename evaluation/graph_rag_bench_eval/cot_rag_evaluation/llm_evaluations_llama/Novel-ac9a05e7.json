  "gold_answer": "Tierra de Guerra is located between Guatemala, Tabasco, Chiapas and Yucatan.",

  "scores": {

    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that there is insufficient evidence to determine the regions between which Tierra de Guerra is situated, but the Gold Answer clearly specifies the regions as Guatemala, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Yucatan. The retrieved context does not directly confirm the Gold Answer but does not contradict it either. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and does not align with the Gold Answer or the context."
