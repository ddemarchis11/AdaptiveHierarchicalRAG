Steve Brindle had saved Cousin Cæsar's life and had been an old comrade in many hard games.

    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed portrayal of Cousin Cæsar's involvement in military affairs and family relationships, but it includes unsupported claims and misinterpretations. While it correctly mentions his service under General Price and his close counsel with Cliff Carlo, it inaccurately describes the circumstances of being left alone by Steve Brindle, as the context does not support the claim that Steve Brindle left him alone after saving his life. Additionally, the portrayal of Steve Brindle's treachery is not explicitly grounded in the retrieved context. The Model Answer partially aligns with the Gold Answer but introduces extraneous and unsupported details, reducing its faithfulness and evidence coverage."
