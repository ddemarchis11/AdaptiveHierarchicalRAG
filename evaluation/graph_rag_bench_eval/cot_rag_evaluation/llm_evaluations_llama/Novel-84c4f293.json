    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies that Mr. Pepys arranged a collation for 'Sir Williams,' which is supported by the context. The Model Answer correctly identifies this but also includes additional guests and events that are not explicitly tied to the question or supported by the retrieved context. While some of these details are grounded in the context, they are not directly relevant to the specific question about the collation for Sir Williams, leading to partial correctness and faithfulness. Evidence coverage is also partial as the core fact about 'Sir Williams' is included, but extraneous details dilute the focus."
