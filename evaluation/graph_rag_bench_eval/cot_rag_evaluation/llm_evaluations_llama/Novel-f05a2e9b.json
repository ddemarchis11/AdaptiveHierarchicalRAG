    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect. The Gold Answer clearly states that Louis intended to return to Paris, and this is supported by the Retrieved Context mentioning Louis driving back to Paris after his experiences in Monte Carlo. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and does not utilize the relevant context."
