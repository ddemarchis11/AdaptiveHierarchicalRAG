    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the retrieved context does not contain information about what Ulysses received from Æolus. In fact, the context explicitly mentions that Æolus gave Ulysses favourable wind sewn up in a leather bag to aid his return to Ithaca. The Model Answer fails to address the question and disregards the relevant information present in the context."
