  "question": "How does the narrative chain connect Cornwall's legendary expression to Arthur and his associates, particularly through Arthur's relationship with Sir Bedevere and the pivotal event of Excalibur being thrown away?",
  "gold_answer": "Cornwall is said to find its legendary expression in Arthur, who is connected to Sir Bedivere and pivotal events like the throwing of Excalibur, tying the region's narrative identity to Arthurian legend.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative chain is forged in three explicit steps:\n\n1. Arthur’s mortal defeat at Camelford drives him to command his “last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere” to carry him to the shore of Dozmare Pool and there “throw in … his sword Excalibur.”  \n2. Bedevere’s obedience to this order—he “threw Excalibur into the mere”—is the pivotal act that immediately summons the mysterious boat bearing three queens who bear the wounded king away.  \n3. This single act of loyalty by Bedevere thus binds the Cornish locality (Dozmare Pool) to the legendary expression of Arthur’s departure, making the knight’s fidelity the indispensable link between the king and the immortal tradition that “he will reappear in latter days.”",

One by one, his best knights fell away into sin, and his nephew Mordred raised a rebellion, fought with him, and conquered him at Camelford. Seeing his end was near, Arthur bade his last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere, carry him to the shore of a mere (supposed to be Dozmare Pool) and throw in there his sword Excalibur; when appeared a boat with three queens, who lifted him in, mourning over him. With them he sailed away across the mere, to be healed of his grievous wound. Some say that he was afterwards buried in a chapel near, others declare that he lives still in fairy land, and will reappear in latter days, to reinstate the Order of Knights of the Round Table, and rule his beloved England, which will then be perfect as he once tried to make it, but in vain. Camelford of to-day is certainly not the Camelot of King Arthur--but a very respectable, commonplace little town, much like other country towns; the same genteel linendrapers' and un-genteel ironmongers' shops; the same old-established commercial inn, and a few ugly, but solid-looking private houses, with their faces to the street and their backs nestled in gardens and fields. Some of the inhabitants of these said houses were to be",

We read the \"Idylls of the King\" all through, finishing with \"The Passing of Arthur,\" where the \"bold Sir Bedivere\" threw Excalibur into the mere--which is supposed to be Dozmare Pool. Here King Arthur's faithful lover was so melted--for the hundredth time--by the pathos of the story, and by many old associations, that the younger and more practical minds grew scornful, and declared that probably King Arthur had never existed at all--or if he had, was nothing but a rough barbarian, unlike even the hero of Sir Thomas Malory, and far more unlike the noble modern gentleman of Tennyson's verse. Maybe: and yet, seeing that \"'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all,\" may it not be better to have believed in an impossible ideal man, than to accept contentedly a low ideal, and worship blindly the worldly, the mean, or the base? This topic furnished matter for so much hot argument, that, besides doing a quantity of needlework, we succeeded in making our one wet day by no means the least amusing of our seventeen days in Cornwall.

The beneficence of our kind hosts, however, was not nearly done. \"Come, ladies, I'll show you my garden, and--(give me a basket and the grape-scissors,)\" added he in a conjugal aside. Which resulted in our carrying away with us the biggest bunches in the whole vinery, as well as a quantity of rosy apples, stuffed into every available pocket and bag. \"Nonsense, nonsense,\" was the answer to vain remonstrances. \"D'ye think I wouldn't give the best of everything I had to your family? and so would my missis too. How your father used to laugh at me about my little maid! But he understood it for all that. Oh yes, I'm glad I came home. And now your father and your uncle are home too, and perhaps some day they'll come to see me down here--wouldn't it be a proud day for me! You'll tell them so?\" It was touching, and rare as touching, this passionate personal fidelity. It threw us back, at least such of us as were sentimentally inclined, upon that something in Cornish nature which found its exposition in Arthur and his faithful knights, down to \"bold Sir Bedevere,\" and apparently, is still not lost in Cornwall.

Geographers call Little Atlas the secondary mountains of the land of Sous, in opposition to the name of Great Atlas, they give to the high mountains of the Empire of Morocco. In that part of the principal chain called Mount Gharian, in the south of Tripoli, several low branches branch off and under the names of Mounts Maray, Black Mount Haroudje, Mount Liberty, Mount Tiggerandoumma and others less known, furrow the great solitudes of the Desert of Lybia and Sahara Proper. From observations made on the spot by Mr. Bruguiere in the former state of Algiers, the great chain which several geographers traced beyond the Little Atlas under the name of Great Atlas does not exist. The inhabitants of Mediah who were questioned on the subject by this traveller, told him positively, that the way from that town to the Sahara was through a ground more or less elevated, and <DW72>s more or less steep, and without having any chain of mountains to cross. The Pass of Teniah which leads from Algiers to Mediah is, therefore, included in the principal chain of that part of the Regency.

A ghostly spot, and full of many ghostly stories besides the legend of Arthur. Here Tregeagle, the great demon of Cornwall, once had his dwelling, until, selling his soul to the devil, his home was sunk to the bottom of the mere, and himself is heard of stormy nights, wailing round it with other ghost-demons, in which the Cornish mind still lingeringly believes. Visionary packs of hounds; a shadowy coach and horses, which drives round and round the pool, and then drives into it; flitting lights, kindled by no human hand, in places where no human foot could go--all these tales are still told by the country folk, and we might have heard them all.
