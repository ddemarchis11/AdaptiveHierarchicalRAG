Then Yuba Bill's voice rose again, apparently in answer to the other. \"Why, that's half a mile away!\" \"Yes, but ye might have dropped onto it in the dark, and it's all on the down grade,\" responded the strange voice more audibly. The passengers were now thoroughly aroused. \"What's up, Ned?\" asked the one at the window of the nearest of two figures that had descended from the box. \"Tree fallen across the road,\" said Ned, the expressman, briefly. \"I don't see no tree,\" responded the passenger, leaning out of the window towards the obscurity ahead. \"Now, that's onfortnit!\" said Yuba Bill grimly; \"but ef any gentleman will only lend him an opery glass, mebbe he can see round the curve and over the other side o' the hill where it is. Now, then,\" addressing the stranger with the lantern, \"bring along your axes, can't ye?\" \"Here's one, Bill,\" said an officious outside passenger, producing the instrument he had taken from its strap in the boot. It was the \"regulation\" axe, beautifully shaped, highly polished, and utterly ineffective, as Bill well knew. \"We ain't cuttin' no kindlin's,\" he said scornfully; then he",

He would have made some tart rejoinder, but was prevented by Yuba Bill addressing the passengers: \"Ye'll have to put up with ONE light, I reckon, until we've got this job finished.\" \"How long will it last, Bill?\" asked the man nearest the window. \"Well,\" said Bill, with a contemptuous glance at the elegant coach axe he was carrying in his hand, \"considerin' these purty first-class highly expensive hash choppers that the kempany furnishes us, I reckon it may take an hour.\" \"But is there no place where we can wait?\" asked the lady anxiously. \"I see a light in that house yonder.\" \"Ye might try it, though the kempany, as a rule, ain't in the habit o' makin' social calls there,\" returned Bill, with a certain grim significance. Then, turning to some outside passengers, he added, \"Now, then! them ez is goin' to help me tackle that tree, trot down!

How far Yuba Bill's irritability and imperious haste contributed to this, or a fear that he might in turn catechise them kept them silent, no one knew. The cynically observant passenger was not there; he and the sole occupant of the box-seat, they were told, had joined the clearing party some moments before, and would be picked up by Yuba Bill later on. Five minutes after Bill had gathered up the reins, they reached the scene of obstruction. The great pine-tree which had fallen from the steep bank above and stretched across the road had been partly lopped of its branches, divided in two lengths, which were now rolled to either side of the track, leaving barely space for the coach to pass. The huge vehicle \"slowed up\" as Yuba Bill skillfully guided his six horses through this narrow alley, whose tassels of pine, glistening with wet, brushed the panels and sides of the coach, and effectually excluded any view from its windows.

But as we're both in a hurry, you'd better look lively about it.\" \"Hand it down,\" said Bill gruffly to the expressman. The expressman turned with a white check but blazing eyes to the compartment below his seat. He lingered, apparently in some difficulty with the lock of the compartment, but finally brought out the box and handed it to another armed and masked figure that appeared mysteriously from the branches beside the wheels. \"Thank you!\" said the voice; \"you can slide on now.\" \"And thank you for nothing,\" said Bill, gathering up his reins. \"It's the first time any of your kind had to throw down a tree to hold me up!\" \"You're lying, Bill!--though you don't know it,\" said the voice cheerfully. \"Far from throwing down a tree to stop you, it was I sent word along the road to warn you from crashing down upon it, and sending you and your load to h-ll before your time! Drive on!\" The angry Bill waited for no second comment, but laying his whip over the backs of his team, drove furiously forward. So rapidly had the whole scene passed that the inside passengers knew nothing of it, and even those on the top of the coach roused from their stupor and inglorious inaction only to cling desperately to the",

When they had disappeared, the young journalist turned to the lady. \"If you would really like to go to that house, I will gladly accompany you.\" It was possible that in addition to his youthful chivalry there was a little youthful resentment of Yuba Bill's domineering prejudices in his attitude. However, the quiet, observant passenger lifted a look of approval to him, and added, in his previous level, half contemptuous tone:-- \"You'll be quite as well there as here, madam, and there is certainly no reason for your stopping in the coach when the driver chooses to leave it.\" The passengers looked at each other. The stranger spoke with authority, and Bill had certainly been a little arbitrary! \"I'll go too,\" said the passenger by the window. \"And you'll come, won't you, Ned?\" he added to the express messenger. The young man hesitated; he was recently appointed, and as yet fresh to the business--but he was not to be taught his duty by an officious stranger!

The address they give him is in one of the many drug-store and cigar-store post-offices which are scattered all over New York, and which contribute to make vice and crime so easy that the evil they do cannot be reckoned in souls lost or dollars stolen. If the letter from the countryman strikes the dealers in green goods as sincere, they appoint an interview with him by mail in rooms they rent for the purpose, and if they, on meeting him there, think he is still in earnest and not a detective or officer in disguise, they appoint still another interview, to be held later in the day in the back room of some saloon. Then the countryman is watched throughout the day from the moment he leaves the first meeting-place until he arrives at the saloon. If anything in his conduct during that time leads the man whose duty it is to follow him, or the \"trailer,\" as the profession call it, to believe he is a detective, he finds when he arrives at the saloon that there is no one to receive him. But if the trailer regards his conduct as unsuspicious, he is taken to another saloon, not the one just appointed, which is, perhaps, a most respectable place, but to the thieves' own private little rendezvous, where he is robbed in any of the several different ways best suited to their purpose. Snipes was a very good trailer. He was so little that no one ever noticed",
