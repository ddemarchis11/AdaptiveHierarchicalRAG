  "question": "In the context of the Anglo-Saxon manuscript housed in the British Museum, what connections can be drawn between the depiction of the harp—rendered from the biblical kinnor that David used to suspend—and ancient musical traditions, particularly those linking biblical and early medieval music?",
  "gold_answer": "The kinnor, which David used to suspend, is rendered as a harp found in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript in the British museum, connecting biblical and early medieval musical traditions.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows that the Anglo-Saxon manuscript in the British Museum depicts King David playing a triangular harp, an image from the early eleventh century. This harp is described as a transitional form between the lyre and the harp, and it is explicitly linked to the biblical kinnor. The manuscript thus visually connects the early medieval Anglo-Saxon harp to the biblical instrument associated with David, suggesting a continuity or transformation of the kinnor into the Anglo-Saxon harp.",

Scarcely better, with regard to acoustics, appears to have been the instrument designated as _nablum_, which we engrave (p. 87) from a manuscript of the ninth century at Angers. [Illustration] A small psalterium with strings placed over a sound-board was apparently the prototype of the _citole_; a kind of dulcimer which was played with the fingers. The names were not only often vaguely applied by the mediæval writers but they changed also in almost every century. The psalterium, or psalterion (Italian _salterio_, English _psaltery_), of the fourteenth century and later had the trapezium shape of the dulcimer. [Illustration] The Anglo-saxons frequently accompanied their vocal effusions with a harp, more or less triangular in shape,--an instrument which may be considered rather as constituting the transition of the lyre into the harp. The representation of king David playing the harp is from an Anglo-saxon manuscript of the beginning of the eleventh century, in the British museum. The harp was especially popular in central and northern Europe, and was the favourite instrument of the German and Celtic bards and of the Scandinavian skalds. In the next illustration from the manuscript of the monastery of St. Blasius twelve strings and two sound holes are given to it. A harp similar in form and size,",

It is, therefore, perhaps not surprising that no material improvement is perceptible in the construction of the instruments of European countries during the lapse of nearly a thousand years. True, evidences to be relied on referring to the first five or six centuries of the Christian era are but scanty; although indications are not wanting which may help the reflecting musician. [Illustration] [Illustration] There are some early monuments of Christian art dating from the fourth century in which the lyre is represented. In one of them Christ is depicted as Apollo touching the lyre. This instrument occurs at an early period in western Europe as used in popular pastimes. In an Anglo-saxon manuscript of the ninth century in the British museum (Cleopatra C. VIII.) are the figures of two gleemen, one playing the lyre and the other a double-pipe. M. de Coussemaker has published in the “Annales Archéologiques” the figure of a crowned personage playing the lyre, which he found in a manuscript of the ninth or tenth century in the library at Angers. The player twangs the strings with his fingers, while the Anglo-saxon gleeman before mentioned uses a plectrum. _Cithara_ was a name applied to several stringed instruments greatly varying in form, power of sound, and compass.

Possibly its name may have been originally _chrotta_ and the continental nations may have adopted it from the Celtic races of the British isles, dropping the guttural sound. This hypothesis is, however, one of those which have been advanced by some musical historians without any satisfactory evidence. [Illustration] [Illustration] We engrave also another representation of David playing on the _rotta_, from a psalter of the seventh century in the British museum (Cott. Vesp. A. I). According to tradition, this psalter is one of the manuscripts which were sent by pope Gregory to St. Augustine. The instrument much resembles the lyre in the hand of the musician (see p. 22) who is supposed to be a Hebrew of the time of Joseph. In the _rotta_ the ancient Asiatic lyre is easily to be recognized. An illumination of king David playing the _rotta_ forms the frontispiece of a manuscript of the eighth century preserved in the cathedral library of Durham; and which is musically interesting inasmuch as it represents a _rotta_ of an oblong square shape like that just noticed and resembling the Welsh _crwth_.

As regards the musical instruments of the Hebrews, we are from biblical records acquainted with the names of many of them; but representations to be trusted are still wanting, and it is chiefly from an examination of the ancient Egyptian and Assyrian instruments that we can conjecture almost to a certainty their construction and capabilities. From various indications, which it would be too circumstantial here to point out, we believe the Hebrews to have possessed the following instruments: THE HARP. There cannot be a doubt that the Hebrews possessed the harp, seeing that it was a common instrument among the Egyptians and Assyrians. But it is uncertain which of the Hebrew names of the stringed instruments occurring in the Bible really designates the harp. THE DULCIMER. Some writers on Hebrew music consider the _nebel_ to have been a kind of dulcimer; others conjecture the same of the _psanterin_ mentioned in the book of Daniel,--a name which appears to be synonymous with the _psalterion_ of the Greeks, and from which also the present oriental dulcimer, _santir_, may have been derived. Some of the instruments mentioned in the book of Daniel may have been synonymous with some which occur in other parts of the Bible under Hebrew names; the names given in Daniel being Chaldæan. The _asor_ was a ten-stringed instrument played with a plectrum, and",
