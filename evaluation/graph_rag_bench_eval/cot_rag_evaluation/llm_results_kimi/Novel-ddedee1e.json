  "question": "In the context of Lower Canadian politics, how did the struggles between French Canadians and the Chateau Clique, along with the direct conflict between the Chateau Clique and the Patriotes, influence the shaping and pursuit of reform within the colony?",
  "gold_answer": "French Canadians struggled with the Chateau Clique, and the Chateau Clique conflicted with the Patriotes, shaping attempts at reform.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows that the French Canadians’ “struggle with the ‘Chateau Clique’” (22-5, 29) and the direct clash between the Patriotes and the Clique (25, 31-2, 54-5) framed the reform agenda: the Ninety-Two Resolutions—drafted by Patriote leaders—were the concrete programme that emerged from this confrontation (38-42, 44-5, 52).",
