  "question": "How does the East River play a significant role in Rags Raegen's actions and reputation, particularly in instances where he interacts with the river during police chases?",
  "gold_answer": "Rags Raegen had plunged in to rescue the supposedly drowned man in the East River and preferred the East River.",
  "llm_answer": "The East River is central to Rags Raegen’s reputation and tactics: it is his chosen refuge when police pursue him.  \nHe races to the waterfront, dives in, and swims underwater back to the landing-steps while officers and onlookers watch the spot where he vanished.  \nOn one occasion he re-enters the crowd, pretends to help search for “the drowned man,” and for four hours directs the river-police as they drag the bottom with grappling irons.  \nThese exploits make the police believe he has drowned and enhance his legend; when they finally block his access to the river, his usual escape route is cut off.",

Indeed, three different men in the precinct, who did not know of young Raegen's aquatic prowess, had returned to the station-house and seriously reported him to the sergeant as lost, and regretted having driven a citizen into the river, where he had been unfortunately drowned. It was even told how, on one occasion, when hotly followed, young Raegen had dived off Wakeman's Slip, at East Thirty-third Street, and had then swum back under water to the landing-steps, while the policeman and a crowd of stevedores stood watching for him to reappear where he had sunk. It is further related that he had then, in a spirit of recklessness, and in the possibility of the policeman's failing to recognize him, pushed his way through the crowd from the rear and plunged in to rescue the supposedly drowned man. And that after two or three futile attempts to find his own corpse, he had climbed up on the dock and told the officer that he had touched the body sticking in the mud. And, as a result of this fiction, the river-police dragged the river-bed around Wakeman's Slip with grappling irons for four hours, while Rags sat on the wharf and directed their movements. But on this present occasion the police were standing between him and the river, and so cut off his escape in that direction, and as they had seen him strike McGonegal",

Then he dashed the bushes aside with both arms, and with a cry that no one but she heard sprang toward her. Young Van Bibber stopped his mail phaeton in front of the club, and went inside to recuperate, and told how he had seen them driving home through the Park in her brougham and unchaperoned. \"Which I call very bad form,\" said the punctilious Van Bibber, \"even though they are engaged.\" MY DISREPUTABLE FRIEND, MR.

Are you her father?\" she asked, sharply. But Rags did not speak, for at the moment she had answered his question and had said the baby would not die, he had reached out swiftly, and taken the child out of her arms and held it hard against his breast, as though he had lost her and some one had been just giving her back to him. His head was bending over hers, and so he did not see Wade and Heffner, the two ward detectives, as they came in from the street, looking hot, and tired, and anxious. They gave a careless glance at the group, and then stopped with a start, and one of them gave a long, low whistle. \"Well,\" exclaimed Wade, with a gasp of surprise and relief. \"So Raegen, you're here, after all, are you? Well, you did give us a chase, you did. Who took you?\" The men of the reserve squad, when they heard the name of the man for whom the whole force had been looking for the past two days, shifted their positions slightly, and looked curiously at Rags, and the woman stopped pouring out the milk from the bottle in her hand, and stared at him in frank astonishment.

The baby ran its arms more closely around Raegen's neck and did not speak, unless its cooing in Raegen's ear was an answer. \"What did you say your name was?\" persisted Raegen, in a whisper. The baby frowned at this and stopped cooing long enough to say: \"Marg'ret,\" mechanically and without apparently associating the name with herself or anything else. \"Margaret, eh!\" said Raegen, with grave consideration. \"It's a very pretty name,\" he added, politely, for he could not shake off the feeling that he was in the presence of a superior being. \"An' what did you say your dad's name was?\" asked Raegen, awkwardly. But this was beyond the baby's patience or knowledge, and she waived the question aside with both arms and began to beat a tattoo gently with her two closed fists on Raegen's chin and throat. \"You're mighty strong now, ain't you?\" mocked the young giant, laughing. \"Perhaps you don't know, Missie,\" he added, gravely, \"that your dad and mar are doing time on the Island, and you won't see 'em again for a month.\" No, the baby did not know this nor care apparently; she seemed content with Rags and with",

The sun rose hissing out of the East River, a broad, red disc of heat. It swept the cross-streets of the city as pitilessly as the search-light of a man-of-war sweeps the ocean. It blazed brazenly into open windows, and changed beds into gridirons on which the sleepers tossed and turned and woke unrefreshed and with throats dry and parched. Its glare awakened Rags into a startled belief that the place about him was on fire, and he stared wildly until the child in his arms brought him back to the knowledge of where he was. He ached in every joint and limb, and his eyes smarted with the dry heat, but the baby concerned him most, for she was breathing with hard, long, irregular gasps, her mouth was open and her absurdly small fists were clenched, and around her closed eyes were deep blue rings. Rags felt a cold rush of fear and uncertainty come over him as he stared about him helplessly for aid. He had seen babies look like this before, in the tenements; they were like this when the young doctors of the Health Board climbed to the roofs to see them, and they were like this, only quiet and still, when the ambulance came clattering up the narrow streets, and bore them away.",

According to the tradition of the Arabs, this place received its name in consequence of a miracle pretended to have been wrought by one of their marabouts, in bringing hither the river of Spaitla, after it was lost underground. For Ja Elma signifies, in their language, 'The water comes!' an expression we are to imagine of surprise at the arrival of the stream.\" During our tour, the mornings were generally cold.

This river comes from the hills about three or four miles off, and when the camp arrives at Kairwan, the Bey sends an order to the Arabs of the district to let the water run down to the place where the tents are pitched. When we arrived, the water had just come. We saw warrens of hares, and caught many with the dogs. Troops of gazelles were also surprised; one was fired at, and went off scampering on three legs.
