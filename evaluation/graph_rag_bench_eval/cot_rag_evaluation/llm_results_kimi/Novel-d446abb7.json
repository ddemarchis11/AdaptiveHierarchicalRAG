  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today I continued my advocacy for Catholic emancipation. I am aware that the Catholics of this era know the necessity of modesty, especially considering their Irish heritage. There is a sentiment in high places that the Irish have been too lenient toward the English, and yet, England itself is a nation with a sense of common descent and unity. My hope is that these reforms will foster greater harmony across all these groups.",

I gathered that our national troubles in the first two decades of this century were not at all due to the mistakes of our administrators; and that England, with its fine Church and Constitution, would have been exceedingly well off if every British subject had been thankful for what was provided, and had minded his own business--if, for example, numerous Catholics of that period had been aware how very modest they ought to be considering they were Irish. The times, I heard, had often been bad; but I was constantly hearing of \"bad times\" as a name for actual evenings and mornings when the godfathers who gave them that name appeared to me remarkably comfortable. Altogether, my father's England seemed to me lovable, laudable, full of good men, and having good rulers, from Mr Pitt on to the Duke of Wellington, until he was for emancipating the Catholics; and it was so far from prosaic to me that I looked into it for a more exciting romance than such as I could find in my own adventures, which consisted mainly in fancied crises calling for the resolute wielding of domestic swords and firearms against unapparent robbers, rioters, and invaders who, it seemed, in my father's prime had more chance of being real.

About the middle of December she had reached Elkhorn, Wisconsin, where she remained a fortnight with Elder Bright, her old pastor. Then she went to her sister Charlotte’s, at Milford. In one of her letters from this place she speaks of going surveying. It seems the surveyor of the neighborhood was surprised to find a woman who understood his business. In the latter part of December, Asaph Hall returned to Goshen, Conn. Hence the following letter: GOSHEN, Jan. 17th, 1856. DEAREST ANGIE: ... I think of you a great deal, Angie, and sometimes when I feel how much better and holier you are than I am, I think that I ought to go through with much trial and affliction before I shall be fitted for your companion. In this way I presume that my letters have been shaded by my occasional sad thoughts. But Angie you _must not_ let them affect you any more, or cherish gloomy thoughts about me.

So, I thought, “Well, I won’t obtrude mine.” Then Mrs. D. said, “You must take a side, you know, and say distinctly what side you are on when you are asked.” So I thought, “Well, I’ll wait till I am asked,” and I have got through to-day without being asked. But, positively, they used the word “boycott” about those D.’s. They have been boycotted by the congregation. It must be rather hard to be a Home Ruler and a Presbyterian just now in Ireland. Positively, they frightened me so, I nearly squirmed under the table. However, when I looked round the congregation I thought I should not mind much being boycotted by them. The sermon was one about forgiving your enemies. Mrs. D. has given me a standing invitation to come to dinner on Sunday. What will happen when I am suddenly asked to take my side, I don’t know.

Graf Solms had such boxes made of tin with the name Jacobi inside. Both Martin and Werner instance the request[8] of a Protestant vicar, Johann David Goll in Trossingen, for a “Lorenzodose” with the promise to subscribe to the oath of the order, and, though Protestant, to name the Catholic Franciscan his brother. According to a spicy review[9] in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[10] these snuff-boxes were sold in Hamburg wrapped in a printed copy of Jacobi’s letter to Gleim, and the reviewer adds, “like Grenough’s tooth-tincture in the directions for its use.”[11] Nicolai in “Sebaldus Nothanker” refers to the Lorenzo cult with evident ridicule.[12] There were other efforts to make Yorick’s example an efficient power of beneficent brotherliness.
