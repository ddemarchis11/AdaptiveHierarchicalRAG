The Minnehahas were a prosperous organization from the first, and their engine house was always kept open and served as a general lounging and reading-room for such of its members as had nothing particular to do. Rotary Independent Company No. 1 was the third engine connected with the St. Paul fire department, but that was a private institution and was only used when there was a general alarm and on the days of the annual parade of the department. This engine was purchased from the government by John S. Prince when Fort Snelling was abandoned, and was used for the protection of the property of the mill, which was located on lower Third street. By the formation of Minnehaha Engine company the city fathers thought they were possessed of quite a respectable fire department, and from that time on the annual parade of the St. Paul fire department was one of the events of the year. The first parade occurred on the 12th of September, 1859, and was participated in by the following organizations:   Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1.",

Mrs. Presley's death was deeply regretted, not only by the fire department, but by every resident of the city. Among the many brilliant members of the legal fraternity in St. Paul in early times no one possessed a more enviable reputation than the Hon. Michael E. Ames. He was the very personification of punctiliousness and always displayed sublime imperturbability in exigencies of great moment. One dreary winter night his sleeping apartment in uppertown was discovered to be on fire, and in a short time the fire laddies appeared in front of his quarters and commenced operations. As soon as Mr. Ames discovered the nature of the disturbance he arose from his bed, opened the window, and with outstretched arms and in a supplicating manner, as if addressing a jury in an important case, exclaimed: \"Gentlemen, if you will be kind enough to desist from operations until I arrange my toilet, I will be down.\" The learned counsel escaped with his toilet properly adjusted, but his apartments were soon incinerated.

From the date of its organization up to the time of the establishment of the paid fire department many of the most prominent men of the city were enrolled among its members. All of the property of the company was owned by the organization, but in 1856, having become somewhat financially embarrassed, their accounts were turned over to the city and they were thereafter under the control of the city fathers. At that time they possessed one truck, hooks and ladders, and one fire engine with hose. Washington M. Stees was made chief engineer and Charles H. Williams assistant. This scanty equipment did not prove adequate for extinguishing fires and petitions were circulated requesting the council to purchase two fire engines of the more approved pattern, and also to construct a number of cisterns in the central part of the city, so that an adequate supply of water could be readily obtained. The city fathers concluded to comply with the request of the petitioners and they accordingly purchased two double-deck hand fire engines and they arrived in the city in August, 1858. They were soon tested and pronounced satisfactory. Our citizens then congratulated themselves upon the possession of a first-class fire department and they predicted that thereafter a great fire would be a thing of the past.
