  "question": "Within the context of Dragon's Blood, how does revealing that Wutzler is a member of the Triad and introducing the White Lotus as a secret band led by Fang the Sword-Pen serve to deepen Wutzler's character and connect him to the larger web of clandestine organizations operating in the story?",
  "gold_answer": "In one chain, Wutzler is revealed to be a member of the Triad, and White Lotus is described as a secret band led by Fang the Sword-Pen, adding complexity to his character and introducing broader organizational elements to the story.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows that Wutzler’s Triad membership and the revelation of the White Lotus led by Fang the Sword-Pen deepen his character by exposing a hidden, conflicted identity and linking him to the story’s covert power struggles. Wutzler’s shame—he “faltered, and hung his head” when admitting, “I am a Heaven-and-Earth man… The Triad!”—reveals he is neither a simple informant nor a passive victim but someone with a fraught allegiance. His insider knowledge of the White Lotus (“They drink blood—plan blood… I know their lodge-room”) places him at the intersection of two clandestine groups: the Triad he belongs to and the White Lotus he fears. This dual connection embeds him within the larger web of secret societies operating behind the riots and trials, showing his actions are driven by personal stakes in these underground rivalries rather than mere happenstance.",

He taught her the verses at home, for safety.--We mean no harm, now, we of the Triad. But there is another secret band, having many of our signs. It is said they ape our ritual. Fang the scholar heads their lodge. They are the White Lotus.\" \"White Lotus?\" Heywood snapped his fingers. \"Nonsense. Extinct, this hundred years.\" \"Extinct? They meet to-night,\" said the outcast, in sudden grief and passion. \"They drink blood--plan blood. Extinct? Are _you_ married to these people? Does the knowledge come so cheap, or at a price? All these years--darkness--sunken--alone\"--He trembled violently, but regained his voice. \"O my friend! This very night they swear in recruits, and set the day. I know their lodge-room. For any sake, believe me! I know!\" \"Right,\" said Heywood, curtly. \"I believe you. But why come here? Why not stay, and learn more?\" Wutzler's head dropped on his breast again. The varnished hat gleamed softly in the darkness. \"I--I dare",

They are coming. We are all marked for massacre. All day I ran about the town, finding out. The trial of Chok Chung, your--_our_ Christian merchant--I saw him 'cross the hall.' They kept asking, 'Do you follow the foreign dogs and goats?' But he would only answer, 'I follow the Lord Jesus.' So then they beat out his teeth with a heavy shoe, and cast him into prison. Now they wait, to see if his padre will interfere with the law. It is a trap. The suit is certainly brought by Fang the scholar, whom they call the Sword-Pen.\" \"That much,\" said Heywood, \"I could have told you.\" Wutzler glanced behind him fearfully, as though the flickering shadows might hear. \"But there is more. Since dark I ran everywhere, watching, listening to gossip. I painted my skin with mangrove-bark water. You know this sign?\" He patted his right leg, where the roll of trousers bound his thigh. \"It is for protection in the streets. It says, 'I am a Heaven-and-Earth man.'\" \"The Triad!\" Heywood whistled. \"You?\" The other faltered,",

At the same instant, from the marsh ahead, the sentinel in the round hat sprang up again, like an instantaneous mushroom. He shouted, and waved to his fellows inland. They had no time, however, to leave the high ground; for the whole chance of the adventure took a sudden and amazing turn. Heywood sprang out of his stupor, and stood pointing. \"Look there!\" he snarled. \"Those--oh!\" He ended with a groan. The face of his friend, by torchlight above the wall, had struck him dumb. Now that he spoke, his companions saw, exposed in the field to the view of the nunnery, a white body lying on a framework as on a bier. Near the foot stood a rough sort of windlass. Above, on the crest of the field, where a band of men had begun to scramble at the sentinel's halloo, there sat on a white pony the bright-robed figure of the tall fanatic, Fang the Sword-Pen. \"He did it!\" Heywood's hands opened and shut rapidly, like things out of control. \"Oh, Wutz, how did they--Saint Somebody--the martyrdom-- Poussin's picture in the Vatican.--I can't stand this, you chaps!\" He snatched blindly at his",

Very clever chap. Of the two most dangerous men in the district, he's one.\" They had swung along briskly for several minutes, before he added: \"The other most dangerous man--you've met him already. If I'm not mistaken, he's no less a person than the Reverend James Earle.\" \"What!\" exclaimed Rudolph, in dull bewilderment. \"Yes,\" grunted his friend. \"The padre. We must find him to-night, and report.\" He strode forward, with no more comment. At his side, Rudolph moved as a soldier, carried onward by pressure and automatic rhythm, moves in the apathy of a forced march. The day had been so real, so wholesome, full of careless talk and of sunlight. And now this senseless picture blotted all else, and remained,--each outline sharper in memory, the smoky lamp brighter, the blow of the hilt louder, the smell of peanut oil more pungent. The episode, to him, was a disconnected, unnecessary fragment, one bloody strand in the whole terrifying snarl.

The reader pointed with his cigar. \"Take only the left half of that word, and what have you?\" \"'Lightning,'\" read Heywood. \"The right half?\" \"'Boat.'\" \"Take,\" the padre ordered, \"this one; left half?\" \"'Lightning,'\" repeated his pupil. \"The right half--might be 'rice-scoop,' But that's nonsense.\" \"No,\" said the padre. \"You have the secret.
