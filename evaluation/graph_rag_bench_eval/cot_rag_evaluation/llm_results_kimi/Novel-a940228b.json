  "question": "Retell the story of Corinna’s farewell to her parrot as if you are Corinna, writing in her personal diary. Include the role of Isis as invoked in the triplets.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today was a day of sorrow. My beloved parrot, companion and confidant, was snatched away by envious fate, taken from my side. I said my farewells with heavy heart. In my grief, I called upon Isis, hoping she would turn her features to me and grant comfort. The gods are distant, yet my pain feels as if I am born to be a cause of trouble to my lover.",
  "llm_answer": "Diary of Corinna\n\nThe seventh dawn rose and with it the thread of your life, my little Indian echo, was measured to its last strand.  I held you against my breast while the fever of the final day burned itself out; your bright wings hung like wilted petals and your voice—once the rival of mine—faltered into a single, breaking cry: “Corinna, farewell!”  The word struck deeper than any human grief, for it was the last gift of a tongue more skilled than any other bird’s.\n\nI have set your small body beneath a stone no larger than yourself, carved with the truth that will outlast marble: “From this very tomb I may be judged to have been the favourite of my mistress.”  Let the passer-by read and know that you were loved beyond measure.\n\nYet I do not leave you to darkness.  I have called upon Isis of the seven-mouthed Nile, she who sits in linen before the altars of Memphis and Canopus, to guide your swift spirit.  By the rattle of her sistrum, by the face of gentle Anubis, by the horned Apis who walks in her train, I have begged her to turn her features toward us—toward you, little speaker, and toward me who remain behind.  Grant, O Queen, that my parrot find the Elysian grove reserved for innocent birds, where swans glide guiltless and the Phoenix lives age after age.  There let him range, welcomed among gentle doves and Juno’s peacocks, attracting the harmless flock with the same words that once delighted me.\n\nLive on in that green shade, my echo; I send you under the protection of Isis, and I keep your memory beneath the protection of my tears.",

And yet your words did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue cried aloud, \"Corinna, farewell!\" [370] At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green. If there is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole bird _of its kind. There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers; the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate. Received in this home in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his words. [372] A sepulchre covers his bones; a sepulchre small as his body; on which a little stone has _this_ inscription, well suited to itself: \"From this very tomb [377] I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress. I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.\" ELEGY VII. _He attempts to convince his mistress,",

THE apples and nuts went round again and again, and for a few minutes nothing was heard save the cracking of shells and the gnawing of sharp white teeth. At length the parrot said, meditatively:-- \"That was a very stupid cow, though! Are all cows as stupid as that?\" \"Well, I don't think they are what you would call brilliant, as a rule,\" Toto admitted; \"but they are generally good, and that is better.\" \"Hem! possibly!\" said Miss Mary, dryly. \"That is probably why we have no cows in Central Africa. Our animals being all, without exception, clever _and_ good, there is really no place for creatures of the sort you describe.\" \"How about the bogghun, Miss Mary?\" asked the raccoon, slyly, with a wink at Toto. The parrot ruffled up her feathers, and was about to make a sharp reply; but suddenly remembering the raccoon's brave defence of her an hour before, she smoothed her plumage again, and replied gently,-- \"I confess that I forgot the bogghun,",
