  "question": "How does the narrative depict the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery, specifically through Blore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver and the process by which Major Tarver is ultimately accepted by Salome?",
  "gold_answer": "Major Tarver is shown being introduced by Blore and ultimately accepted by Salome, illustrating the process by which new individuals are incorporated into the group.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows only that Blore is instructed to “show in Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey,” after which the two officers are greeted by Salome and Sheba.  \nThere is no description of any further process by which Major Tarver is “ultimately accepted” by Salome; the passages supplied end with her still verbally resisting his proposal.",

I beg your pardon--it does nothing of the kind. TARVER. [_Rising with difficulty and approaching SALOME._] Salome--I have loved you distractedly for upwards of eight weeks. SALOME. [_Going to him._] Oh, Major Tarver, let me pass; [_holding his coat firmly_] let me pass, I say. TARVER. Unless you push me, never! SHEBA. Spare me this scene, Mr. Darbey. [_DARBEY follows SHEBA across the room._ TARVER. To a man in my condition love is either a rapid and fatal malady, or it is an admirable digestive. Accept me, and my merry laugh once more rings through the Mess Room. Reject me, and my collection of vocal music, loose and in volumes, will be brought to the hammer, and the bird, as it were, will trill no more. SALOME.

One step further, and I shall ask Major Tarver, who is nearest the bell, to ring for help. [_TARVER sinks into a chair._ DARBEY. [_Standing by the side of TARVER._] There now. The fact is. Miss Jedd, that Tarver is in an exceedingly critical condition. Feeling that he has incurred your displeasure he has failed even in the struggle to gain the race-course. I have taken him to Dr. Middleton and I explained that Major Tarver loved with a passion [_looking at SHEBA_] second only to my own. SALOME.
