  "question": "How did Elsie Maud Inglis leverage both local support, such as sending Miss Burke as a representative, and international resources, including American influence and aid, to support the work of the Scottish Women's Hospitals in Serbia?",
  "gold_answer": "By leveraging local support through colleagues and international aid via American influence, Elsie Inglis mobilized resources for the Scottish Women's Hospitals’ mission in Serbia.",
  "llm_answer": "Local support: Dr Inglis “found” Miss Burke in the London Society office and sent her out to speak and raise money for the Scottish Women’s Hospitals; Burke’s American campaigning then “nobly” filled the S.W-H. treasury.\n\nInternational resources: Burke’s efforts in America secured substantial American aid, and the London Committee of the National Union used its influence to raise funds and equipment for the Serbian unit.",

He is just back from Belgium. He said, “You talk of distress from the war here. You simply know nothing about it.”--Ever yours sincerely, ‘ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’ In October 1914 the scheme was finally adopted by the Scottish Federation, and the name of Scottish Women’s Hospitals was chosen. At the same meeting the committee decided to send Dr. Inglis to London to explain the plan to the National Union, and to speak at a meeting in the Kingsway Hall, on ‘What women could do to help in the war.’ At that meeting she was authorised to speak on the plans of the S.W.H. The N.U.W.S.S. adopted the plan of campaign on 15th October, and the London society was soon taking up the work of procuring money to start new units, and to send Dr. Inglis out on her last enterprise, with a unit fully equipped to work with the Serbian army, then fighting on the Bulgarian front. The use she made of individuals is well illustrated by Miss Burke. She was ‘found’ by Dr. Inglis in the office of the London Society, and sent forth to speak and fill the Treasury chest of the S.W.H.

It was largely due to her intuition and clear judgment of character that my feet were placed in the path which led to my reaching my maximum efficiency as a hospital worker and a member of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals. I first met Dr. Elsie after I had been the Secretary of the London Committee for about a month. There was no question of meeting a “stranger”; her kindly eyes smiled straight into mine. ‘Was I young and rather shy? Well, the best way to encourage me was to give me responsibility. ‘“Do you speak French?” ‘“Yes.” ‘“Very well, go and write me a letter to General de Torcy, telling him we accept the building he has offered at Troyes.” ‘Some one hazarded the suggestion that the letter should be passed on. ‘“Nonsense,” replied Dr. Elsie, “I know the type.

It ran:-- ‘_November 26, 1917._ ‘So sorry I cannot come to London. Dr. Williams and Dr. Ward are agreed, and quite rightly. Will send Gwynn in a day or two with explanations and suggestions. Colonel Miliantinovitch and Colonel Tcholah Antitch were to make appointment this week or next from Winchester; do see them, and also as many of the committee as possible and show them every hospitality. They have been very kind to us, and whatever happens, dear Miss Palliser, do beg the Committee to make sure that they (the Serbs) have their hospitals and transport, for they do need them. ‘Many thanks to the Committee for their kindness to me and their support of me. ‘ELSIE INGLIS. ‘Dictated to Miss Evelyn Simson.’ How the people loved her! was the thought, as she passed through the grief-stricken crowds. These, who knew her best, smiled as they said one to another, ‘How all this would surprise her!’ Edinburgh is a city of spires and of God’s acres, the graves cut in the living rock, within gardens and beside running waters.

Doubtless all the time I was with her I was under her keen scrutiny, and when finally, after arranging a meeting for her at Oxford, which she found impossible to take, owing to her sudden decision to leave for Serbia, she had already judged me, and without hesitation she told me to go to Oxford and speak myself. I have wondered often whether any one else would have sent a young and unknown speaker--it needed Dr. Elsie’s knowledge of human character and rapid energetic method of making decisions. ‘It would be difficult for we young ones of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals to analyse our feelings towards Dr. Elsie. A wave of her hand in passing meant much to us.’ Space utterly forbids our following the fortunes of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals as they went forth one by one to France, to Belgium, to Serbia, to Corsica, and Russia. That history will have some day to be written. It is only possible in this memoir to speak of their work in relation to their founder and leader. ‘Not I, but my unit,’ was her dying watchword, and when the work of her unit is reviewed, it is obvious how they carried with them, as an oriflamme, the inspiration of unselfish devotion set them by Dr.",

She was not confused by any cross-currents of admiration for individual courage and self-sacrifice, and her one desire was to see that the Federation was ‘purged’ of all those who belonged to the forces of disintegration. She had the fruit of her political sagacity, and her fearless pursuit after integrity in deed and in word. When the moment came when she was to go to the battle fronts of the world, a succourer of many, she went in the strength of the Suffrage women of Scotland. They were her shield and buckler, and their loyal support of her work and its ideals was her exceeding great reward. Without their organised strength she could never have called into existence those units and their equipment which have justly earned the praises of nations allied in arms. With the rise of the militant movement, the whole Suffrage cause passed through a cloud of opprobrium and almost universal objurgation. Women were all tarred with the same stick, and fell under one condemnation. It is now of little moment to recall this, except in as much as it affected Elsie Inglis. The Scottish Suffrage societies, who gave their organisation and their workers to start the Scottish Women’s Hospitals, found that the community desired to forget the unpopular Suffrage, and to",
