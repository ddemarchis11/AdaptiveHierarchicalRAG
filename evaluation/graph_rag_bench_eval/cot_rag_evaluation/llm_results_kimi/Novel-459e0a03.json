Certainly. More than fifty pounds. GEORGIANA. No--no, don't be rash! That's the worst of you beginners. Only fifty by to-morrow morning. THE DEAN. Most assuredly. GEORGIANA. Very well then--clap it on to Dandy Dick! THE DEAN. [_With horror._] What! GEORGIANA. He's a certainty--if those two buckets of water haven't put him off it! He's a moral--if he doesn't think of his tail coming down the hill. There's nothing like him at the weight.

To Mr. Clayton's consternation, however, Mr. Pinero announced that he was dissatisfied with his work, and proposed to begin an entirely new play, as he had a more promising idea. But time was pressing, and a successor to \"The Schoolmistress\" was an immediate necessity. However, Mr. Pinero's idea of writing a play round a dean, who, while being a paragon of dignity and decorum, should be driven by an indiscreet act into a most undignified dilemma, appealed to Mr. Clayton, and hastening back to London with the sketches for the requisite scenes, he left Mr. Pinero to set to work at once upon the new scheme. And within a few weeks, indeed by the time the scenery was ready, the new play was completed, the rural constable of a village adjacent to Brighton having suggested the character of Noah Topping. \"Dandy Dick\" was produced at the Court Theatre on January 27th, 1887, and, meeting with a most favorable",
