  "question": "Write a diary entry as the Parrot, describing your life with your mistress, the farewell, and being snatched away, while referencing the trouble caused to her lover.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — My days with my mistress were filled with warmth and chatter. Today, I said farewell to Corinna, her eyes glistening with sorrow. I was snatched away by envy, separated from her gentle hands. I have heard it said that my mistress is born to be a cause of trouble to her lover, and perhaps, even my loss plays a part in the tangled affairs of the heart.",
  "llm_answer": "Diary of the Parrot\n\nDay I know not, for the sun has set on my voice for ever.\n\nI was the pride of her bower, my feathers greener than the emerald, my beak a blush of saffron.  From the moment I was given, I pleased my mistress; I lived to please her.  I mimicked every sound—her laughter, her sighs, the lover’s whispered vows—so prettily that my lisping notes became the music of the house.  A nut, a drop of water, a poppy for sleep: with these I was content, for I had her smiles.\n\nBut my chatter, once a delight, became the scourge of her lover.  When he beat her, I repeated his own cruel words back to him; when he swore fidelity, I piped the names of other women I had heard in the streets.  My beak was quicker than his conscience, and he grew to hate me.  Yet I feared no revenge: I was a lover of peaceful concord, guilty of no wars.\n\nOn the seventh day the North wind carried her prayers across the seas, but Destiny stood spinning her thread.  My tongue, still crying “Corinna, farewell!” faltered only when the dark closed round me.  Snatched away by envious hands—whose I cannot tell—I felt the last flutter of my wings beat against the cage of night.\n\nNow, in the Elysian grove where innocent birds range, I attract the guiltless swans and Juno’s peacock with the memory of my human voice.  My small tomb bears the truth: “From this very tomb I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress.  I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.”  Yet even here I wonder: did my mocking echo hasten the blow that bruised her cheek?  If so, let this stone weigh lighter, for I loved her more than speech.",

All, who poise yourselves in your career in the liquid air; but you, above the rest, affectionate turtle-dove, [360] lament him. Throughout life there was a firm attachment between you, and your prolonged and lasting friendship endured to the end. What the Phocian youth [361] was to the Argive Orestes, the same, parrot, was the turtle-dove to you, so long as it was allowed _by fate._ But what _matters_ that friendship? What the beauty of your rare plumage? What your voice so ingenious at imitating sounds? What avails it that _ever_ since you were given, you pleased my mistress? Unfortunate pride of _all_ birds, you are indeed laid low. With your feathers you could outvie the green emerald, having your purple beak tinted with the ruddy saffron. There was no bird on earth more skilled at imitating sounds; so prettily [362] did you utter words with your lisping notes. Through envy, you were snatched away _from us_: you were the cause of no cruel wars; you were a chatterer, and the lover of peaceful concord.

And yet your words did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue cried aloud, \"Corinna, farewell!\" [370] At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green. If there is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole bird _of its kind. There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers; the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate. Received in this home in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his words. [372] A sepulchre covers his bones; a sepulchre small as his body; on which a little stone has _this_ inscription, well suited to itself: \"From this very tomb [377] I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress.

She has replied that it is quite impossible, as the eunuch Bagous is set to watch her.
