  "gold_answer": "Local rulers such as the Emperor and Sultan govern regions, but their domains have experienced foreign actions like the English occupation of Tangier, French bombardment of Mogador, and Portuguese destruction of Anfa, showing both internal authority and external challenges.",
  "llm_answer": "The triplets illustrate the fragile interplay between local rulers and foreign powers by showing how external assaults expose the internal collapse of Moroccan authority. In each episode the nominal sovereign—the Emperor at Mequinez or the Sultan in Salee—proves unable to protect his own subjects or even the foreign consuls nominally under his safeguard.\n\n1. England’s earlier occupation of Tangier is recalled as a time when France encouraged the Moors to harass the English garrison, revealing how European rivals manipulated local rulers for their own ends while the Sultan could do little more than acquiesce.\n\n2. During the French bombardment of Mogador the Governor and his troops “disgracefully and precipitately fled,” abandoning the city to plunder by “wild tribes” who had been levied to defend it. The Emperor’s representative, Deputy-Governor Sidi Abdallah Deleero, refused to let British and other Europeans leave, cynically declaring “Let the Christians share the same fate and dangers as ourselves,” thereby converting foreign residents into human shields. The city’s Jews, the Emperor’s own protected merchants, were massacred or stripped by these same tribal militias while the imperial authority evaporated.\n\n3. The Portuguese destruction of Anfa (mentioned only as a past precedent of foreign violence) is implicitly paralleled: once an external force strikes, the Sultan’s control vanishes and the population is left to the mercy of ungoverned tribes.\n\nThus the triplets—English Tangier, French-bombarded Mogador, and the memory of Portuguese-razed Anfa—form a single pattern: foreign intervention instantly exposes the hollowness of the Emperor’s or Sultan’s internal governance, as their officials flee, their garrisons collapse, and their subjects are delivered over to lawlessness.",

Hearing that the Jews of Tangier, on returning from Gibraltar, would often adopt the European dress, and so, by disguising themselves, be treated like Christians and Europeans, he ordered all these would-be Europeans forthwith to be undressed, and to resume their black turban. Alas, how were all these Passover, Tabernacle and wedding festivals, these happy and joyous days of the Jewish society of Mogador, changed on the bombardment of that city! What became of the rich and powerful merchants, the imperial vassals of commerce with their gorgeous wives bending under the weight of diamonds, pearls, and precious gems, during that sad and unexpected period? The newspapers of the day recorded the melancholy story. Many of the Jews were massacred, or buried underneath the ruins of the city; their wives subjected to plunder; the rest were left wandering naked and starving on the desolate sandy coast of the Atlantic, or hidden in the mountains, obtaining a momentary respite from the rapacious fury of the savage Berbers and Arabs. It is well known that, while the French bombarded Tangier and Mogador from without, the Berber and Arab tribes, aided by the _canaille_ of the Moors, plundered the city from within.

The batteries were silenced, and the Moorish authorities with many of the inhabitants fled, leaving the city unprotected against the wild tribes, who this evening and the next morning, sacked and fired the city. On the 16th, nine hundred French were landed on the isle of Mogador. After a rude encounter with the garrison, they took possession of it and its forts. Their loss was, after twenty-eight hours' bombarding, trifling, some twenty killed and as many more wounded; the Moors lost some five hundred on the isle killed, besides the casualties in the city. The British Consul and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, with others, were obliged to remain in the town during the bombardment on account of their liabilities to the Emperor.

We have for any complaint, substituted serious personal injury, and I cannot but observe that the making of the Emperor the final judge, in such case, is a stretch of too great confidence in Moorish justice. Not that a Sultan of Morocco is necessarily bad or worse than an European Sovereign, but because a personage of such power and character, armed with unbounded attributes of despotism over his own subjects, who are considered his Abeed, or slaves, whilst feebly aided by the perception of the common rights of men, and imperfectly acquainted with European civilization, can never, unless, indeed by accident or miracle, justly decide upon the case of an Englishman, or upon a dispute between his own and a foreign subject; for",

As in many other parts of the Mediterranean, France and England have incessantly contended for influence at the Court of Morocco. Various irregular missions to this Court have been undertaken by European powers, from the first establishment of the Moorish empire of the West. The French entered regularly into relations with the western Moors shortly after us; their flag, indeed, began to appear at their ports in 1555, under Francis I. They succeeded in gaining the favour of the Moors whilst we occupied Tangier, and Louis XIV. encouraged them in their efforts to attack or harass our garrison. The nature of our struggles with the Moors of Morocco can be at once conjectured from the titles of the pamphlets published in those times, viz. \"_Great_ and _bloody_ news of Tangier,\" (London 1680), and \"The Moors _blasted_, being a discourse concerning Tangier, especially when it was under the Earl of Teviot,\" (London, 1681). But, after the peace of Utrecht, conceding Gibraltar to England, and which more than compensated us for the loss of Tangier, the influence of France in Morocco began to wane, and the trade of this empire was absorbed by the British during the 18th century.
