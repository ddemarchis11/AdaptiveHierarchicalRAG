It will make you feel exactly as if you were dead and buried.\" That not being the prominent object of our tour in Cornwall, we thanked him again, but as soon as he left the carriage determined among ourselves to take no further steps about visiting Gerrans. [Illustration: VIEW OF FLUSHING FROM THE GREEN BANK HOTEL, FALMOUTH.] However, in spite of the urgency of another fellow-traveller--it is always good to hear everybody's advice, and follow your own--we carried our love of quietness so far that we eschewed the magnificent new Falmouth Hotel, with its _table d'hote_, lawn tennis ground, sea baths and promenade, for the old-fashioned Green Bank, which though it had no green banks, boasted, we had been told, a pleasant little sea view and bay view, and was a resting-place full of comfort and homely peace. Which we found true, and would have liked to stay longer in its pleasant shelter, which almost conquered our horror of hotels; but we had now fairly weighed anchor and must sail on. \"You ought to go at once to the Lizard,\" said the friend who met us, and did everything for us at Falmouth--and the remembrance of whom, and of all that happened in our brief stay, will make the very name of the place sound sweet in our ears",

The building had just been finished and furnished for occupancy. A strong wind was raging and the little band of firemen were unable to save the structure. The names of Rev. D.D. Neill, Isaac Markley, Bartlett Presley and W.M. Stees were among the firemen who assisted in saving the furniture. The Sintominie hotel on the corner of Sixth and John streets, was the second hotel to receive a visit from the fire king. This hotel was constructed by the late C.W. Borup, and it was the pride of lower town. Howard Ward and E.C. Rich were preparing to open it when the fire occurred. Owing to the lack of fire protection the building was totally destroyed. Early in the winter of 1856 the Rice house, commonly supposed to be the first brick building erected in St. Paul, was burned to the ground. It was three stories high, and when in process of building was considered a visionary enterprise. The building was constructed by Henry M. Rice, and he spared no expense to make it as complete as the times would allow. It was situated on Third street near Market, and in the early days was considered St. Paul's principal hotel. In its parlor and barroom the second session of the territorial legislature was held, and the supreme court of the",

Not many years had passed since Fort Stanwix resounded with the warwhoops of St. Leger’s Indians. Indeed, Huldah Cook herself—she was Huldah Pratt then, a little girl of ten years—had been in Albany when Burgoyne surrendered. No doubt as the emigrants entered the Mohawk Valley, little Electa Cook heard from her mother’s lips something about Arnold and Morgan and their victorious soldiers. Perhaps she saw in imagination what her mother had actually seen—soldiers in three-cornered hats, some in uniform and some in plain homespun, every man armed with powder horn and musket, hurrying through the streets of the quaint old town to the American camp beyond. Perhaps she saw the fiery Arnold himself, mounted on his fiery warhorse. Perhaps she saw Daniel Morgan and his men—of all the heroes of the Revolution none was braver and truer than he, and of all the soldiers in Washington’s army none could shoot straighter than the men that magnanimous general sent to Gates—Morgan’s riflemen. Moses Stickney was a crack shot, too. I have seen a long-barreled musket of fine workmanship which he carried in the Revolution, and have listened to tales of his marksmanship still preserved in the Vermont valley whither his sons treked westward",
