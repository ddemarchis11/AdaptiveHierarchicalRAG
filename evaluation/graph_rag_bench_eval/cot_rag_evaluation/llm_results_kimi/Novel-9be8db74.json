  "gold_answer": "The names of Egypt, Tyre, and Khati have etymology in the Maya language.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative claims that the names of Egypt, Tyre, and the Khati (Hittites) derive from Maya roots and gives these specific examples:\n\n- Egypt: the biblical name Mizraim is said to come from the Maya verbs MIZ (“to clean, remove rubbish formed by dead trees”) and MUSUR (“to cut trees by the roots”), while the Egyptian name for the Nile, Hapimu, is explained as HA (“water”) + PIMIL (“thickness of flat things”), i.e. “the abyss of water.” Thebes is called NO/NA-AMUN, and NA in Maya means “house, mansion.”\n\n- Tyre: the Phoenician name Tzur is linked to Maya TZUC, “promontory” or “a number of villages.”\n\n- Khati (Hittites): their self-designation is derived from Maya KAT/KATAH, “to place impediments on the road,” reflecting their role as obstructers of Egyptian expansion. Their cities are likewise given Maya etymologies: Carchemish is decoded as CAH (“city”) + CHEMUL (“navigator/merchant”), hence “city of merchants,” and Katish as CAH (“city”) + TICH (a Maya sacrificial ceremony), hence “city where sacrifices are offered.”",

Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more I could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas and the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned men of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of their ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had emigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the Chinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the rising sun, establish themselves in America. In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of CAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests in the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its details. It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their sister ISIS. Some of the names only have been changed when the members of the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching apotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped.

They formed a great nation that inhabited the _Caele-Syria_ and the valley of the Orontes, where they have left very interesting proofs of their passage on earth, in large and populous cities whose ruins have been lately discovered. Their origin is unknown, and is yet a problem to be solved. They are celebrated on account of their wars against the Assyrians and Egyptians, who call them the plague of Khati. Their name is frequently mentioned in the Scriptures as Hittites. Placed on the road, between the Assyrians and the Egyptians, by whom they were at last vanquished, they placed well nigh insuperable _obstacles in the way_ of the conquests of these two powerful nations, which found in them tenacious and fearful adversaries. The Khati had not only made considerable improvements in all military arts, but were also great and famed merchants; their emporium _Carchemish_ had no less importance than Tyre or Carthage. There, met merchants from all parts of the world; who brought thither the products and manufactures of their respective countries, and were wont to worship at the Sacred City, _Katish_ of the Khati.

Before leaving Asia Minor, in order to seek in Egypt the vestiges of the Mayas, I will mention the fact that the names of some of the natives who inhabited of old that part of the Asiatic continent, and many of those of places and cities seem to be of American Maya origin. The Promised Land, for example--that part of the coast of Phoenicia so famous for the fertility of its soil, where the Hebrews, after journeying during forty years in the desert, arrived at last, tired and exhausted from so many hard-fought battles--was known as _Canaan_. This is a Maya word that means to be tired, to be fatigued; and, if it is spelled _Kanaan_, it then signifies abundance; both significations applying well to the country. TYRE, the great emporium of the Phoenicians, called _Tzur_, probably on account of being built on a rock, may also derive its name from the Maya TZUC, a promontory, or a number of villages, _Tzucub_ being a province.

Some historians having pretended that they were a Scythian tribe, derived it from Scythia; but I think that we may find it very natural, as that of their principal cities, in the Maya language. All admit that the Khati, until the time when they were vanquished by Rameses the Great, as recorded on the walls of his palace at Thebes, the _Memnonium_, always placed obstacles on the way of the Egyptians and opposed them. According to the Maya, their name is significative of these facts, since KAT or KATAH is a verb that means to place impediments on the road, to come forth and obstruct the passage. _Carchemish_ was their great emporium, where merchants from afar congregated; it was consequently a city of merchants. CAH means a city, and _Chemul_ is navigator. _Carchemish_ would then be _cah-chemul_, the city of navigators, of merchants. KATISH, their sacred city, would be the city where sacrifices are offered.

Now we have the Maya verb MIZ--to _clean_, to _remove rubbish formed by the body of dead trees_; whilst the verb MUSUR means to _cut the trees by the roots_. It would seem that the name _Mizraim_ given to Egypt in the Scriptures also might come from these words. When the Western invaders reached the country it was probably covered by the waters of the river, to which, we are told, they gave the name of _Hapimu_. Its etymology seems to be yet undecided by the Egyptologists, who agree, however, that its meaning is the _abyss of water_. The Maya tells us that this name is composed of two words--HA, water, and PIMIL, the thickness of flat things. _Hapimu_, or HAPIMIL, would then be the thickness, the _abyss of water_. We find that the prophets _Jeremiah_ (xlvi., 25,) and _Nahum_ (iii., 8, 10,) call THEBES, the capital of upper Egypt during the XVIII. dynasty: NO or NA-AMUN, the mansion of Amun. _Na_ signifies in Maya, house, mansion, residence.
