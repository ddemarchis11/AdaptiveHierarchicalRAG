  "question": "In what way did the storm affect the journey of the coach along the mountain road, considering the storm's fury spent on the mountain and the incident where the coach ran upon the pole-straps of the arrested horses?",
  "gold_answer": "The storm spent its fury on the mountain, and the coach ran upon the pole-straps.",
  "llm_answer": "The storm’s fury, spent high on the mountain, had already abated by the time the coach reached the level terrace below; the vehicle’s sudden jolt came from running upon the taut pole-straps of the now-arrested horses, not from any continuing violence of wind or snow.",

BILSON'S HOUSEKEEPER FROM SAND HILL TO PINE A NIECE OF SNAPSHOT HARRY'S I There was a slight jarring though the whole frame of the coach, a grinding and hissing from the brakes, and then a sudden jolt as the vehicle ran upon and recoiled from the taut pole-straps of the now arrested horses. The murmur of a voice in the road was heard, followed by the impatient accents of Yuba Bill, the driver. \"Wha-a-t? Speak up, can't ye?\" Here the voice uttered something in a louder key, but equally unintelligible to the now interested and fully awakened passengers. One of them dropped the window nearest him and looked out. He could see the faint glistening of a rain-washed lantern near the wheelers' heads, mingling with the stronger coach lights, and the glow of a distant open cabin door through the leaves and branches of the roadside. The sound of falling rain on the roof, a soft swaying of wind-tossed trees, and an impatient movement on the box-seat were all they heard. Then",

But he was young, and there was the thrill of adventure in this. \"I will go,\" he said quietly. \"We thought you would. You must take the up stage to-night. Come again and get your final instructions. By the way, you might get some information at Trixit's house. You--er--er--are acquainted with his daughter, I think?\" \"Which makes it quite impossible for me to seek her for such a purpose,\" said Masterton coldly. A few hours later he was on the coach. As they cleared the outskirts of the town, they passed two Chinamen plodding sturdily along in the dust of the highway. Mr. Masterton started from a slight doze in the heavy, lumbering \"mountain wagon\" which had taken the place of the smart Concord coach that he had left at the last station. The scenery, too, had changed; the four horses threaded their way through rocky defiles of stunted larches and hardy \"brush,\" with here and there open patches of shrunken snow. Yet at the edge of declivities he could still see through the rolled-up leather curtains the valley below bathed in autumn, the glistening rivers half spent with the long summer drought, and the green <DW72>s rolling upward into crest",

But presently, to Masterton's great relief, the interminable level seemed to end, and between the whitened blasts he could see that the road was descending. Again the horses were urged forward, and at last he could feel that the vehicle began to add the momentum of its descent to its conflict with the storm. The blasts grew less violent, or became only the natural resistance of the air to their dominant rush. With the cessation of the snow volleys and the clearing of the atmosphere, the road became more strongly defined as it plunged downward to a terrace on the mountain flank, several hundred feet below. Presently they came again upon a thicker growth of bushes, and here and there a solitary fir. The wind died away; the cold seemed to be less bitter. Masterton, in his relief, glanced smilingly at his companions on the box, but the driver's mouth was compressed as he urged his team forward, and the other passenger looked hardly less anxious. They were now upon the level terrace, and the storm apparently spending its fury high up and behind them. But in spite of the clearing of the air, he could not but notice that it was singularly dark. What was more singular, the darkness seemed to have",

Seen from the coach top, the horses appeared to be cleaving their way through a dark, shining olive sea, that parted before and closed behind them, as they slowly passed. The leaders were just emerging from it, and Bill was gathering up his slackened reins, when a peremptory voice called, \"Halt!\" At the same moment the coach lights flashed upon a masked and motionless horseman in the road. Bill made an impulsive reach for his whip, but in the same instant checked himself, reined in his horses with a suppressed oath, and sat perfectly rigid. Not so the expressman, who caught up his rifle, but it was arrested by Bill's arm, and his voice in his ear! \"Too late!--we're covered!--don't be a d----d fool!\" The inside passengers, still encompassed by obscurity, knew only that the stage had stopped. The \"outsiders\" knew, by experience, that they were covered by unseen guns in the wayside branches, and scarcely moved. \"I didn't think it was the square thing to stop you, Bill, till you'd got through your work,\" said a masterful but not unpleasant voice, \"and if you'll just hand down the express box, I'll pass you and the rest of your load through free.
