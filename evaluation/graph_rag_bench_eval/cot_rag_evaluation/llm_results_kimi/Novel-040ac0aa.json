  "question": "How do the actions of the Green Man, such as meeting Eileen Macarthy, granting Eily a wish, asking questions of Eily, and receiving answers from Eily, overlap or differ in his interactions with both Eily and Eileen Macarthy within the story?",
  "gold_answer": "The Green Man meets Eileen Macarthy, gives Eily a wish, asks Eily questions, and receives answers from Eily, showing his interactions with both Eily and Eileen Macarthy.",
  "llm_answer": "Overlap  \n- The Green Man addresses the same person—Eileen Macarthy—using both her full name and her home nickname “Eily,” so the questioning, the wish-making, and the granting all occur within one continuous conversation with a single child.  \n- He asks for her name, she gives it as “Eileen Macarthy” and adds “They calls me Eily,” and he immediately uses “Eily” when he questions her and when he grants the wish.  \n\nDifference  \n- There is no separate encounter with anyone else: every action—meeting, asking, answering, wish-making, wish-granting—belongs to the one scene between the Green Man and Eileen Macarthy/Eily.",

Never believe a word he says! And now, Eily, alanna, I'm going to do ye a fairy's turn before I go. Ye shall have yer wish of whatever ye like in the world. Take a minute to think about it, and then make up yer mind.\" Eily fairly gasped for breath. Her dreams had then come true; she was to have a fairy wish! Could it possibly be true?",
