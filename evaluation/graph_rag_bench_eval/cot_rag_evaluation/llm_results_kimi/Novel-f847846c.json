  "question": "Imagine you are Young Simon. Write a diary entry about your family connections and your feelings about the events involving your cousin Cæsar and Roxie.",
  "gold_answer": "As the only son of S. S. Simon, I often hear stories about our family. My cousin, Cæsar, has been at the center of recent events, from delivering a note to the Governor to helping Simon learn about Roxie's family. I hear Roxie has been charged, and I worry for her. Our family feels so interconnected, especially with big-sis raising Cæsar and our ties to the Carlow and Brindle families.",
  "llm_answer": "**Diary Entry – Young Simon**  \n*April 6, 1861 – Chicago*  \n\nI am weak, but I must set this down.  \n\nCousin Cæsar has told me everything.  My uncle’s estate—my own inheritance—was never truly mine alone.  Twenty thousand dollars, twenty years of interest, and a tangle of claims stretch from Arkansas to Kentucky.  Roxie, whose laughter I hear in the next room, is one of the heirs.  She does not know the sum, only that “poor trash” may yet have a stake.  I love her for her honesty; she asked no boast of my blood, only listened while I turned the talk, afraid to speak the figure twenty.  \n\nWe are to wed in the spring.  I signed the will this afternoon, every acre, bale, and dollar to Roxie Daymon.  Governor Morock took ten dollars for his trouble; she slipped the note to Cæsar herself.  My cousin’s eyes were wide when he read the papers at dawn—”whole estate… more than a million… to Roxie Daymon.”  He is bewildered, but he will carry out my wish: lay me beside Father on the home plantation.  \n\nI have lived on excitement; now I live on the thought of her.  If the image of Roxie is the last light I see, it is enough.",

Cousin Cæsar now told young Simon the whole story. Twenty-thousand dollars, with twenty years interest, was against his estate. Roxie Daymon, the young lady on the boat, was an heir, others lived in Kentucky--all of which cousin Cæsar learned from a descendant of Brindle Bill. The pleasure party with Simon and cousin Cæsar, stopped at the same hotel in the Crescent City. At the end of three weeks the pleasure party returned to Chicago.

Young Simon and cousin Cæsar left for the West Indies.--Young Simon and Roxie Daymon were engaged to be married the following spring at Chicago. Simon saw many beautiful women in his travels--but the image of Roxie Daymon was ever before him. The good Angel of observation has failed to inform us, of Roxie Daymon's feelings and object in the match. A young and beautiful woman; full of life and vigor consenting to wed a dying man, _hushed_ the voice of the good Angel, and he has said nothing. Spring with its softening breezes returned--the ever to be remembered spring of 1861. The shrill note of the iron horse announced the arrival of young Simon and cousin Cæsar in Chicago, on the 7th day of April, 1861. Simon had lived upon excitement, and reaching the destination of his hopes--the great source of his life failed--cousin Cæsar carried him into the hotel--he never stood alone again--the marriage was put off--until Simon should be better. On the second day, cousin Cæsar was preparing to leave the room, on business in a distant part of the city. Roxie had been several times alone with Simon, and was then present. Roxie handed a sealed note to cousin Cæsar, politely asking him to deliver it. The note was inscribed, Gov. Morock, No.",

Cousin Cæsar had been absent but a short time, when that limb of the law appeared and wrote a will dictated by young Simon; bequeathing all of his possessions, without reserve to Roxie Daymon. “How much,” said Roxie, as the Governor was about to leave. “Only ten dollars, madam,” said the Governor, as he stuffed the bill carelessly in his vest pocket and departed. Through the long vigils of the night cousin Cæsar sat by the side of the dying man; before the sun had silvered the eastern horizon, the soul of young Simon was with his fathers. The day was consumed in making preparations for the last, honor due the dead. Cousin Cæsar arranged with a party to take the remains to Arkansas, and place the son by the side of the father, on the home plantation. The next morning as cousin Cæsar was scanning the morning papers, the following brief notice attracted his attention: “Young Simon, the wealthy young cotton planter, who died in the city yesterday, left by his last will and testament his whole estate, worth more than a million of dollars, to Roxie Daymon, a young lady of this city.” Cousin Cæsar was bewildered and astonished.

My father's name was Cæsar Simon, and I bear his name. My mother's name was Nancy Wade. I do not remember either of them I was partly raised by my sisters, and the balance of the time I have tried to raise myself, but it seems it will take me a Iong time to _make a raise_--” at this point, Brindle interfered in breathless suspense, with the inquiry, “Did you have an uncle named S. S. Simon?” “I have heard my sister say as much,” continued Simon. “Then your dream is interpreted,” said Brindle, emphatically. “Your Uncle, S. S. Simon, has left one of the largest estates in Arkansas, and now you are on the steam wagon again,” said Brindle, slapping his companion on the shoulder. Brindle had been instructed by his mother, and made Cousin Cæsar acquainted with the outline of all the history detailed in this narrative, except the history of Roxie Daymon _alias_ Roxie Fairfield, in Chicago. The next day the two men were hired as hands to go down the river on a flat-bottom boat. Roxie Daymon, whose death has been recorded, left an only daughter, now grown to womanhood, and bearing her",

We see Cousin Cæsar and Cliff Carlo in close counsel, upon the subject of meeting the expenses of the contest at law over the Simon estate, in the State of Arkansas. Cliff Carlo was rather non-committal. Roxie Daymon was a near relative, and the unsolved problem in the case of compromise and law did not admit of haste on the part of the Carlo family. Compromise was not the forte of Cousin Cæsar, To use his own words, “I have made the cast, and will stand the hazard of the die.” But the enterprise, with surrounding circumstances, would have baffled a bolder man than Cæsar Simon.
