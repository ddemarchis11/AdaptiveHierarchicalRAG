  "question": "Throughout Dragon's Blood, what does the recurring portrayal of Rudolph trembling in the presence of Heywood suggest about the nature of their interpersonal dynamic, and how does this reaction inform the reader about power relations or emotional tension between these two characters in various narrative situations?",
  "gold_answer": "Rudolph’s consistent trembling in Heywood’s presence suggests a persistent power imbalance or sense of intimidation, which frames the subsequent events across all chains.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence provided does not contain any instance of Rudolph trembling in Heywood’s presence, so it is insufficient to answer the question about what such trembling suggests or how it informs the reader about power relations or emotional tension between the two characters.",

I've made a wonderful plan--with the captain's fortune! Dear old Kneebone.\" A small white heap across the deck began to rise. \"How often,\" complained a voice blurred with sleep, \"how often must I tell ye--wake me, unless the ship--chart's all--Good God!\" At the captain's cry, those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof began to mutter, to rise, and grope out into the trembling light, with sleepy cries of joy.

Heywood, now lazy, now animated, exchanged barbaric words with the boat-woman. As their tones rose and fell, she laughed. Long afterward, Rudolph was to remember her, a wholesome, capable figure in faded blue, darting keen glances from her beady eyes, flashing her white teeth in a smile, or laughing till the green pendants of false jade trembled in her ears. \"Her name is Mrs. Wu,\" said Heywood, between smoke-rings, \"and she is a lady of humor. We are discussing the latest lawsuit, which she describes as suing a flea and winning the bite. Her maiden name was the Pretty Lily. She is captain of this sampan, and fears that her husband does not rate A. B.\" Where the river disembogued, the Pretty Lily, cursing and shrilling, pattering barefoot about her craft, set a matting sail and caught the breeze. Over the copper surface of the roadstead, the sampan drew out handily. Ahead, a black, disreputable little steamer lay anchored, her name--two enormous hieroglyphics painted amidships--staring a bilious yellow in the morning sun. Under these, at last, the sampan came bumping,",

But what he attempts is not a continuation but a German parallel. In the outward events of his story, in the general trend of its argument, Schummel does not depend upon either Shandy or the Journey: the hero’s circumstances are in general not traceable to the English model, but, spasmodically, the manner of narration and the nature of the incidents are quite slavishly copied. A complete summary of the thread of incident on which the various sentimental adventures, whimsical speculations and digressions are hung, can be dispensed with: it is only necessary to note instances where connection with Sterne as a model can be established. Schummel’s narrative is often for many successive pages absolutely straightforward and simple, unbroken by any attempt at Shandean buoyancy, and unblemished by overwrought sentiment. At the pausing places he generally indulges in Sternesque quibbling. A brief analysis of the first volume, with especial reference to the appropriation of Yorick features, will serve to show the extent of imitation, and the nature of the method. In outward form the Sentimental Journey is copied. The volume is not divided into chapters, but there are named",

Never did Heywood's fat water-jar glisten more welcome than when he gained the vaulted bath-room. He ripped off his blood-stained clothes, scrubbed the sacrificial clots from his hair, and splashed the cool water luxuriously over his exhausted body. When at last he had thrown a kimono about him, and wearily climbed the stairs, he was surprised to see Rudolph, in the white-washed room ahead, pacing the floor and ardently twisting his little moustache. As Heywood entered, he wheeled, stared long and solemnly. \"I must wait to tell you.\" He stalked forward, and with his sound left hand grasped Heywood's right. \"This afternoon, you--\" \"My dear boy, it's too hot. No speeches.\" But Rudolph's emotion would not be hindered. \"This afternoon,\" he persisted, with tragic voice and eyes, \"this afternoon I nearly was killed.\" \"So was I.--Which seems to meet that.\" And Heywood pulled free. \"Oh,\" cried Rudolph, fervently. \"I know!
