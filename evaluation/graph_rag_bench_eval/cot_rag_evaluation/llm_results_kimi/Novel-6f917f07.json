Then they turned and looked at each other with anxious inquiry and with much concern, for they recognized for the first time that their voices had been loud. The older man stepped quickly across the floor, but before he reached the middle of the room the door opened from the outside, and his daughter stood in the door-way, with her head held down and her eyes looking at the floor. \"Ellen!\" exclaimed the father, in a voice of pain and the deepest pity. The girl moved toward the place from where his voice came, without raising her eyes, and when she reached him put her arms about him and hid her face on his shoulder. She moved as though she were tired, as though she were exhausted by some heavy work. \"My child,\" said the bishop, gently, \"were you listening?\" There was no reproach in his voice; it was simply full of pity and concern. \"I thought,\" whispered the girl, brokenly, \"that he would be frightened; I wanted to hear what he would say. I thought I could laugh at him for it afterward. I did it for a joke. I thought--\" she stopped with a little gasping sob that she tried to hide, and for a moment held herself erect and then sank back again into her father's arms with her head upon his breast. Latimer started forward, holding out his arms to her. \"Ellen,\" he said,",

Can I risk that?\" \"But I tell you it is impossible,\" cried the young man. \"The woman is beyond the love of any man, at least such a man as I am, or try to be.\" \"Do you mean,\" asked the bishop, gently, and with an eager look of hope, \"that she is dead?\" Latimer faced the father for some seconds in silence. Then he raised his head slowly. \"No,\" he said, \"I do not mean she is dead. No, she is not dead.\" Again the bishop moved back wearily into his chair. \"You mean then,\" he said, \"perhaps, that she is a married woman?\" Latimer pressed his lips together at first as though he would not answer, and then raised his eyes coldly. \"Perhaps,\" he said. The older man had held up his hand as if to signify that what he was about to say should be listened to without interruption, when a sharp turning of the lock of the door caused both father and the suitor to start.

He drew back from the girl in his arms and looked anxiously and feelingly at her lover. \"How could you, Ellen,\" he said, \"how could you?\" He was watching the young man's face with eyes full of sympathy and concern. \"How little you know him,\" he said, \"how little you understand. He will not do that,\" he added quickly, but looking questioningly at Latimer and speaking in a tone almost of command. \"He will not undo all that he has done; I know him better than that.\" But Latimer made no answer, and for a moment the two men stood watching each other and questioning each other with their eyes. Then Latimer turned, and without again so much as glancing at the girl walked steadily to the door and left the room. He passed on slowly down the stairs and out into the night, and paused upon the top of the steps leading to the street. Below him lay the avenue with its double line of lights stretching off in two long perspectives. The lamps of hundreds of cabs and carriages flashed as they advanced toward him and shone for a moment at the turnings of the cross-streets, and from either",

Ask him to go away.\" Latimer stopped and took a step back as though some one had struck him, and then stood silent with his face flushed and his eyes flashing. It was not in answer to anything that they said that he spoke, but to their attitude and what it suggested. \"You stand there,\" he began, \"you two stand there as though I were something unclean, as though I had committed some crime. You look at me as though I were on trial for murder or worse. Both of you together against me. What have I done? What difference is there? You loved me a half-hour ago, Ellen; you said you did. I know you loved me; and you, sir,\" he added, more quietly, \"treated me like a friend. Has anything come since then to change me or you? Be fair to me, be sensible. What is the use of this?

Imagine that I had the power to tell you, or rather that some superhuman agent could convince you, that you had but a month to live, and that for what you did in that month you would not be held responsible either by any moral law or any law made by man, and that your life hereafter would not be influenced by your conduct in that month, would you spend it, I ask you--and on your answer depends mine--would you spend those thirty days, with death at the end, with my daughter, or with some other woman of whom I know nothing?\" Latimer sat for some time silent, until indeed, his silence assumed such a significance that he raised his head impatiently and said with a motion of the hand, \"I mean to answer you in a minute; I want to be sure that I understand.\" The bishop bowed his head in assent, and for a still longer period the",
