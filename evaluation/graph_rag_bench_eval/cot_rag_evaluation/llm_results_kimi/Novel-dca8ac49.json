  "gold_answer": "Launce’s Diary: The day was peaceful until a boat, with John Curgenven aboard, entered our cave. The water stirred as the boat’s shadow passed over us. The other fishes, always chasing me, seemed distracted by the newcomers. I kept close to the rocks at Lizard, wary of both humans and my fellow fish.",
  "llm_answer": "Diary of a Launce, Lizard Cave  \nNight the boat came  \n\nThey were not meant to be here.  \nI had buried myself in the silver sand just inside the mouth, tail flicked under, gills quiet, waiting for moon-time. Then the shadow slid across the water and the walls began to sing. A boat—its belly wood, its breath oars—nosed into my darkness. Daylight leaked in behind it like a wound.  \n\nI held still, but the water heaved with their weight and the walls threw back the thud of their hearts. One of them raised a tube that cracked the air; the sound rolled through the cave like thunder through my spine. I darted deeper, past where the last rose light reaches, until only the green pulse of the surge and the taste of my own fear remained.  \n\nThey did not stay long; the black beyond frightened them more than it frightens me. When the boat turned, its wake lifted the sand and half-buried me again. I waited until the last echo died, then crept back to the entrance. The moon was not yet up; the hunt belongs to later. Tonight I shall lie closer to the open sea.",

You are apt either to chop him right in two, or miss him altogether, when off he wriggles in the sand and disappears. My young people say it requires a practised hand and a peculiar twist of the wrist, to have any success at all in launce fishing. It can only be done on moonlight nights--the full moon and a day or two after--and they are out half the night. They go about barefoot, which is much safer than soaked shoes and stockings. About midnight they light a fire on the sand, cook all the fish they have caught, and have a grand supper, as they had last night. They came home as merry as crickets about two o'clock this morning. Perhaps you might not have noticed what a wonderful moonlight night it was?\" I had; but it would not have occurred to me to spend it in standing for hours up to the knees in salt water, catching unfortunate fish. However, tastes differ, and launce-fishing may be a prime delight to some people; so I faithfully chronicle it, and the proper mode of pursuing it, as one of the attractions at the Lizard. I am not aware that it is practised at any other part",

They have been bathing, and are now going to walk to Cadgwith.\" \"Then nobody fell into the Devil's Throat at Kynance? They all came back to you with whole limbs?\" \"Yes,\" said he smiling, \"and they went again for another long walk in the afternoon. At night, when it turned out to be such splendid moonlight, they actually insisted on going launce-fishing. Of course you know about launce-fishing?\" I pleaded my utter ignorance of that noble sport. \"Oh, it is _the_ thing at the Lizard. My boys--and girls too--consider it the best fun going. The launce is a sort of sand-eel peculiar to these coasts. It swims about all day, and at night burrows in the sand just above the waterline, where, when the moon shines on it, you can trace the silvery gleam of the creature. So you stand up to your ankles on wet sand, with a crooked iron spear which you dart in and hook him up, keeping your left hand free to seize him with.\" \"Easy",

Its only floor is of heaving water, a deep olive green, and so clear that we could see the fishes swimming about pursuing a shoal of launce. Its high-vaulted roof and sides were tinted all colours--rose-pink, rich dark brown, and purple. The entrance was wide enough to admit a boat, but it gradually narrowed into impenetrable darkness. How far inland it goes no one can tell, as it could only be investigated by swimming, a rather dangerous experiment. Boats venture as far as the daylight goes; and it is a favourite trick of the boatman suddenly to fire off a pistol, which reverberates like thunder through the mysterious gloom of the cave. A solemn place; an awful place, some of us thought, as we rowed in, and out again, into the sunshiny open sea. Which we had now got used to; and it was delicious to go dancing like a feather up and down, trusting to John Curgenven's stout arm and fearless, honest face. We felt sad to think this would be our last sight of him and of the magnificent Lizard coast. But the minutes were lessening, and we had some way still to row. Also to land, which meant a leap between the waves upon slippery sea-weedy rocks. In silent dread I watched my children accomplish this feat, and then--",

Hold on, mate, the boat will go right into the cave.\" And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them; while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from which no one could ever hope to come out alive. \"I don't like this at all,\" said a small voice. \"Hadn't we better get out again?\" practically suggested another. But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to return; and begged for \"only five minutes\" in that wonderful place, compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as nothing. They were beautiful, but this was terrible. Yet with its terror was mingled an awful delight. \"Give me but five, nay, two minutes more!\" \"Very well, just as you",

And you'll find a capital tea waiting for you; there isn't a more comfortable inn in all Cornwall.\" Which, we afterwards found, was saying a great deal. Mullion Cove is a good mile from Mullion village, and as we jolted over the rough road I was remorseful over both carriage and horse. \"Not at all, ma'am, he's used to it. Often and often he comes here with pic-nic parties, all the way from Falmouth. I'll put him in at the farm, and be down with you at the Cove directly. You'll find the rocks pretty bad walking, but there's a cave which you ought to see. We'll try it.\" There was no resisting the way the kindly young Cornishman thus identified himself with our interests, and gave himself all sorts of extra trouble on our account. And when after a steep and not too savoury descent--the cove being used as a fish cellar--we found ourselves on the beach, shut in by those grand rocks of serpentine, with Mullion Island lying ahead about a quarter of a mile off, we felt we had not come here for nothing.
