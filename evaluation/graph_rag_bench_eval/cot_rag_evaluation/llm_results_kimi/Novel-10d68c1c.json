The other night I thought you were somewhere out on board a junk, and Flounce with you. I swam like anything, miles and miles, but couldn't get out to you. Worked like steam, and no headway. Flounce knew I was coming, but you didn't. Deuced odd, how real it seemed.\" She laughed, as though they had walked past some danger. \"And speaking of dragons,\" she rejoined. \"They _do_ help. The man in the story, that dipped in dragon's blood, was made invulnerable.\" \"Oh?\" He stood plainly at a loss. \"Oh, I see. German, wasn't he?--Pity they didn't pop Rudie Hackh in!\" Her swift upward glance might have been admiration, if she had not said:-- \"Your mind works very slowly.\" \"Oh?\" Again he paused, as though somewhat hurt; then answered cheerfully: \"Dare say. Always did. Thought at first you meant the rattan-juice kind, from Sumatra.\" The gate of the town yawned black. From the streets glimmered a few lanterns, like candles in a long cave.",

Because of the immediate translations, the reviews of the English original are markedly few, even in journals which gave considerable attention to English literary affairs. The _Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_[1] purposely delays a full review of the book because of the promised translation, and contents itself with the remark, “that we have not read for a long time anything more full of sentiment and humor.” Yet, strangely enough, the translation is never worthily treated, only the new edition of 1771 is mentioned,[2] with especial praise of Füger’s illustrations. Other journals devote long reviews to the new favorite: according to the _Jenaische Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen_[3] all the learned periodicals vied with one",

So far from trading confidences, she had told him only that she was bound straight on to Hongkong; that curiosity alone had led her to travel second-class, \"for the delightful change, you know, from all such formality\"; and that she was \"really more French than English.\" Her reticence had the charm of an incognito; and taking this leaf from her book, he gave himself out as a large, vaguely important person journeying on a large, vague errand. \"But you are a griffin?\" she had said, as they sat together at tea. \"Pardon?\" he ventured, wary and alarmed, wondering whether he could claim this unknown term as in character with his part. \"I mean,\" Miss Forrester explained, smiling, \"it is your first visit to the Far East?\" \"Oh, yes,\" he replied eagerly, blushing. He would have given worlds to say, \"No.\" \"Griffins are such nice little monsters,\" she purred. \"I like them.\" Sometimes at night, waked by the snores of a fat Prussian in the upper berth, he lay staring into the dark, while the ship throbbed in unison with his excited thoughts.

      "text": "The French Revolution profoundly affected the attitude of the French Canadians toward France. Canada was the child of the _ancien regime_. Within her borders the ideas of Voltaire and Rousseau had found no shelter. Canada had nothing in common with the anti-clerical and republican tendencies of the Revolution. That movement created a gap between France and Canada which has not been bridged to this day. In the Napoleonic wars the sympathies of Canada were almost wholly with Great Britain. When news arrived of the defeat of the French fleet at Trafalgar, a _Te Deum_ was sung in the Catholic cathedral at Quebec; and, in a sermon {5} preached on that occasion, a future bishop of the French-Canadian Church enunciated the principle that 'all events which tend to broaden the gap separating us from France should be welcome.' It was during the War of 1812-14, however, that the most striking manifestation of French-Canadian loyalty to the British crown appeared. In that war, in which Canada was repeatedly invaded by American armies, French-Canadian militiamen under French-Canadian officers fought shoulder to shoulder with their English-speaking fellow-countrymen on several stricken fields of battle; and in one engagement, fought at Chateauguay in the French province of Lower Canada, the day was won for British arms by the heroic prowess of Major de Salaberry and his French-Canadian soldiers.

Confusion seized him. \"I have less English to amuse myself with the ladies,\" he answered wildly. Next moment, however, he regained that painful mastery of the tongue which had won his promotion as agent, and stammered: \"Pardon. I would mean, I speak so badly as not to entertain her.\" \"Indeed, you speak very nicely,\" she rejoined, with such a smile as no woman had ever troubled to bestow on him. \"That will be so pleasant, for my German is shocking.\" Dazed by the compliment, by her manner of taking for granted that future conversation which had seemed too good to come true, but above all by her arch, provoking smile, Rudolph sat with his head in a whirl, feeling that the wide eyes of all the second-cabiners were penetrating the tumultuous secret of his breast. Again his English deserted, and left him stammering. But Miss Forrester chatted steadily, appeared to understand murmurs which he himself found obscure, and so restored his confidence that before tiffin was over he talked no less gayly, his honest face alight and glowing. She taught him the names of the strange fruits before them; but though listening and questioning eagerly, he could not afterward have told loquat from pumelo, or custard-apple from",
