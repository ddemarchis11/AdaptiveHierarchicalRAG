Application for the right of performing this piece must be made to the publishers. BOSTON _WALTER H. BAKER_ Copyright, 1893, by ARTHUR W. PINERO _All rights reserved._ INTRODUCTORY NOTE. \"Dandy Dick\" was the third of the farces which Mr. Pinero wrote for the old Court Theatre--a series of plays which, besides giving playgoers a fresh source of laughter, and the English stage a new order of comic play, brought plentiful prosperity to the joint management of Mr. Arthur Cecil and the late Mr. John Clayton. But a kind of melancholy interest attaches to \"Dandy Dick,\" for this play was, as it were, the swan-song of the old theatre and of the Clayton and Cecil partnership; and it was the piece in which Mr. Clayton was acting when death overtook him, to the general grief. The production of \"Dandy Dick\" may be considered as something of a _tour de force_ in its way. \"The Schoolmistress\" was at the end of its successful run, and Mr. Pinero was under contract to supply its successor by a certain date, when Mr. Clayton one day went down to Brighton, where the dramatist was then at work, to hear him read the two completed acts of the new play. To Mr. Clayton's consternation, however, Mr. Pinero announced that he was dissatisfied with his work, and proposed to begin an entirely new play, as he had a more promising idea. But time was pressing, and a successor to \"The Schoolmistress\" was an immediate necessity. However, Mr. Pinero's idea of writing a play round a dean, who, while being a paragon of dignity and decorum, should be driven by an indiscreet act into a most undignified dilemma, appealed to Mr. Clayton, and hastening back to London with the sketches for the requisite scenes, he left Mr. Pinero to set to work at once upon the new scheme. And within a few weeks, indeed by the time the scenery was ready, the new play was completed, the rural constable of a village adjacent to Brighton having suggested the character of Noah Topping. \"Dandy Dick\" was produced at the Court Theatre on January 27th, 1887, and, meeting with a most favorable initial reception, it settled down immediately into a complete success.

My first offence, oh! HANNAH. You're not too old; I want to give you another start in life! THE DEAN. Another start! Woman, do you think I've no conscience? Do you think I don't realize the enormity of the--of the difficulties in alighting from a vehicle in rapid motion? HANNAH. [_Opening the oven and taking out a small joint in a baking tin, which she places on the table._] It's 'unger what makes you feel conscientious! THE DEAN. [_Waving her away._] I have done with you! HANNAH. With me, sir--but not with the joint! You'll feel wickeder when you've had a little nourishment. [_He looks hungrily at the dish._] That's right, Dean, dear--taste my darling Noah's favorite dish. THE DEAN. [_Advancing towards the table._] Oh, Hannah Topping--Hannah Topping! [_Clutching the carving-knife despairingly._] I'll have no more women cooks at the Deanery! This reads me a lesson. [_Sitting and carving with desperation._ HANNAH. Don't stint yourself, sir. You can't blow that whistle on an empty frame. [_THE DEAN begins to eat._] Don't my cooking carry you back, sir? Oh, say it do! THE DEAN. Ah, if every mouthful would carry me back one little hour I would finish this joint! [_NOAH TOPPING, unperceived by HANNAH and THE DEAN, climbs in by the window, his eyes bolting with rage--he glares round the room, taking in everything at a glance._ NOAH. [_Under his breath._] My man o' mystery--a waited on by my nooly made wife--a heating o' my favorite meal. [_Touching HANNAH on the arm, she turns and faces him, speechless with fright._ THE DEAN. [_Still eating._] If my mind were calmer this would be an all-sufficient repast. [_HANNAH tries to speak, then clasps her hands and sinks on her knees to NOAH._] Hannah, a little plain cold water in a simple tumbler, please. NOAH.
