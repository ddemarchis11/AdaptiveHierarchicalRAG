      "text": "robbers bringing plunder. Everywhere, on the stone flags, coolies were dumping down bundles, boxes, jute-bags crammed with heavy objects. Among them, still brawling in bad Hindustani, the little captain gave his orders. At sight of Heywood, however, he began once more to caper, with extravagant grimaces. By his smooth, ruddy face, and tunic of purest white, he seemed a runaway parson gone farther wrong than ever. \"I've come to stay a month!\" he cried; and dancing up, caught Heywood's hands and whirled him about. \"I was fair bursting to see ye, my boy! And here we are, at last!\" Though his cheeks were flushed, and eyes alarmingly bright, he was beyond question sober. Over his head, Heywood and Rudolph exchanged an anxious glance. \"Good! but this is Hackh's house--the nunnery,\" said the one; and the other added, \"You're just in time for dinner.\" The captain found these facts to be excruciating. He clapped Rudolph on the arm, and crowed:-- \"Nunnery? We'll make it a bloomin' chummery!--Dinner be 'anged! A banquet. What's more, I've brought the chow\"--he swept the huddled boxes with a prodigal gesture,--\"lashin's o' food and drink! That's what it is: a banquet!\" He turned again to his sweating followers, and flung the head coolie a handful of silver, crying, \"_Sub-log kiswasti!_ Divide, and be off with ye! _Jao_, ye beggars! Not a pice more. Finish! I'll not spend it all on _you_!\" Then, pouncing on the nearest crate, he burst it open with a ferocious kick. \"Stores? The choicest to be 'ad in all Saigong! Look here\"--He held up a tin and scanned the label triumphantly: \"Chow de Bruxelles, what? Never saw chow spelt with an 'x' before, did ye? French, my boy. Bad spellers, but good cooks, are the French.\" Heywood lost his worried frown. Something had happened,--evidently at Calcutta, for the captain always picked up his vernacular where he dropped his latest cargo; but at all events these vagaries were not the effect of heat or loneliness. \"What's up, Captain?\" he laughed. But now that the coolies had gone, Captain Kneebone's heels were busy, staving open boxes right and left. A bottle rolled out, and smashed in a hissing froth of champagne. \"Plenty more,\" he cried, rejoicing. \"That shows ye how much _I_ care! Oho!\"",

A short bridge curved high, like a camel's hump, over the glimmering half-circle of a single arch. Close by, under a drooping foreground of branches, a stake upheld an oblong placard of neat symbols, like a cartouche to explain a painting. \"It is very beautiful,\" ventured Rudolph, twisting up his blond moustache with satisfaction. \"Very sightly. I would say--picturesque, no?\" \"Very,\" said Heywood, absently. \"Willow Pattern.\" \"And the placard, so finishing, so artistic--That says?\" \"Eh, what? Oh, I wasn't listening.\" Heywood glanced carelessly at the upright sentence. That's a notice:-- \"'Girls May Not be Drowned in This Pond.'\" He started on, without comment. Without reply, Rudolph followed, gathering as he walked the force of this tremendous hint. Slow, far-reaching, it poisoned the elegiac beauty of the scene, alienated the night, and gave to the fading country-side a yet more ancient look, sombre and implacable. He was still pondering this, when across their winding foot-path, with a quick thud of hoofs, swept a pair of equestrian silhouettes. It was half glimpse, half conjecture,--the tough little ponies trotting stubbornly, a rider who leaned across laughing, and a woman who gayly cried at him: \"You really do understand me, don't you?\" The two jogging shadows melted in the bamboo tracery, like things blown down the wind. But for years Rudolph had known the words, the laugh, the beguiling cadence, and could have told what poise of the head went with them, what dangerous glancing light. Suddenly, without reason, he felt a gust of rage. It was he that understood. It was to him these things belonged. The memory of her weakness was lost in the shining memory of her power. He should be riding there, in the dusk of this lonely and cruel land. Heywood had thrown after them a single gloomy stare, down the pointed aisle of bamboos. \"Well matched!\" he growled. \"Chantel--He bounds in the saddle, and he bounds afoot!\" Rudolph knew that he had hated Chantel at sight. He could not bring himself, next day, to join their party for tiffin at the Flowery Pagoda. But in the midst of his brooding, Teppich and the fat Sturgeon assailed the nunnery gate with pot-valiant blows and shouts. They had brought chairs, to carry him off; and being in no mood to fail, though panting and struggling, they packed him into a palanquin with many bottles of the best wine",

      "text": "stand by. You're drinking nothing.\" Rudolph protested. Politeness had so far conquered habit, that he felt uncommonly flushed, genial, and giddy. \"That,\" urged Heywood, tapping the bottle, \"that's our only amusement. You'll see. One good thing we can get is the liquor. 'Nisi damnose bibimus,'--forget how it runs: 'Drink hearty, or you'll die without getting your revenge,'\" \"You are then a university's-man?\" cried Rudolph, with enthusiasm. The other nodded gloomily. On the instant his face had fallen as impassive as that of the Chinese boy who stood behind his chair, straight, rigid, like a waxen image of Gravity in a blue gown.--\"Yes, of sorts. Young fool. Scrapes. Debt. Out to Orient. Same old story. More debt. Trust the firm to encourage that! Debt and debt and debt. Tied up safe. Transfer. Finish! Never go Home.\"--He rose with a laugh and an impatient gesture.--\"Come on. Might as well take in the club as to sit here talking rot.\" Outside the gate of the compound, coolies crouching round a lantern sprang upright and whipped a pair of sedan-chairs into position. Heywood, his feet elevated comfortably over the poles, swung in the lead; Rudolph followed, bobbing in the springy rhythm of the long bamboos. The lanterns danced before them down an open road, past a few blank walls and dark buildings, and soon halted before a whitened front, where light gleamed from the upper story. \"Mind the stairs,\" called Heywood. \"Narrow and beastly dark.\" As they stumbled up the steep flight, Rudolph heard the click of billiard balls. A pair of hanging lamps lighted the room into which he rose,--a low, gloomy loft, devoid of comfort. At the nearer table, a weazened little man bent eagerly over a pictorial paper; at the farther, chalking their cues, stood two players, one a sturdy Englishman with a gray moustache, the other a lithe, graceful person, whose blue coat, smart as an officer's, and swarthy but handsome face made him at a glance the most striking figure in the room. A little Chinese imp in white, who acted as marker, turned on the new-comers a face of preternatural cunning. \"Mr. Wutzler,\" said Heywood. The weazened reader rose in a nervous flutter, underwent his introduction to Rudolph with as much bashful agony as a school-girl, mumbled a few words in German, and instantly took refuge in his tattered _Graphic_. The players, however, advanced in a more friendly fashion. The Englishman, whose name Rudolph did not catch, shook his hand heartily. \"Mr. Hackh is",

He began as a gentleman.--But you're a good sort, Nesbit, to take the affair this fashion.\" Lost in smoke, the clerk grumbled that the gory affair was unmentionable nonsense. \"Quite,\" said Heywood. \"We've tried reasoning. No go. As you say, an accident. That's all can save the youngster now. Impossible, of course.\" He sighed. Then suddenly the gray eyes lighted, became both shrewd and distant; a malicious little smile stole about the corners of his mouth. \"Have-got! The credit's yours, Nesbit. Accident: can do. And this one--by Jove, it won't leave either of 'em a leg to stand on!--Here, mafoo, makee finish!\" He sprang up, clapped a helmet on the shorn head, and stalked out into the sunlight. \"Come on,\" he called. \"It's nearly time. We must pick up our young Hotspur.\" The clerk followed, through the glowing compound and the road. In the shade of the nunnery gate they found Rudolph, who, raising his rattan, saluted them with a pale and stoic gravity. \"Are we ready?\" he asked; and turning, took a slow, cool survey of the nunnery, as though looking his last--from the ditch at their feet to the red tiles, patched with bronze mould, that capped the walls and the roof. \"I never left any place with less regret. Come, let's go.\" The three men had covered some ground before Rudolph broke the silence. \"You'll find a few little things up there in my strong-box, Maurice. Some are marked for you, and the rest--will you send them Home, please?\" He hesitated. \"I hope neither of you will misunderstand me. I'm horribly afraid, but not--but only because this fellow will make me look absurd. If I knew the first motion!\" He broke out angrily. \"I cannot bear to have him laugh, also! I cannot bear!\" Heywood clapped him on the shoulder, and gave a queer cough. \"If that's all, never you fear! I'll teach you your guard. 'Once in a while we can finish in style.' Eh?--Rudie, you blooming German, I--I think we must have been brothers! We'll pull it off yet.\" Heywood spoke with a strange alacrity, and tried again to cough. This time, however, there was no mistake--he was laughing. Rudolph shot at him one glance of startled unbelief, and then, tossing his head, marched on without a word. Pride and",

An imp in white and red livery, Peng, the little billiard-marker from the club, stood hurling things violently into the outer glare. \"What thing you do?\" called Rudolph, sharply. Some small but heavy object clattered on the floor. The urchin stooped, snatched it up, and flung it hurtling clean over the garden to the river. He turned, grinning amiably. \"Goo-moh? ning-seh. How too you too,\" he chanted. \"I am welly? glat to-see you.\" A boat-coolie, he explained, had called this house bad names. He, Peng, threw stones. Bad man. \"Out of here, you rascal!\" Rudolph flicked a riding-whip at the scampering legs, as the small defender of his honor bolted for the stairs. \"What's wrong?\" Heywood appeared promptly at the door. From the road, below, a gleeful voice piped:-- \"Goat-men! Baby-killers!\" In the noon blaze, Peng skipped derisively, jeered at them, performed a brief but indecorous pantomime, and then, kicking up his heels with joy, scurried for his life. \"Chucked his billet,\" said Heywood, without surprise. \"Little devil, I always thought--What's missing?\" Rudolph scanned his meagre belongings, rummaged his dressing-table, opened a wardrobe. \"Nothing,\" he answered. \"A boat-coolie--\" But Heywood had darted to the rack of Mausers, knelt, and sprung up, raging. \"Side-bolts! Man,\" he cried, in a voice that made Rudolph jump,--\"man, why didn't you stop him? The side-bolts, all but two.--Young heathen, he's crippled us: one pair of rifles left.\" CHAPTER XIV OFF DUTY The last of the sunlight streamed level through a gap in the western ridges. It melted, with sinuous, tender shadows, the dry contour of field and knoll, and poured over all the parching land a liquid, undulating grace. Like the shadow of clouds on ripe corn, the red tiles of the village roofs patched the countryside. From the distant sea had come a breath of air, cool enough to be felt with gratitude, yet so faint as neither to disturb the dry pulsation of myriad insect-voices, nor to blur the square mirrors of distant rice-fields, still tropically blue or icy with reflected clouds. Miss Drake paused on the knoll, and looked about her. \"This remains the same, doesn't it, for",
