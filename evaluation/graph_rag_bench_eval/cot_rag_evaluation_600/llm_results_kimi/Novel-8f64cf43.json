Some bacon and eggs and green things and coffee.\" VAN BIBBER AS BEST MAN Young Van Bibber came up to town in June from Newport to see his lawyer about the preparation of some papers that needed his signature. He found the city very hot and close, and as dreary and as empty as a house that has been shut up for some time while its usual occupants are away in the country. As he had to wait over for an afternoon train, and as he was down town, he decided to lunch at a French restaurant near Washington Square, where some one had told him you could get particular things particularly well cooked. The tables were set on a terrace with plants and flowers about them, and covered with a tricolored awning. There were no jangling horse-car bells nor dust to disturb him, and almost all the other tables were unoccupied. The waiters leaned against these tables and chatted in a French argot; and a cool breeze blew through the plants and billowed the awning, so that, on the whole, Van Bibber was glad he had come. There was, beside himself, an old Frenchman scolding over his late breakfast; two young artists with Van <DW18> beards, who ordered the most remarkable things in the same French argot that the waiters spoke; and a young lady and a young gentleman at the table next to his own. The young man's back was toward him, and he could only see the girl when the youth moved to one side. She was very young and very pretty, and she seemed in a most excited state of mind from the tip of her wide-brimmed, pointed French hat to the points of her patent-leather ties. She was strikingly well-bred in appearance, and Van Bibber wondered why she should be dining alone with so young a man. \"It wasn't my fault,\" he heard the youth say earnestly. \"How could I know he would be out of town? and anyway it really doesn't matter. Your cousin is not the only clergyman in the city.\" \"Of course not,\" said the girl, almost tearfully, \"but they're not my cousins and he is, and that would have made it so much, oh, so very much different. I'm awfully frightened!\" \"Runaway couple,\" commented Van Bibber. \"Most interesting. Read about 'em often; never seen 'em. Most interesting.\" He bent his head over an entree, but he could not help hearing what followed, for the young runaways were indifferent to all around them, and though he rattled his knife and fork in a most vulgar",

      "text": "that door where the servant will see them before the milkman does, and walk on out ahead of me, and keep your hands in your pockets, and don't try to run. I have your pistol, you know.\" The man placed the bags inside the kitchen door; and, with a doubtful look at his custodian, stepped out into the street, and walked, as he was directed to do, toward the Grand Central station. Van Bibber kept just behind him, and kept turning the question over in his mind as to what he ought to do. He felt very guilty as he passed each policeman, but he recovered himself when he thought of the wife and child who lived in the West, and who were \"straight.\" \"Where to?\" asked Van Bibber, as he stood at the ticket-office window. \"Helena, Montana,\" answered the man with, for the first time, a look of relief. Van Bibber bought the ticket and handed it to the burglar. \"I suppose you know,\" he said, \"that you can sell that at a place down town for half the money.\" \"Yes, I know that,\" said the burglar. There was a half-hour before the train left, and Van Bibber took his charge into the restaurant and watched him eat everything placed before him, with his eyes glancing all the while to the right or left. Then Van Bibber gave him some money and told him to write to him, and shook hands with him. The man nodded eagerly and pulled off his hat as the car drew out of the station; and Van Bibber came down town again with the shop girls and clerks going to work, still wondering if he had done the right thing. He went to his rooms and changed his clothes, took a cold bath, and crossed over to Delmonico's for his breakfast, and, while the waiter laid the cloth in the cafe, glanced at the headings in one of the papers. He scanned first with polite interest the account of the dance on the night previous and noticed his name among those present. With greater interest he read of the fight between \"Dutchy\" Mack and the \"Black Diamond,\" and then he read carefully how \"Abe\" Hubbard, alias \"Jimmie the Gent,\" a burglar, had broken jail in New Jersey, and had been traced to New York. There was a description of the man, and Van Bibber breathed quickly as he read it. \"The detectives have a clew of his whereabouts,\" the account said; \"if he is still in the city they are confident of recapturing him. But they fear that the same friends who helped him to break jail will probably assist him from the country or to get out West.\" \"They may do that,\" murmured Van Bibber to himself, with a smile of grim contentment; \"they probably will.\" Then he said to the waiter, \"Oh, I don't know.",

      "text": "one would go on a honeymoon. But I'm not used to lying and I'm not very good at it. Now, if you will introduce me, I'll see what can be done toward getting you two babes out of the woods.\" Standish said, \"Miss Cambridge, this is Mr. Cortlandt Van Bibber, of whom you have heard my brother speak,\" and Miss Cambridge said she was very glad to meet Mr. Van Bibber even under such peculiarly trying circumstances. \"Now what you two want to do,\" said Van Bibber, addressing them as though they were just about fifteen years old and he were at least forty, \"is to give this thing all the publicity you can.\" \"What?\" chorused the two runaways, in violent protest. \"Certainly,\" said Van Bibber. \"You were about to make a fatal mistake. You were about to go to some unknown clergyman of an unknown parish, who would have married you in a back room, without a certificate or a witness, just like any eloping farmer's daughter and lightning-rod agent. Now it's different with you two. Why you were not married respectably in church I don't know, and I do not intend to ask, but a kind Providence has sent me to you to see that there is no talk nor scandal, which is such bad form, and which would have got your names into all the papers. I am going to arrange this wedding properly, and you will kindly remain here until I send a carriage for you. Now just rely on me entirely and eat your luncheon in peace. It's all going to come out right--and allow me to recommend the salad, which is especially good.\" Van Bibber first drove madly to the Little Church Around the Corner, where he told the kind old rector all about it, and arranged to have the church open and the assistant organist in her place, and a district-messenger boy to blow the bellows, punctually at three o'clock. \"And now,\" he soliloquized, \"I must get some names. It doesn't matter much whether they happen to know the high contracting parties or not, but they must be names that everybody knows. Whoever is in town will be lunching at Delmonico's, and the men will be at the clubs.\" So he first went to the big restaurant, where, as good luck would have it, he found Mrs. \"Regy\" Van Arnt and Mrs. \"Jack\" Peabody, and the Misses Brookline, who had run up the Sound for the day on the yacht _Minerva_ of the Boston Yacht Club, and he told them how things were and swore them to secrecy, and told them to bring what men they could pick up. At the club he pressed four men into service who knew everybody and whom everybody knew, and when they protested that they had not been properly invited and that they",

Don't try to smuggle in any laces, and don't forget to fee the smoking-room steward.\" The Girl He Knew said they were walking over to the stables, and that he had better go get his other horse and join her, which was to be his reward for taking care of the young ladies. And the three little girls proceeded to use up the yards of tickets so industriously that they were sunburned when they reached the tenement, and went to bed dreaming of a big white swan, and a beautiful young gentleman in patent-leather riding-boots and baggy breeches. VAN BIBBER'S BURGLAR There had been a dance up town, but as Van Bibber could not find Her there, he accepted young Travers's suggestion to go over to Jersey City and see a \"go\" between \"Dutchy\" Mack and a <DW52> person professionally known as the Black Diamond. They covered up all signs of their evening dress with their great-coats, and filled their pockets with cigars, for the smoke which surrounds a \"go\" is trying to sensitive nostrils, and they also fastened their watches to both key-chains. Alf Alpin, who was acting as master of ceremonies, was greatly pleased and flattered at their coming, and boisterously insisted on their sitting on the platform. The fact was generally circulated among the spectators that the \"two gents in high hats\" had come in a carriage, and this and their patent-leather boots made them objects of keen interest. It was even whispered that they were the \"parties\" who were putting up the money to back the Black Diamond against the \"Hester Street Jackson.\" This in itself entitled them to respect. Van Bibber was asked to hold the watch, but he wisely declined the honor, which was given to Andy Spielman, the sporting reporter of the _Track and Ring_, whose watch-case was covered with diamonds, and was just the sort of a watch a timekeeper should hold. It was two o'clock before \"Dutchy\" Mack's backer threw the sponge into the air, and three before they reached the city. They had another reporter in the cab with them besides the gentleman who had bravely held the watch in the face of several offers to \"do for\" him; and as Van Bibber was ravenously hungry, and as he doubted that he could get anything at that hour at the club, they accepted Spielman's invitation and went for a porterhouse steak and onions at the Owl's Nest, Gus McGowan's all-night restaurant on Third Avenue. It was a very dingy, dirty place, but it was as warm as the engine-room of a steamboat, and the steak was perfectly done and",

He had told his groom to bring a horse he wanted to try to the Fifty-ninth Street entrance at ten o'clock, and the groom had not appeared. Hence Van Bibber's crossness. He waited as long as his dignity would allow, and then turned off into a by-lane end dropped on a bench and looked gloomily at the Lohengrin swans with the paddle-wheel attachment that circle around the lake. They struck him as the most idiotic inventions he had ever seen, and he pitied, with the pity of a man who contemplates crossing the ocean to be measured for his fall clothes, the people who could find delight in having some one paddle them around an artificial lake. Two little girls from the East Side, with a lunch basket, and an older girl with her hair down her back, sat down on a bench beside him and gazed at the swans. The place was becoming too popular, and Van Bibber decided to move on. But the bench on which he sat was in the shade, and the asphalt walk leading to the street was in the sun, and his cigarette was soothing, so he ignored the near presence of the three little girls, and remained where he was. \"I s'pose,\" said one of the two little girls, in a high, public school voice, \"there's lots to see from those swan-boats that youse can't see from the banks.\" \"Oh, lots,\" assented the girl with long hair. \"If you walked all round the lake, clear all the way round, you could see all there is to see,\" said the third, \"except what there's in the middle where the island is.\" \"I guess it's mighty wild on that island,\" suggested the youngest. \"Eddie Case he took a trip around the lake on a swan-boat the other day. He said that it was grand. He said youse could see fishes and ducks, and that it looked just as if there were snakes and things on the island.\" \"What sort of things?\" asked the other one, in a hushed voice. \"Well, wild things,\" explained the elder, vaguely; \"bears and animals like that, that grow in wild places.\" Van Bibber lit a fresh cigarette, and settled himself comfortably and unreservedly to listen. \"My, but I'd like to take a trip just once,\" said the youngest, under her breath. Then she",
