The editor was glad to find him so much better. \"Gad, sir, no bones broken, but a good deal of 'possum scratching about the head for such a little throw like that. I must have slid a yard or two on my left ear before I brought up.\" \"You were unconscious from the fall, I believe.\" \"Only for an instant, sir--a single instant! I recovered myself with the assistance of a No'the'n gentleman--a Mr. Parmlee--who was passing.\" \"Then you think your injuries were entirely due to your fall?\" The colonel paused with the mint julep halfway to his lips, and set it down. \"Sir!\" he ejaculated, with astounded indignation. \"You say you were unconscious,\" returned the editor lightly, \"and some of your friends think the injuries inconsistent with what you believe to be the cause. They are concerned lest you were unknowingly the victim of some foul play.\" \"Unknowingly! Sir! Do you take me for a chuckle-headed niggah, that I don't know when I'm thrown from a buck-jumping mustang? or do they think I'm a Chinaman to be hustled and beaten by a gang of bullies? Do they know, sir, that the account I have given I am responsible for, sir?--personally responsible?\" There was no doubt to the editor that the colonel was perfectly serious, and that the indignation arose from no guilty consciousness of a secret. A man as peppery as the colonel would have been equally alert in defense. \"They feared that you might have been ill used by some evilly disposed person during your unconsciousness,\" explained the editor diplomatically; \"but as you say THAT was only for a moment, and that you were aware of everything that happened\"--He paused. \"Perfectly, sir! Perfectly! As plain as I see this julep before me. I had just left the Ramierez rancho. The senora,--a devilish pretty woman, sir,--after a little playful badinage, had offered to lend me her daughter's mustang if I could ride it home. You know what it is, Mr. Grey,\" he said gallantly. \"I'm an older man than you, sir, but a challenge from a d----d fascinating creature, I trust, sir, I am not yet old enough to decline. Gad, sir, I mounted the brute. I've ridden Morgan stock and Blue Grass thoroughbreds bareback, sir, but I've never thrown my leg over such a blanked Chinese cracker before. After he bolted I held my own fairly, but he buck-jumped before I could lock my spurs under him, and the second jump landed me!\" \"How far from the Ramierez fonda were you when you were thrown?\" \"A matter of four",

His political influence would be ruined here!\" The editor was momentarily staggered at this large truth. \"Nonsense!\" he said, with a laugh. \"Who would attack Colonel Starbottle in that fashion? He might have been shot on sight by some political enemy with whom he had quarreled--but not BEATEN.\" \"S'pose it warn't no political enemy?\" said the foreman doggedly. \"Then who else could it be?\" demanded the editor impatiently. \"That's jest for the press to find out and expose,\" returned the foreman, with a significant glance at the editor's desk. \"I reckon that's whar the 'Clarion' ought to come in.\" \"In a matter of this kind,\" said the editor promptly, \"the paper has no business to interfere with a man's statement. The colonel has a perfect right to his own secret--if there is one, which I very much doubt. But,\" he added, in laughing recognition of the half reproachful, half humorous discontent on the foreman's face, \"what dreadful theory have YOU and the boys got about it--and what do YOU expect to expose?\" \"Well,\" said the foreman very seriously, \"it's jest this: You see, the colonel is mighty sweet on that Spanish woman Ramierez up on the hill yonder. It was her mustang he was ridin' when the row happened near her house.\" \"Well?\" said the editor, with disconcerting placidity. \"Well,\"--hesitated the foreman, \"you see, they're a bad lot, those Greasers, especially the Ramierez, her husband.\" The editor knew that the foreman was only echoing the provincial prejudice against this race, which he himself had always combated. Ramierez kept a fonda or hostelry on a small estate,--the last of many leagues formerly owned by the Spanish grantee, his landlord,--and had a wife of some small coquetries and redundant charms. Gambling took place at the fonda, and it was said the common prejudice against the Mexican did not, however, prevent the American from trying to win his money. \"Then you think Ramierez was jealous of the colonel? But in that case he would have knifed him,--Spanish fashion,--and not without a struggle.\" \"There's more ways they have o' killin' a man than that; he might hev been dragged off his horse by a lasso and choked,\" said the foreman darkly. The editor had heard of this vaquero method of putting an enemy hors de combat; but it was a clumsy",

For in that case, I may say, without vanity, that--er--the--er senora would have come to my assistance.\" \"But not her husband?\" The old-fashioned shirt-frill which the colonel habitually wore grew erectile with a swelling indignation, possibly half assumed to conceal a certain conscious satisfaction beneath. \"Mr. Grey,\" he said, with pained severity, \"as a personal friend of mine, and a representative of the press,--a power which I respect,--I overlook a disparaging reflection upon a lady, which I can only attribute to the levity of youth and thoughtlessness. At the same time, sir,\" he added, with illogical sequence, \"if Ramierez felt aggrieved at my attentions, he knew where I could be found, sir, and that it was not my habit to decline giving gentlemen--of any nationality--satisfaction--sir!--personal satisfaction.\" He paused, and then added, with a singular blending of anxiety and a certain natural dignity, \"I trust, sir, that nothing of this--er--kind will appear in your paper.\" \"It was to keep it out by learning the truth from you, my dear colonel,\" said the editor lightly, \"that I called to-day. Why, it was even suggested,\" he added, with a laugh, \"that you were half strangled by a lasso.\" To his surprise the colonel did not join in the laugh, but brought his hand to his loose cravat with an uneasy gesture and a somewhat disturbed face. \"I admit, sir,\" he said, with a forced smile, \"that I experienced a certain sensation of choking, and I may have mentioned it to Mr. Parmlee; but it was due, I believe, sir, to my cravat, which I always wear loosely, as you perceive, becoming twisted in my fall, and in rolling over.\" He extended his fat white hand to the editor, who shook it cordially, and then withdrew. Nevertheless, although perfectly satisfied with his mission, and firmly resolved to prevent any further discussion on the subject, Mr. Grey's curiosity was not wholly appeased. What were the relations of the colonel with the Ramierez family? From what he himself had said, the theory of the foreman as to the motives of the attack might have been possible, and the assault itself committed while the colonel was unconscious. Mr. Grey, however, kept this to himself, briefly told his foreman that he",

Senor Ramierez was not aware of any suspicious loiterers among the frequenters of the fonda, and except from some drunken American or Irish revelers he had been free of disturbance. Ah! the peon--an old vaquero--was not an angel, truly, but he was dangerous only to the bull and the wild horses--and he was afraid even of Cota! Mr. Grey was fain to ride home empty of information. He was still more concerned a week later, on returning unexpectedly one afternoon to his sanctum, to hear a musical, childish voice in the composing-room. It was Cota! She was there, as Richards explained, on his invitation, to view the marvels and mysteries of printing at a time when they would not be likely to \"disturb Mr. Grey at his work.\" But the beaming face of Richards and the simple tenderness of his blue eyes plainly revealed the sudden growth of an evidently sincere passion, and the unwonted splendors of his best clothes showed how carefully he had prepared for the occasion. Grey was worried and perplexed, believing the girl a malicious flirt. Yet nothing could be more captivating than her simple and childish curiosity, as she watched Richards swing the lever of the press, or stood by his side as he marshaled the type into files on his \"composing-stick.\" He had even printed a card with her name, \"Senorita Cota Ramierez,\" the type of which had been set up, to the accompaniment of ripples of musical laughter, by her little brown fingers. The editor might have become quite sentimental and poetical had he not noticed that the gray eyes which often rested tentatively and meaningly on himself, even while apparently listening to Richards, were more than ever like the eyes of the mustang on whose scarred flanks her glance had wandered so coldly. He withdrew presently so as not to interrupt his foreman's innocent tete-a-tete, but it was not very long after that Cota passed him on the highroad with the pinto horse in a gallop, and blew him an audacious kiss from the tips of her fingers. For several days afterwards Richards's manner was tinged with a certain reserve on the subject of Cota which the editor attributed to the delicacy of a serious affection, but he was surprised also to find that his foreman's eagerness to discuss his unknown assailant had somewhat abated. Further discussion regarding it naturally dropped, and the editor was beginning to lose his curiosity when it was suddenly awakened by a chance incident. An intimate friend and old companion of his--one Enriquez Saltillo--had diverged from a mountain trip especially to call upon him. Enriquez was a scion of one of the oldest Spanish-California families, and in",

She dropped like a shot, he dexterously withdrawing his spurs, and regaining his seat, jarred but not discomfited. Again she essayed a leap; the spurs again marked its height in a scarifying track along her smooth barrel. She tried a third leap, but this time dropped halfway as she felt the steel scraping her side, and then stood still, trembling. Grey leaped off! There was a sound of applause from the innkeeper and his wife, assisted by a lounging vaquero in the corridor. Ashamed of his victory, Grey turned apologetically to Cota. To his surprise she glanced indifferently at the trickling sides of her favorite, and only regarded him curiously. \"Ah,\" she said, drawing in her breath, \"you are strong--and you comprehend!\" \"It was only a trick for a trick, senorita,\" he replied, reddening; \"let me look after those scratches in the stable,\" he added, as she was turning away, leading the agitated and excited animal toward a shed in the rear. He would have taken the riata which she was still holding, but she motioned him to precede her. He did so by a few feet, but he had scarcely reached the stable door before she suddenly caught him roughly by the shoulders, and, shoving him into the entrance, slammed the door upon him. Amazed and a little indignant, he turned in time to hear a slight sound of scuffling outside, and to see Cota re-enter with a flushed face. \"Pardon, senor,\" she said quickly, \"but I feared she might have kicked you. Rest tranquil, however, for the servant he has taken her away.\" She pointed to a slouching peon with a malevolent face, who was angrily driving the mustang toward the corral. \"Consider it no more! I was rude! Santa Maria! I almost threw you, too; but,\" she added, with a dazzling smile, \"you must not punish me as you have her! For you are very strong--and you comprehend.\" But Grey did not comprehend, and with a few hurried apologies he managed to escape his fair but uncanny tormentor. Besides, this unlooked-for incident had driven from his mind the more important object of his visit,--the discovery of the assailants of Richards and Colonel Starbottle.
