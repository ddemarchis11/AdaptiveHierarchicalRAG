He had told his groom to bring a horse he wanted to try to the Fifty-ninth Street entrance at ten o'clock, and the groom had not appeared. Hence Van Bibber's crossness. He waited as long as his dignity would allow, and then turned off into a by-lane end dropped on a bench and looked gloomily at the Lohengrin swans with the paddle-wheel attachment that circle around the lake. They struck him as the most idiotic inventions he had ever seen, and he pitied, with the pity of a man who contemplates crossing the ocean to be measured for his fall clothes, the people who could find delight in having some one paddle them around an artificial lake. Two little girls from the East Side, with a lunch basket, and an older girl with her hair down her back, sat down on a bench beside him and gazed at the swans. The place was becoming too popular, and Van Bibber decided to move on. But the bench on which he sat was in the shade, and the asphalt walk leading to the street was in the sun, and his cigarette was soothing, so he ignored the near presence of the three little girls, and remained where he was. \"I s'pose,\" said one of the two little girls, in a high, public school voice, \"there's lots to see from those swan-boats that youse can't see from the banks.\" \"Oh, lots,\" assented the girl with long hair. \"If you walked all round the lake, clear all the way round, you could see all there is to see,\" said the third, \"except what there's in the middle where the island is.\" \"I guess it's mighty wild on that island,\" suggested the youngest. \"Eddie Case he took a trip around the lake on a swan-boat the other day. He said that it was grand. He said youse could see fishes and ducks, and that it looked just as if there were snakes and things on the island.\" \"What sort of things?\" asked the other one, in a hushed voice. \"Well, wild things,\" explained the elder, vaguely; \"bears and animals like that, that grow in wild places.\" Van Bibber lit a fresh cigarette, and settled himself comfortably and unreservedly to listen. \"My, but I'd like to take a trip just once,\" said the youngest, under her breath.

RAEGEN THE OTHER WOMAN THE TRAILER FOR ROOM NO. 8 \"THERE WERE NINETY AND NINE\" THE CYNICAL MISS CATHERWAIGHT VAN BIBBER AND THE SWAN-BOATS VAN BIBBER'S BURGLAR VAN BIBBER AS BEST MAN GALLEGHER A Newspaper Story {Illustration: \"Why, it's Gallegher!\" said the night editor.} We had had so many office-boys before Gallegher came among us that they had begun to lose the characteristics of individuals, and became merged in a composite photograph of small boys, to whom we applied the generic title of \"Here, you\"; or \"You, boy.\" We had had sleepy boys, and lazy boys, and bright, \"smart\" boys, who became so familiar on so short an acquaintance that we were forced to part with them to save our own self-respect. They generally graduated into district-messenger boys, and occasionally returned to us in blue coats with nickel-plated buttons, and patronized us. But Gallegher was something different from anything we had experienced before. Gallegher was short and broad in build, with a solid, muscular broadness, and not a fat and dumpy shortness. He wore perpetually on his face a happy and knowing smile, as if you and the world in general were not impressing him as seriously as you thought you were, and his eyes, which were very black and very bright, snapped intelligently at you like those of a little black-and-tan terrier. All Gallegher knew had been learnt on the streets; not a very good school in itself, but one that turns out very knowing scholars. And Gallegher had attended both morning and evening sessions. He could not tell you who the Pilgrim Fathers were, nor could he name the thirteen original States, but he knew all the officers of the twenty-second police district by name, and he could distinguish the clang of a fire-engine's gong from that of a patrol-wagon or an ambulance fully two blocks distant. It was Gallegher who rang the alarm when the Woolwich Mills caught fire, while the officer on the beat was asleep, and it was Gallegher who led the \"Black Diamonds\" against the \"Wharf Rats,\" when they used to stone each other to their hearts' content on the coal-wharves of Richmond.

They were hushed in silent ecstasy when it started, and gave little gasps of pleasure when it careened slightly in turning. It was shady under the awning, and the motion was pleasant enough, but Van Bibber was so afraid some one would see him that he failed to enjoy it. But as soon as they passed into the narrow straits and were shut in by the bushes and were out of sight of the people, he relaxed, and began to play the host. He pointed out the fishes among the rocks at the edges of the pool, and the sparrows and robins bathing and ruffling their feathers in the shallow water, and agreed with them about the possibility of bears, and even tigers, in the wild part of the island, although the glimpse of the gray helmet of a Park policeman made such a supposition doubtful. And it really seemed as though they were enjoying it more than he ever enjoyed a trip up the Sound on a yacht or across the ocean on a record-breaking steamship. It seemed long enough before they got back to Van Bibber, but his guests were evidently but barely satisfied. Still, all the goodness in his nature would not allow him to go through that ordeal again. He stepped out of the boat eagerly and helped out the girl with long hair as though she had been a princess and tipped the rude young man who had laughed at him, but who was perspiring now with the work he had done; and then as he turned to leave the dock he came face to face with A Girl He Knew and Her brother. Her brother said, \"How're you, Van Bibber? Been taking a trip around the world in eighty minutes?\" And added in a low voice, \"Introduce me to your young lady friends from Hester Street.\" \"Ah, how're you--quite a surprise!\" gasped Van Bibber, while his late guests stared admiringly at the pretty young lady in the riding-habit, and utterly refused to move on. \"Been taking ride on the lake,\" stammered Van Bibber; \"most exhilarating. Young friends of mine--these young ladies never rode on lake, so I took 'em. Did you see me?\" \"Oh, yes, we saw you,\" said Her brother, dryly, while she only smiled at him, but so kindly and with such perfect understanding that Van Bibber grew red with pleasure and bought three long strings of tickets for the swans at some absurd discount, and gave each little girl a string. \"There,\" said Her brother to the little ladies from Hester Street, \"now you can take trips for a week without stopping. Don't try to smuggle in any laces, and don't forget to fee the smoking-room steward.\" The Girl He",

Then she clasped her fingers together and looked up anxiously at the elder girl, who glanced at her with severe reproach. \"Why, Mame!\" she said; \"ain't you ashamed! Ain't you having a good time 'nuff without wishing for everything you set your eyes on?\" Van Bibber wondered at this--why humans should want to ride around on the swans in the first place, and why, if they had such a wild desire, they should not gratify it. \"Why, it costs more'n it costs to come all the way up town in an open car,\" added the elder girl, as if in answer to his unspoken question. The younger girl sighed at this, and nodded her head in submission, but blinked longingly at the big swans and the parti- awning and the red seats. \"I beg your pardon,\" said Van Bibber, addressing himself uneasily to the eldest girl with long hair, \"but if the little girl would like to go around in one of those things, and--and hasn't brought the change with her, you know, I'm sure I should be very glad if she'd allow me to send her around.\" \"Oh! will you?\" exclaimed the little girl, with a jump, and so sharply and in such a shrill voice that Van Bibber shuddered. But the elder girl objected. \"I'm afraid maw wouldn't like our taking money from any one we didn't know,\" she said with dignity; \"but if you're going anyway and want company--\" \"Oh! my, no,\" said Van Bibber, hurriedly. He tried to picture himself riding around the lake behind a tin swan with three little girls from the East Side, and a lunch basket. \"Then,\" said the head of the trio, \"we can't go.\" There was such a look of uncomplaining acceptance of this verdict on the part of the two little girls, that Van Bibber felt uncomfortable. He looked to the right and to the left, and then said desperately, \"Well, come along.\" The young man in a blue flannel shirt, who did the paddling, smiled at Van Bibber's riding-breeches, which were so very loose at one end and so very tight at the other, and at his gloves and crop. But Van Bibber pretended not to care. The three little girls placed the awful lunch basket on the front seat and sat on the middle one, and Van Bibber cowered in the back.

Then he stepped quickly to where it lay and picked it up and said, \"Now, if you try to get up I'll shoot at you.\" He felt an unwarranted and ill-timedly humorous inclination to add, \"and I'll probably miss you,\" but subdued it. The burglar, much to Van Bibber's astonishment, did not attempt to rise, but sat up with his hands locked across his knees and said: \"Shoot ahead. I'd a damned sight rather you would.\" His teeth were set and his face desperate and bitter, and hopeless to a degree of utter hopelessness that Van Bibber had never imagined. \"Go ahead,\" reiterated the man, doggedly, \"I won't move. Shoot me.\" It was a most unpleasant situation. Van Bibber felt the pistol loosening in his hand, and he was conscious of a strong inclination to lay it down and ask the burglar to tell him all about it. \"You haven't got much heart,\" said Van Bibber, finally. \"You're a pretty poor sort of a burglar, I should say.\" \"What's the use?\" said the man, fiercely. \"I won't go back--I won't go back there alive. I've served my time forever in that hole. If I have to go back again--s'help me if I don't do for a keeper and die for it. But I won't serve there no more.\" \"Go back where?\" asked Van Bibber, gently, and greatly interested; \"to prison?\" \"To prison, yes!\" cried the man, hoarsely: \"to a grave. That's where. Look at my face,\" he said, \"and look at my hair. That ought to tell you where I've been. With all the color gone out of my skin, and all the life out of my legs. You needn't be afraid of me. I couldn't hurt you if I wanted to. I'm a skeleton and a baby, I am. I couldn't kill a cat. And now you're going to send me back again for another lifetime. For twenty years, this time, into that cold, forsaken hole, and after I done my time so well and worked so hard.\" Van Bibber shifted the pistol from one hand to the other and eyed his prisoner doubtfully. \"How long have you been out?\" he asked, seating himself on the steps of the kitchen and holding the revolver between his knees. The sun was driving the morning mist away, and he had forgotten the cold. \"I got out yesterday,\" said the man. Van Bibber glanced at the bags and lifted the revolver. \"You didn't waste much time,\" he said.",
