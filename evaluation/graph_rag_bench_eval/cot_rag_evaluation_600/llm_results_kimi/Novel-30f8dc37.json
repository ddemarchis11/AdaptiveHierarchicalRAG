BILSON'S HOUSEKEEPER FROM SAND HILL TO PINE A NIECE OF SNAPSHOT HARRY'S I There was a slight jarring though the whole frame of the coach, a grinding and hissing from the brakes, and then a sudden jolt as the vehicle ran upon and recoiled from the taut pole-straps of the now arrested horses. The murmur of a voice in the road was heard, followed by the impatient accents of Yuba Bill, the driver. \"Wha-a-t? Speak up, can't ye?\" Here the voice uttered something in a louder key, but equally unintelligible to the now interested and fully awakened passengers. One of them dropped the window nearest him and looked out. He could see the faint glistening of a rain-washed lantern near the wheelers' heads, mingling with the stronger coach lights, and the glow of a distant open cabin door through the leaves and branches of the roadside. The sound of falling rain on the roof, a soft swaying of wind-tossed trees, and an impatient movement on the box-seat were all they heard. Then Yuba Bill's voice rose again, apparently in answer to the other. \"Why, that's half a mile away!\" \"Yes, but ye might have dropped onto it in the dark, and it's all on the down grade,\" responded the strange voice more audibly. The passengers were now thoroughly aroused. \"What's up, Ned?\" asked the one at the window of the nearest of two figures that had descended from the box. \"Tree fallen across the road,\" said Ned, the expressman, briefly. \"I don't see no tree,\" responded the passenger, leaning out of the window towards the obscurity ahead. \"Now, that's onfortnit!\" said Yuba Bill grimly; \"but ef any gentleman will only lend him an opery glass, mebbe he can see round the curve and over the other side o' the hill where it is. Now, then,\" addressing the stranger with the lantern, \"bring along your axes, can't ye?\" \"Here's one, Bill,\" said an officious outside passenger, producing the instrument he had taken from its strap in the boot. It was the \"regulation\" axe, beautifully shaped, highly polished, and utterly ineffective, as Bill well knew. \"We ain't cuttin' no kindlin's,\" he said scornfully; then he added brusquely to the stranger: \"Fetch out your biggest wood axe--you've got one, ye know--and look sharp.\"",

Seen from the coach top, the horses appeared to be cleaving their way through a dark, shining olive sea, that parted before and closed behind them, as they slowly passed. The leaders were just emerging from it, and Bill was gathering up his slackened reins, when a peremptory voice called, \"Halt!\" At the same moment the coach lights flashed upon a masked and motionless horseman in the road. Bill made an impulsive reach for his whip, but in the same instant checked himself, reined in his horses with a suppressed oath, and sat perfectly rigid. Not so the expressman, who caught up his rifle, but it was arrested by Bill's arm, and his voice in his ear! \"Too late!--we're covered!--don't be a d----d fool!\" The inside passengers, still encompassed by obscurity, knew only that the stage had stopped. The \"outsiders\" knew, by experience, that they were covered by unseen guns in the wayside branches, and scarcely moved. \"I didn't think it was the square thing to stop you, Bill, till you'd got through your work,\" said a masterful but not unpleasant voice, \"and if you'll just hand down the express box, I'll pass you and the rest of your load through free. But as we're both in a hurry, you'd better look lively about it.\" \"Hand it down,\" said Bill gruffly to the expressman. The expressman turned with a white check but blazing eyes to the compartment below his seat. He lingered, apparently in some difficulty with the lock of the compartment, but finally brought out the box and handed it to another armed and masked figure that appeared mysteriously from the branches beside the wheels. \"Thank you!\" said the voice; \"you can slide on now.\" \"And thank you for nothing,\" said Bill, gathering up his reins. \"It's the first time any of your kind had to throw down a tree to hold me up!\" \"You're lying, Bill!--though you don't know it,\" said the voice cheerfully. \"Far from throwing down a tree to stop you, it was I sent word along the road to warn you from crashing down upon it, and sending you and your load to h-ll before your time! Drive on!\" The angry Bill waited for no second comment, but laying his whip over the backs of his team, drove furiously forward. So rapidly had the whole scene passed that the inside passengers knew nothing of it, and even those on the top of the coach roused from their stupor and inglorious inaction only to cling desperately to the terribly swaying coach as it thundered down the grade and try to keep their equilibrium. Yet, furious as was their speed, Yuba Bill could not help noticing that the expressman from",

What do you mean?\" clamored the others excitedly. \"Well--THIS is about the spot where the up coach was robbed six months ago,\" returned the messenger. \"Dear me!\" said the lady in the back seat, rising with a half hysterical laugh, \"hadn't we better get out before they come?\" \"There is not the slightest danger, madam,\" said a quiet, observant man, who had scarcely spoken before, \"or the expressman would not have told us; nor would he, I fancy, have left his post beside the treasure on the box.\" The slight sarcasm implied in this was enough to redden the expressman's cheek in the light of the coach lamp which Yuba Bill had just unshipped and brought to the window. He would have made some tart rejoinder, but was prevented by Yuba Bill addressing the passengers: \"Ye'll have to put up with ONE light, I reckon, until we've got this job finished.\" \"How long will it last, Bill?\" asked the man nearest the window. \"Well,\" said Bill, with a contemptuous glance at the elegant coach axe he was carrying in his hand, \"considerin' these purty first-class highly expensive hash choppers that the kempany furnishes us, I reckon it may take an hour.\" \"But is there no place where we can wait?\" asked the lady anxiously. \"I see a light in that house yonder.\" \"Ye might try it, though the kempany, as a rule, ain't in the habit o' makin' social calls there,\" returned Bill, with a certain grim significance. Then, turning to some outside passengers, he added, \"Now, then! them ez is goin' to help me tackle that tree, trot down! I reckon that blitherin' idiot\" (the stranger with the lantern, who had disappeared) \"will have sense enough to fetch us some ropes with his darned axe.\" The passengers thus addressed, apparently miners and workingmen, good humoredly descended, all except one, who seemed disinclined to leave the much coveted seat on the box beside the driver. \"I'll look after your places and keep my own,\" he said, with a laugh, as the others followed",

Only the expressman who seemed to have fallen under the spell of her audacious glances, was uneasy at the license of the others, yet himself dumb towards her. The lady discreetly drew nearer to the fire, the old woman, and her coffee; Hiram subsided into his apathetic attitude by the fire. A shout from the road at last proclaimed the return of Yuba Bill and his helpers. It had the singular effect of startling the party into a vague and uneasy consciousness of indiscretion, as if it had been the voice of the outer world of law and order, and their manner again became constrained. The leave-taking was hurried and perfunctory; the diplomatic Heckshill again lapsed into glittering generalities about \"the best of friends parting.\" Only the expressman lingered for a moment on the doorstep in the light of the fire and the girl's dancing eyes. \"I hope,\" he stammered, with a very youthful blush, \"to come the next time--with--with--a better introduction.\" \"Uncle Harry's,\" she said, with a quick laugh and a mock curtsey, as she turned away. Once out of hearing, the party broke into hurried comment and criticism of the scene they had just witnessed, and particularly of the fair actress who had played so important a part, averring their emphatic intention of wresting the facts from Yuba Bill at once, and cross-examining him closely; but oddly enough, reaching the coach and that redoubted individual, no one seemed to care to take the initiative, and they all scrambled hurriedly to their seats without a word. How far Yuba Bill's irritability and imperious haste contributed to this, or a fear that he might in turn catechise them kept them silent, no one knew. The cynically observant passenger was not there; he and the sole occupant of the box-seat, they were told, had joined the clearing party some moments before, and would be picked up by Yuba Bill later on. Five minutes after Bill had gathered up the reins, they reached the scene of obstruction. The great pine-tree which had fallen from the steep bank above and stretched across the road had been partly lopped of its branches, divided in two lengths, which were now rolled to either side of the track, leaving barely space for the coach to pass. The huge vehicle \"slowed up\" as Yuba Bill skillfully guided his six horses through this narrow alley, whose tassels of pine, glistening with wet, brushed the panels and sides of the coach, and effectually excluded any view from its windows. Seen from the coach top, the horses appeared to be cleaving their way through a dark, shining olive sea, that parted before and closed behind them, as they slowly passed.

The \"inside\" passengers, who had experienced neither the excitement nor the danger of the robbery, yet had been obliged to listen to the hairbreadth escapes of the others, pooh-poohed the whole affair, and even the \"outsides\" themselves were at last convinced that the robbery was a slight one, with little or no loss to the company. The clamor subsided almost as suddenly as it had arisen; the wiser passengers fashioned their attitude on the sang-froid of Yuba Bill, and the whole coach load presently rolled away as complacently as if nothing had happened. II The robbery furnished the usual amount of copy for the local press. There was the inevitable compliment to Yuba Bill for his well-known coolness; the conduct of the young expressman, \"who, though new to the service, displayed an intrepidity that only succumbed to numbers,\" was highly commended, and even the passengers received their meed of praise, not forgetting the lady, \"who accepted the incident with the light-hearted pleasantry characteristic of the Californian woman.\" There was the usual allusion to the necessity of a Vigilance Committee to cope with this \"organized lawlessness\" but it is to be feared that the readers of \"The Red Dog Clarion,\" however ready to lynch a horse thief, were of the opinion that rich stage express companies were quite able to take care of their own property. It was with full cognizance of these facts and their uselessness to him that the next morning Mr. Ned Brice turned from the road where the coach had just halted on the previous night and approached the settler's cabin. If a little less sanguine than he was in Yuba Bill's presence, he was still doggedly inflexible in his design, whatever it might have been, for he had not revealed it even to Yuba Bill. It was his own; it was probably crude and youthful in its directness, but for that reason it was probably more convincing than the vacillations of older counsel. He paused a moment at the closed door, conscious, however, of some hurried movement within which signified that his approach had been observed. The door was opened, and disclosed only the old woman. The same dogged expression was on her face as when he had last seen it, with the addition of querulous expectancy. In reply to his polite \"Good-morning,\" she abruptly faced him with her hands still on the door. \"Ye kin stop right there! Ef yer want ter make any talk about this yar robbery, ye might ez well skedaddle to oncet, for we ain't 'takin' any' to-day!\" \"I have no wish to talk about the robbery,\" said Brice quietly, \"and as far as I can prevent it, you will not be troubled by any questions.

But when he reached the summit he could see that the outline of the street was still plainly marked along the distance by cottages and new suburban villa-like blocks of houses. No. 1101 was in one of these blocks, a small tenement enough, but a palace compared to Mr. Tarbox's Sierran cabin. He impetuously rang the bell, and without waiting to be announced dashed into the little drawing-room and Mr. Tarbox's presence. That had changed too; Mr. Tarbox was arrayed in a suit of clothes as new, as cheaply decorative, as fresh and, apparently, as damp as his own drawing room. \"Did you get my letter? Did you give her the one I inclosed? Why didn't you answer?\" burst out Brice, after his first breathless greeting. Mr. Tarbox's face here changed so suddenly into his old dejected doggedness that Brice could have imagined himself back in the Sierran cabin. The man straightened and bowed himself at Brice's questions, and then replied with bold, deliberate emphasis: \"Yes, I DID get your letter. I DIDN'T give no letter o' yours to her. And I didn't answer your letter BEFORE, for I didn't propose to answer it AT ALL.\" \"Why?\" demanded Brice indignantly. \"I didn't give her your letter because I didn't kalkilate to be any go-between 'twixt you and Snapshot Harry's niece. Look yar, Mr. Brice. Sense I read that 'ar paragraph in that paper you gave me, I allowed to myself that it wasn't the square thing for me to have any more doin's with him, and I quit it. I jest chucked your letter in the fire. I didn't answer you because I reckoned I'd no call to correspond with ye, and when I showed ye that trail over to Harry's camp, it was ended. I've got a house and business to look arter, and it don't jibe with keepin' company with 'road agents.' That's what I got outer that paper you gave me, Mr. Brice.\" Rage and disgust filled Brice at the man's utter selfishness and shameless desertion of his kindred, none the less powerfully that he remembered the part he himself had played in concocting the paragraph. \"Do you mean to say,\" he demanded passionately, \"that for the sake of that foolish paragraph you gave up your own kindred? That you truckled to the mean prejudices of your neighbors and kept that poor, defenseless girl from the only honest roof she could find refuge under? That you dared to destroy my letter to her, and made her believe I was as selfish and ungrateful as yourself?\" \"Young feller,\" said Mr. Tarbox still more deliberately,",
