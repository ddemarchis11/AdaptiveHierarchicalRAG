Oh, sir, thinking as you'd given some of the mixture to Dandy I put your cheerful little offering on to Bonny Betsy. [_SALOME and SHEBA disappear._ THE DEAN. Oh! [_To BLORE._] I could have pardoned everything but this last act of disobedience. You are unworthy of the Deanery. Leave it for some ordinary household. BLORE. If I leave the Deanery, I shall give my reasons, and then what'll folks think of you and me in our old age? THE DEAN. You wouldn't spread this tale in St. Marvells? BLORE. Not if sober, sir--but suppose grief drove me to my cups? THE DEAN. I must save you from intemperance at any cost. Remain in my service--a sad, sober and, above all, a silent man! [_SALOME and SHEBA appear as BLORE goes out through the window._ SALOME. Papa! THE DEAN. To your rooms! I am distracted! SALOME. Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey!---- THE DEAN. If you have sufficiently merged all sense of moral rectitude as to declare that I am not at home, do so. SHEBA. No, no. Papa; we have accidentally discovered that you, our parent, have stooped to deception, if not to crime. THE DEAN. [_Staggering back._] Oh! SHEBA. We are still young--the sooner, therefore, we are removed from any unfortunate influence the better. SALOME. We have an opportunity of beginning life afresh. SHEBA. These two gallant gentlemen have proposed for us. THE DEAN. Then I _am_ at home. Where are they? [_He goes out rapidly, followed by SALOME and SHEBA. Directly they have disappeared, NOAH TOPPING, looking dishevelled, rushes in at the window, with HANNAH clinging to him._ NOAH. [_Glaring round the room._] Is this 'ere the Deanery? [_GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM come to him._ HANNAH. Noahry, Noah, come back! NOAH. Theer's been a man rescued from my lawful custody while my face was unofficially held downwards in the mud. The villain has been traced back to the Deanery. SIR TRISTRAM. Go away! HANNAH. Come away! NOAH. The man was a unknown lover of my nooly made wife! GEORGIANA.

[_Softly to THE DEAN._] Oh Jedd, Jedd--and these are what you call Principles! Have you got the key of your handcuffs? THE DEAN. Yes. NOAH. [_Appearing in the doorway._] Time's oop. Coom on! THE DEAN. May I say a few parting words in the home I have apparently wrecked? NOAH. Say' em and 'a done. THE DEAN. In setting out upon a journey, the termination of which is problematical, I desire to attest that this erring constable is the husband of a wife from whom it is impossible to withhold respect, if not admiration. NOAH. You 'ear' im! THE DEAN. As for my wretched self, the confession of my weaknesses must be reserved for another time--another place. [_To GEORGIANA._] To you, whose privilege it is to shelter in the sanctity of the Deanery, I give this earnest admonition. Within an hour from this terrible moment, let the fire be lighted in the drawing-room--let the missing man's warm bath be waiting for its master--a change of linen prepared. Withhold your judgments. Wait. NOAH. This is none of your business. Coom on. THE DEAN. I am ready! [_NOAH takes him by the arm and leads him out._ GEORGIANA. Oh, what am I to think of my brother? HANNAH. [_Kneeling at GEORGIANA'S feet._] Think! That he's the beautifullest, sweetest man in all Durnshire! GEORGIANA. Woman! HANNAH. It's I and my whistle and Nick the fire-brigade horse what'll bring him back to the Deanery safe and unharmed. Not a soul but we three'll ever know of his misfortune. [_Listening._] Hark! They're off! NOAH. [_Outside._] Get up, now! Get-oop, old girl! HANNAH. [_With a cry._] Ah! [_Rushing to the door and looking out._] He's done for! GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM. Done for! HANNAH. The Dean can whistle himself blue! Noah's put Kitty in the cart, and left Old Nick at home! THE END OF THE FIRST SCENE. _The second scene is the Morning Room at the Deanery again._ _SALOME and SHEBA are sitting there gloomily._ SALOME. Poor Papa! SHEBA. Poor dear",

Go to your room! GEORGIANA. Augustin! THE DEAN. In the morning I will endeavor to frame some verbal expression of the horror with which I regard your proposal. For the present, you are my parents' child and I trust your bed is well aired. GEORGIANA. Oh, very well, Augustin. I've done all I can for the Spire. _Bon soir,_ old boy! THE DEAN. Good-night. GEORGIANA. If you're wiser in the morning just send Blore on to the course and he'll put the money on for you. THE DEAN. Blore! My poor devoted old servant would be lost on a race-course. GEORGIANA. Would he! He was quite at home in Tattersall's Ring when I was at St. Marvells last summer. THE DEAN. Blore! GEORGIANA. Blore. I recognized the veteran sportsman the moment I came into the Deanery. THE DEAN. What was my butler doing at St. Marvells Races? _BLORE enters with his lantern._ GEORGIANA. Investing the savings of your cook and housemaid, of course. You don't think your servants are as narrow as you are! THE DEAN. Oh! BLORE. I beg your pardon, sir, shall I go the rounds, sir?

And pack a hamper with a cold chicken, some French rolls, and two bottles of Heidsieck--label it \"George Tidd,\" and send it on to the Hill. I'll stand the racket. Goodnight. [_She goes out.
