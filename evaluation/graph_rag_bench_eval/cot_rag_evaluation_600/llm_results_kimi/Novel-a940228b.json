  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today was a day of sorrow. My beloved parrot, companion and confidant, was snatched away by envious fate, taken from my side. I said my farewells with heavy heart. In my grief, I called upon Isis, hoping she would turn her features to me and grant comfort. The gods are distant, yet my pain feels as if I am born to be a cause of trouble to my lover.",
  "llm_answer": "Diary of Corinna  \n(undated, the night after the seventh day)\n\nI write by lamplight, my eyes still hot with tears. My little echo, my feathered mimic, is gone. All week I fasted, I sat in Isis’ temple on her appointed days, the Galli twining laurels while I prayed—not for myself this time, but for the small green life that perched on my shoulder and learned every cadence of my voice. I had hoped the Goddess, who keeps the serpent coiled around her altars and lets the horned Apis walk in her train, would turn her face toward us and spare him. I promised her frankincense, white robes, an inscription: “Naso, for the preservation of Corinna’s parrot, offers these.” Yet the seventh dawn arrived, and with it his faltering breath.\n\nHe took only a nut at breakfast, a drop of water at noon; poppies lulled him to sleep each dusk. Today his tongue, always quicker than any bird’s, managed one last sentence—my name, and farewell—before the thread snapped. I laid him in a coffin no larger than his body, set a stone above it: “From this very tomb I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress. I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.”\n\nI imagine him now in the Elysian grove reserved for innocent birds: holm-oak shade, ever-green grass, swans, the Phoenix, Juno’s peacock, and my chatterer among them, calling newcomers with human words. If Isis rules there too, may she let him keep his voice.\n\nI close this page; the lamp flickers like his last heartbeat. Vale, my echo. Corinna.",

With a very little you were satisfied; and, through your love of talking, you could not give time to your mouth for much food. A nut was your food, and poppies the cause of sleep; and a drop of pure water used to dispel your thirst. The gluttonous vulture lives on, the kite, too, that forms its circles in the air, and the jackdaw, the foreboder [364] of the shower of rain. The crow, too, lives on, hateful to the armed Minerva; [366] it, indeed, will hardly die after nine ages. [367] The prattling parrot is dead, the mimic of the human voice, sent as a gift from the ends of the earth. What is best, is generally first carried off by greedy hands; what is worthless, fills its _destined_ numbers. [368] Thersites was the witness of the lamented death of him from Phylax; and now Hector became ashes, while his brothers _yet_ lived. Why should I mention the affectionate prayers of my anxious mistress in your behalf; prayers borne over the seas by the stormy North wind? The seventh day was come, [369] that was doomed to give no morrow; and now stood your Destiny, with her distaff all uncovered. And yet your words did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue cried aloud, \"Corinna, farewell!\" [370] At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green. If there is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole bird _of its kind. There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers; the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate. Received in this home in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his words. [372] A sepulchre covers his bones; a sepulchre small as his body; on which a little stone has _this_ inscription, well suited to itself: \"From this very tomb [377] I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress. I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.\" ELEGY VII. _He attempts to convince his mistress, who suspects the contrary, that he is not in love with her handmaid Cypassis._ |Am I then [378] 'to be for ever made the object of accusation by new",

She, in truth, who incurred so great a risk unknown to me, is worthy of my wrath; but anger falls before apprehension. But yet, by me it was that she conceived; or so I think. That is often as a fact to me, which is possible. Isis, thou who dost [422] inhabit Parætonium, [423] and the genial fields of Canopus, [424] and Memphis, [425] and palm-bearing Pharos, [426] and where the rapid. Nile, discharged from its vast bed, rushes through its seven channels into the ocean waves; by thy 'sistra' [428] do I entreat thee; by the faces, _too_, of revered Anubis; [429] and then may the benignant Osiris [430] ever love thy rites, and may the sluggish serpent [431] ever wreath around thy altars, and may the horned Apis [432] walk in the procession as thy attendant; turn hither thy features, [433] and in one have mercy upon two; for to my mistress wilt thou be giving life, she to me. Full many a time in thy honour has she sat on thy appointed days, [434] on which [435] the throng of the Galli [436] wreathe _themselves_ with thy laurels. [437] Thou, too, who dost have compassion on the females who are in labour, whose latent burden distends their bodies slowly moving; come, propitious Ilithyia, [438] and listen to my prayers. She is worthy for thee to command to become indebted to thee. I, myself, in white array, will offer frankincense at thy smoking altars; I, myself, will offer before thy feet the gifts that I have vowed. I will add _this_ inscription too; \"Naso, for the preservation of Corinna, _offers these_.\" But if, amid apprehensions so great, I may be allowed to give you advice, let it suffice for you, Corinna, to have struggled in this _one_ combat. ELEGY XIV. _He reproaches his mistress for having attempted to procure abortion._ |Of what use is it for damsels to live at ease, exempt from war, and not with their bucklers, [439] to have any inclination to follow the bloodstained troops; if, without warfare, they endure wounds from weapons of their own, and arm their imprudent hands for their own destruction?

'Numeri' means here, the similar. parts of one whole: 'the allotted portions of human life.'] [Footnote 369: Seventh day was come.--Ver. 45. Hippocrates, in his Aphorisms, mentions the seventh, fourteenth, and twentieth, as the critical days in a malady. Ovid may here possibly allude to the seventh day of fasting, which was supposed to terminate the existence of the person so doing.] [Footnote 370: Corinna, farewell.--Ver. 48. It may have said 'Corinna;' but Ovid must excuse us if we decline to believe that it said 'vale,' 'farewell,' also; unless, indeed, it had been in the habit of saying so before; this, perhaps, may have been the case, as it had probably often heard the Poet say 'vale' to his mistress.] [Footnote 371: The Elysian hill.--Ver. 49. He kindly imagines a place for the souls of the birds that are blessed.] [Footnote 372: By his words.--Ver. 58. His calling around him, in human accents, the other birds in the Elysian fields, is ingeniously and beautifully imagined.] [Footnote 377: This very tomb.--Ver. 61. This and the following line are considered by Heinsius to be spurious, and, indeed, the next line hardly looks like the composition of Ovid.] [Footnote 378: Am I then.--Ver. 1. 'Ergo' here is very expressive. 'Am I always then to be made the subject of fresh charges?'] [Footnote 379: Long-eared ass.--Ver. 15. Perhaps the only holiday that the patient ass got throughout the year, was in the month of June, when the festival of Vesta was celebrated, and to which Goddess he had rendered an important service. See the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1. 311, et seq.] [Footnote 380: Skilled at tiring.--Ver. 17. She was the 'ornatrix,' or 'tiring woman' of Corinna.

Macrobius tells us, that the Egyptians accompanied the statue of Serapis with that of an animal with three heads, the middle one that of a lion, the one to the right, of a dog, and that to the left, of a ravenous wolf; and that a serpent was represented encircling it in its folds, with its head below the right hand of the statue of the Deity. To this the Poet possibly alludes, or else to the asp, which was common in the North of Egypt, and perhaps, was looked upon as sacred. If so, it is probable that the word 'pigra,' 'sluggish,' refers to the drowsy effect produced by the sting of the asp, which was generally mortal. This, indeed, seems the more likely, from the fact of the asp being clearly referred to, in company with these Deities, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1. 93; which see, with the Note to the passage.] [Footnote 432: The horned Apis.--Ver. 14.

Votaries who were worshipping in the temples of the Deities sat there for a considerable time, especially when they attended for the purpose of sacrifice.

Come here and be introduced to the family!\" Thus adjured, the crow hopped solemnly forward, and made his best bow to the three inmates, who in turn saluted him, each after his or her fashion. The raccoon was gracious and condescending, the squirrel familiar and friendly, the parrot frigidly polite, though inwardly resenting that a crow should be presented to her,--to _her_, the favorite attendant of the late lamented Princess of Central Africa,--without her permission having been asked first. As for the crow, he stood on one leg and blinked at them all in a manner which meant a great deal or nothing at all, just as you chose to take it. \"Distinguished persons!\" he said, gravely, \"it is with pleasure that I make your acquaintance. May this day be the least happy of your lives! Lady Parrot,\" he added, addressing himself particularly to Miss Mary, \"grant me the honor of leading you within. The evening air is chill for one so delicate and fragile.\" Miss Mary, highly delighted at being addressed by such a stately title as \"Lady Parrot,\" relaxed at once the severity of her mien, and gracefully sidled into the house in company with the sable-clad stranger, while Toto and the two others followed, much amused. After a hearty supper, in the course of which Toto related as much of his and Bruin's adventures in the hermit's cave as he thought proper, the whole family gathered around the blazing hearth. Toto brought the pan of apples and the dish of nuts; the grandmother took up her knitting, and said, with a smile: \"And who will tell us a story, this evening? We have had none for two evenings now, and it is high time that we heard something new. Cracker, my dear, is it not your turn?\" \"I think it is,\" said the squirrel, hastily cramming a couple of very large nuts into his cheek-pouches, \"and if you like, I will tell you a story that Mrs. Cow told me a day or two ago. It is about a cow that jumped over the moon.\" \"What!\" cried Toto. \"Why, I've known that story ever since I was a baby! And it isn't a story, either, it's a rhyme,-- \"Hey diddle diddle, The cat and the fiddle, The cow--\" \"Yes, yes! I know, Toto,\" interrupted the squirrel. \"She told me that, too, and said it was a pack of lies, and that people like you didn't know anything about the real truth of the matter. So now, if you will just listen to me, I will tell you how it really happened.\" THE MOON-CALF. There once was a young cow, and she had a calf. \"And that's half!\"",
