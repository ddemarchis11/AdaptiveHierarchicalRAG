The 'coena' of the Romans is usually translated by the word 'supper'; but as being the chief meal of the day, and being in general, (at least during the Augustan age) taken at about three o'clock, it really corresponds to our 'dinner.'] [Footnote 028: Warm the bosom of another.--Ver. 5. As each guest while reclining on the couch at the entertainment, mostly leaned on his left elbow during the meal, and as two or more persons lay on the same couch, the head of one person reached to the breast of him who lay above him, and the lower person was said to lie on the bosom of the other. Among the Romans, the usual number of persons occupying each couch was three. Sometimes, however, four occupied one couch; while, among the Greeks, only two reclined upon it. In this instance, he describes the lady as occupying the place below her husband, and consequently warming his breast with her head. For a considerable time after the fashion of reclining at meals had been introduced into Rome, the Roman ladies sat at meals while the other sex was recumbent. Indeed, it was generally considered more becoming for females to be seated, especially if it was a party where many persons were present. Juvenal, however, represents a bride as reclining at the marriage supper on the bosom of her husband. On the present occasion, it is not very likely that the ladies were particular about the more rigid rules of etiquette. It must be remembered that before lying down, the shoes or sandals were taken off.] [Footnote 029: Damsel of Atrax.--Ver. 8.

DISTILLING. [Illustration: D]ISTILLING (d[)i]s t[)i]l[\\l]'ing) may be a new word to you, but you can easily learn its meaning. You have all seen distilling going on in the kitchen at home, many a time. When the water in the tea-kettle is boiling, what comes out at the nose? Steam. What is steam? You can find out what it is by catching some of it on a cold plate, or tin cover. As soon as it touches any thing cold, it turns into drops of water. When we boil water and turn it into steam, and then turn the steam back into water, we have distilled the water. We say vapor instead of steam, when we talk about the boiling of alcohol. It takes less heat to turn alcohol to vapor than to turn water to steam; so, if we put over the fire some liquid that contains alcohol, and begin to collect the vapor as it rises, we shall get alcohol first, and then water. But the alcohol will not be pure alcohol; it will be part water, because it is so ready to mix with water that it has to be distilled many times to be pure. But each time it is distilled, it will become stronger, because there is a little more alcohol and a little less water. In this way, brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are distilled, from wine, cider, and the liquors which have been made from corn, rye, or barley. The cider, wine, and beer had but little alcohol in them. The brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are nearly one-half alcohol. A glass of strong liquor which has been made by distilling, will injure any one more, and quicker, than a glass of cider, rum, or beer. But a cider, wine, or beer-drinker often drinks so much more of the weaker",

The most singular characteristic of the instrument is that the performer does not blow into it, but inhales the air through it; or rather, he produces the sound by sucking the mouthpiece. It is said to require strong lungs to perform on the _acocotl_ effectively according to Indian notions of taste. [Illustration] The _botuto_, which Gumilla saw used by some tribes near the river Orinoco (of which we engrave two examples), was evidently an ancient Indian contrivance, but appears to have fallen almost into oblivion during the last two centuries. It was made of baked clay and was commonly from three to four feet long: but some trumpets of this kind were of enormous size. The _botuto_ with two bellies was usually made thicker than that with three bellies and emitted a deeper sound, which is described as having been really terrific. These trumpets were used on occasions of mourning and funeral dances. Alexander von Humboldt saw the _botuto_ among some Indian tribes near the river Orinoco. Besides those which have been noticed, other antique wind instruments of the Indians are mentioned by historians; but the descriptions given of them are too superficial to convey a distinct notion as to their form and purport. Several of these barbarous contrivances scarcely deserve to be classed with musical instruments. This may, for instance, be said of certain musical jars or earthen vessels producing sounds, which the Peruvians constructed for their amusement. These vessels were made double; and the sounds imitated the cries of animals or birds. A similar contrivance of the Indians in Chili, preserved in the museum at Santiago, is described by the traveller S. S. Hill as follows:--“It consists of two earthen vessels in the form of our india-rubber bottles, but somewhat larger, with a flat tube from four to six inches in length, uniting their necks near the top and slightly curved upwards, and with a small hole on the upper side one third of the length of the tube from one side of the necks. To produce the sounds the bottles were filled with water and suspended to the bough of a tree, or to a beam, by a string attached to the middle of the curved tube, and then swung backwards and forwards in such a manner as to cause each end to be alternately the highest and lowest, so that the water might pass backwards and forwards from one bottle to the other through the tube between them. By this means soothing sounds were produced which, it is said, were employed to lull to repose the drowsy chiefs who usually slept away the hottest hours of the day. In the meantime, as the bottles were porous, the water within them diminished by evaporation, and the sound died gradually away.” [Illustration]",

      "text": "say: \"Now, I can not make my grape-jelly, for the grape-juice is spoiled.\" WHAT IS THIS CHANGE IN THE GRAPE-JUICE? The sugar in the grape-juice is changing into something else. It is turning into alcohol and a gas[A] that moves about in little bubbles in the liquid, and rising to the top, goes off into the air. The alcohol is a thin liquid which, mixed with the water, remains in the grape-juice. The sugar is gone; alcohol and the bubbles of gas are left in its place. This alcohol is a liquid poison. A little of it will harm any one who drinks it; much of it would kill the drinker. Ripe grapes are good food; but grape-juice, when its sugar has turned to alcohol, is not a safe drink for any one. It is poisoned by the alcohol. WINE. This changed grape-juice is called wine. It is partly water, partly alcohol, and it still has the grape flavor in it. Wine is also made from currants, elderberries, and other fruits, in very much the same way as from grapes. People sometimes make it at home from the fruits that grow in their own gardens, and think there is no alcohol in it, because they do not put any in. But you know that the alcohol is made in the fruit-juice itself by the change of the sugar into alcohol and the gas. [Illustration] It is the nature of alcohol to make the person who takes a little of it, in wine, or any other drink, want more and more alcohol. When one goes on, thus taking more and more of the drinks that contain alcohol, he is called a drunkard. In this way wine has made many drunkards. Alcohol hurts both the body and mind. It changes the person who drinks it. It will make a good and kind person cruel and bad; and will make a bad person worse. Every one who takes wine does not become a drunkard, but you are not sure that you will not, if you drink it. You should not drink wine, because there is alcohol in it. CIDER. Cider is made from apples. In a few hours after the juice is pressed out of the apples, if it is left open to the air the sugar begins to change. Like the sugar in the grape, it changes into alcohol and bubbles of gas. At first, there is but little alcohol in cider, but a little of this poison is dangerous. More alcohol is all the time forming until in ten cups of cider there may be one cup of alcohol. Cider often makes its drinkers ill-tempered and cross. Cider and wine will turn into vinegar if left in a warm place long enough. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. What two things are in all fruit-juices?",
