Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can not carry their messages correctly. Then the brain can not think well. Alcohol does not strengthen the mind. Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make him useful and happy. Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole. Would you be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a palace, and had a million of dollars? If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not let alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. What things were left out of our bill of fare?           2. How could you measure your strength?           3. How can you gain strength?           4. Why does drinking beer not make you strong?           5. Show why drinking wine or any other alcoholic           drink will not make you strong.           6.

[Illustration: T]HE heart is in the chest, the upper part of the strong box which the ribs, spine, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones make for each of us. It is made of very thick, strong muscles, as you can see by looking at a beef's heart, which is much like a man's, but larger. HOW THE HEART WORKS. Probably some of you have seen a fire-engine throwing a stream of water through a hose upon a burning building. As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped",

If you should measure your strength before and after drinking beer, you would find that you had not gained any. Most of the food part of the grain has been turned into alcohol. CIDER. The juice of crushed apples, you know, is called cider. As soon as the cider begins to turn sour, or \"hard,\" as people say, alcohol begins to form in it. Pure water is good, and apples are good. But the apple-juice begins to be a poison as soon as there is the least drop of alcohol in it. In cider-making, the alcohol forms in the juice, you know, in a few hours after it is pressed out of the apples. None of the drinks in which there is alcohol, can give you real strength. Then why do people think they can? Because alcohol puts the nerves to sleep, they can not, truly, tell the brain how hard the work is, or how heavy the weight to be lifted. The alcohol has in this way cheated men into thinking they can do more than they really can. This false feeling of strength lasts only a little while. When it has passed, men feel weaker than before. A story which shows that alcohol does not give strength, was told me by the captain of a ship, who sailed to China and other distant places. Many years ago, when people thought a little alcohol was good, it was the custom to carry in every ship, a great deal of rum. This liquor is distilled from molasses and contains about one half alcohol. This rum was given to the sailors every day to drink; and, if there was a great storm, and they had very hard work to do, it was the custom to give them twice as much rum as usual. [Illustration] The captain watched his men and saw that they were really made no stronger by drinking the rum; but that, after a little while, they felt weaker. So he determined to go to sea with no rum in his ship. Once out on the ocean, of course the men could not get any. At first, they did not like it; but the captain was very careful to have their food good and plentiful; and, when a storm came, and they were wet and cold and tired, he gave them hot coffee to drink. By the time they had crossed the ocean, the men said: \"The captain is right. We have worked better, and we feel stronger, for going without the rum.\" STRENGTH OF MIND.

      "text": "The little white nerve-threads lie smoothly side by side, making small white cords. Each kind of message goes on its own thread, so that the messages need never get mixed or confused. These nerves are very delicate little messengers. They do all the feeling for the whole body, and by means of them we have many pains and many pleasures. If there was no nerve in your tooth it could not ache. But if there were no nerves in your mouth and tongue, you could not taste your food. If there were no nerves in your hands, you might cut them and feel no pain. But you could not feel your mother's soft, warm hand, as she laid it on yours. One of your first duties is the care of yourselves. Children may say: \"My father and mother take care of me.\" But even while you are young, there are some ways in which no one can take care of you but yourselves. The older you grow, the more this care will belong to you, and to no one else. Think of the work all the parts of the body do for us, and how they help us to be well and happy. Certainly the least we can do is to take care of them and keep them in good order. CARE OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES. As one part of the brain has to take care of all the rest of the body, and keep every organ at work, of course it can never go to sleep itself. If it did, the heart would stop pumping, the lungs would leave off breathing, all other work would stop, and the body would be dead. But there is another part of the brain which does the thinking, and this part needs rest. When you are asleep, you are not thinking, but you are breathing and other work of the body is going on. If the thinking part of the brain does not have good quiet sleep, it will soon wear out. A worn-out brain is not easy to repair. If well cared for, your brain will do the best of work for you for seventy or eighty years without complaining. The nerves are easily tired out, and they need much rest. They get tired if we do one thing too long at a time; they are rested by a change of work. IS ALCOHOL GOOD FOR THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN? Think of the wonderful work the brain is all the time doing for you! You ought to give it the best of food to keep it in good working order. Any drink that contains alcohol is not a food to make one strong; but is a poison to hurt, and at last to kill. It injures the brain and nerves so that they can not work well, and send their messages properly. That is why the drunkard does not know what he is about. Newspapers often tell us about people setting houses on fire; about men who forgot to turn the switch, and so wrecked a railroad train; about men",

Newspapers often tell us about people setting houses on fire; about men who forgot to turn the switch, and so wrecked a railroad train; about men who lay down on the railroad track and were run over by the cars. Often these stories end with: \"The person had been drinking.\" When the nerves are put to sleep by alcohol, people become careless and do not do their work faithfully; sometimes, they can not even tell the difference between a railroad track and a place of safety. The brain receives no message, or the wrong one, and the person does not know what he is doing. You may say that all men who drink liquor do not do such terrible things. That is true. A little alcohol is not so bad as a great deal. But even a little makes the head ache, and hurts the brain and nerves. A body kept pure and strong is of great service to its owner. There are people who are not drunkards, but who often drink a little liquor. By this means, they slowly poison their bodies. When sickness comes upon them, they are less able to bear it, and less likely to get well again, than those who have never injured their bodies with alcohol. When a sick or wounded man is brought into the hospital, one of the first questions asked him by the doctor is: \"Do you drink?\" If he answers \"Yes!\" the next questions are, \"What do you drink?\" and \"How much?\" The answers he gives to these questions, show the doctor what chance the man has of getting well. A man who never drinks liquor will get well, where a drinking man would surely die. TOBACCO AND THE NERVES. Why does any one wish to use tobacco? Because many men say that it helps them, and makes them feel better. Shall I tell you how it makes them feel better? If a man is cold, the tobacco deadens his nerves so that he does not feel the cold and does not take pains to make himself warmer. If a man is tired, or in trouble, tobacco will not really rest him or help him out of his trouble. It only puts his nerves to sleep and helps him think that he is not tired, and that he does not need to overcome his troubles. It puts his nerves to sleep very much as alcohol does, and helps him to be contented with what ought not to content him. A boy who smokes or chews tobacco, is not so good a scholar as if he did not use the poison. He can not remember his lessons so well. Usually, too, he is not so polite, nor so good a boy as he otherwise would be. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. How do the muscles know when to move?",

      "text": "scheme which Riedel had proposed.[59] This general project having failed, Wieland may have cherished the purpose of defending Tristram independently of the plan. Or this may be a reviewer’s vague memory of a former rumor of plan. It is worth noting incidentally that Gellert does not seem to have known Sterne at all. His letters, for example, to Demoiselle Lucius, which begin October 22, 1760, and continue to December 4, 1769, contain frequent references to other English celebrities, but none to Sterne. The first notice of Sterne’s death is probably that in the _Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_ of Hamburg in the issue of April 6, 1768, not three weeks after the event itself. The brief announcement is a comparison with Cervantes. The _Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen_ chronicles the death of Yorick, August 29, 1768.[60] Though published in England from 1759-67, Tristram Shandy seems not to have been reprinted in Germany till the 1772 edition of Richter in Altenburg, a year later indeed than Richter’s reprint of the Sentimental Journey. The colorless and inaccurate Zückert translation, as has already been suggested, achieved no real popular success and won no learned recognition. The reviews were largely silent or indifferent to it, and, apart from the comparatively few notices already cited, it was not mentioned by any important literary periodical until after its republication by Lange, when the Sentimental Journey had set all tongues awag with reference to the late lamented Yorick. None of the journals indicate any appreciation of Sterne’s especial claim to recognition, nor see in the fatherland any peculiar receptiveness to his appeal. In short, the foregoing accumulation of particulars resolves itself into the general statement, easily derived from the facts stated: Sterne’s position in the German world of letters is due primarily to the Sentimental Journey. Without its added impulse Shandy would have hardly stirred the surface of German life and thought. The enthusiasm even of a few scholars whose learning and appreciation of literature is international, the occasional message of uncertain understanding, of doubtful approbation, or of rumored popularity in another land, are not sufficient to secure a general interest and attentiveness, much less a literary following. The striking contrast between the essential characteristics of the two books is a sufficient and wholly reasonable occasion for Germany’s temporary indifference to the one and her immediate welcome for the other. Shandy is whimsicality touched with sentiment. The Sentimental Journey is the record of a sentimental experience, guided by the caprice of a whimsical will. Whimsicality is a flower that defies transplanting; when once rooted in other soil it shoots up into obscurity, masquerading as profundity,",
