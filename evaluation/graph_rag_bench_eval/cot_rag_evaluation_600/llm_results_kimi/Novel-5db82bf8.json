He was foreman of the Daily Minnesotian office and he usually went by the name of \"Johnny Martin.\" Now Johnny always kept his fire paraphernalia close at hand, and every time a fire bell sounded he was \"Johnny on the spot.\" After the fire was over Johnny generally had to celebrate, and every time Johnny celebrated he would make a solemn declaration that it was his duty to kill an Irishman before he returned to work. He would accordingly provide himself with an immense Derringer and start out in quest of a subject upon whom he proposed to execute his sanguinary threat. Strange to relate he never succeeded in finding one of his unfortunate countrymen, and it generally required two or three days to restore him to his former equilibrium. If Johnny was a member of the fire department to-day he would probably discover that the task of finding one of his countrymen would not be so difficult. In 1857 Hope Engine Company No. 1 was organized, and they petitioned the common council to purchase 500 feet of hose for their use. In the fall of 1858 this company was given possession of one of the new engines recently purchased and it was comfortably housed at their headquarters in an old frame building on the southwest corner of Franklin and Fourth streets, and in a short time removed to a new brick building on Third street, fronting on Washington. Michael Leroy was made the first foreman and R.C. Wiley and Joseph S. Herey were his assistants. The membership contained the names of John H. Dodge, Porteus Dodge, John E. Missen, Joseph Elfelt, Fred Whipperman, John T. Toal, J.H. Barstow, J.C. Grand, Charles Riehl, John Raguet, E. Rhodes, B. Bradley, Charles Hughes, Bird Boesch, T.F. Masterson, John J. Williams and V. Metzger. During the fall of 1858 a large number of the most prominent business men in the vicinity of Seven Corners joined the organization and continued in active membership until the arrival of the first steamer. In the winter of 1857-1858 Minnehaha Engine. Company No. 2 was organized, and it was provided with an engine house near the corner of Third and Jackson streets. The first officers were H.P. Grant, foreman; M.J. O'Connor and H.B. Terwilliger, assistants; members, Harry M. Shaw, Nicholas Hendy, John B. Oliver, F.A. Cariveau, H.A. Schlick. C.D. Hadway, N. Nicuhaus, L.R. Storing, William T. Donaldson, Daniel Rohrer, J. Fletcher",

Fletcher Williams, N. W. Kittson, Alfred Bayace, John McCauley and a number of others. The Minnehahas were a prosperous organization from the first, and their engine house was always kept open and served as a general lounging and reading-room for such of its members as had nothing particular to do. Rotary Independent Company No. 1 was the third engine connected with the St. Paul fire department, but that was a private institution and was only used when there was a general alarm and on the days of the annual parade of the department. This engine was purchased from the government by John S. Prince when Fort Snelling was abandoned, and was used for the protection of the property of the mill, which was located on lower Third street. By the formation of Minnehaha Engine company the city fathers thought they were possessed of quite a respectable fire department, and from that time on the annual parade of the St. Paul fire department was one of the events of the year. The first parade occurred on the 12th of September, 1859, and was participated in by the following organizations:   Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No. 1.   Hope Engine Company No. 1.   Minnehaha Engine Company No. 2.   Rotary Independent Company No. 1. These four companies numbered 175 men, and after completing their line of march were reviewed by the mayor and common council in front of the old city hall. In 1858 the legislature passed an act requiring the sextons of the different churches to ring the church bells fifteen minutes whenever there was an alarm of fire. The uptown churches would ring their bells, the downtown churches would ring their bells, and the churches in the central part of the city would ring their bells. There was a regular banging and clanging of the bells.   \"In the startled air of night,   They would scream out their afright,   Too much horrified to speak,   They could only shriek, shriek,   Out of tune.\" Every one turned out when the fire bells rang. Unless the fire was of sufficient volume to be readily located, the uptown people would be seen rushing downtown, and the downtown people would be seen rushing uptown, in fact, general pandemonium prevailed until the exact location of the fire could be determined. Whenever there was a large fire the regular firemen would soon tire of working on the brakes and they would appeal to the spectators to relieve them for a short time. As a general thing the appeal would be readily responded to, but occasionally it would be necessary for the police to impress",

As compensation for their services they were excused from jury duty, poll tax, work on the roads, or state military service, for the period of five years. The original constitution of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company contained the following membership roll: Foreman, Isaac A. Banker; assistant foremen, H.B. Pearson and George F. Blake; treasurer, Richard Galloway; secretary, Robert Mason; members, Henry Buell, John W. Cathcart, Charles D. Elfelt, Edward Heenan, Thompson Ritchie, Philip Ross, Wash. M. Stees, J.W. Stevenson, Benjamin F. Irvine, R.I. Thomson, John McCloud, J.Q.A. Ward, Charles J. Williams. Of the above John McCloud is the only one living in the city at the present time. Mr. McCloud was a member of the firm of McCloud & Bro., hardware dealers, and they occupied the building on the southwest corner of Third and Cedar streets. This was the first full-fledged fire organization in the city, and as Mr. McCloud took the initiative in forming this company he may justly be called the \"Father of the Volunteer Fire Department of St. Paul.\" The old hook and ladder company was one of the representative institutions of the city. From the date of its organization up to the time of the establishment of the paid fire department many of the most prominent men of the city were enrolled among its members. All of the property of the company was owned by the organization, but in 1856, having become somewhat financially embarrassed, their accounts were turned over to the city and they were thereafter under the control of the city fathers. At that time they possessed one truck, hooks and ladders, and one fire engine with hose. Washington M. Stees was made chief engineer and Charles H. Williams assistant. This scanty equipment did not prove adequate for extinguishing fires and petitions were circulated requesting the council to purchase two fire engines of the more approved pattern, and also to construct a number of cisterns in the central part of the city, so that an adequate supply of water could be readily obtained. The city fathers concluded to comply with the request of the petitioners and they accordingly purchased two double-deck hand fire engines and they arrived in the city in August, 1858. They were soon tested and pronounced satisfactory. Our citizens then congratulated themselves upon the possession of a first-class fire department and they predicted that thereafter a great fire would be a thing of the past.

Sibley and other officers on the frontier, the ladies of St. Paul early organized for the purpose of furnishing sick and wounded soldiers with such supplies as were not obtainable through the regular channels of the then crude condition of the various hospitals. Notices like the following often appeared in the daily papers at that time: \"Ladies Aid Society--A meeting of the ladies' aid society for the purpose of sewing for the relief of the wounded soldiers at our forts, and also for the assistance of the destitute refugees now thronging our city, is called to meet this morning at Ingersoll hall. All ladies interested in this object are earnestly invited to attend. All contributions of either money or clothing will be thankfully received. By order of the president, \"Mrs. Stella Selby. \"Miss M.O. Holyoke, Secretary.\" Mrs. Selby was the wife of John W. Selby, one of the first residents of the city, Miss Holyoke was the Clara Barton of Minnesota, devoting her whole time and energy to the work of collecting sanitary supplies for the needy soldiers in the hospitals. Scores of poor soldiers who were languishing in hospital tents on the sunburnt and treeless prairies of the Dakotas, or suffering from disease contracted in the miasmatic swamps of the rebellious South have had their hearts gladdened and their bodies strengthened by being supplied with the delicacies collected through the efforts of the noble and patriotic ladies of this and kindred organizations throughout the state. Many instances are recorded of farmers leaving their harvesters in the field and joining the grand army then forming for the defense of the imperilled state and nation, while their courageous and energetic wives have gone to the fields and finished harvesting the ripened crops. By reason of the outbreak the Sioux forfeited to the government, in addition to an annual annuity of $68,000 for fifty years, all the lands they held in Minnesota, amounting in the aggregate to about 750,000 acres, worth at the present time something like $15,000,000. Had they behaved themselves and remained In possession of this immense tract of land, they would have been worth twice as much per capita as any community in the United States.

Mrs. Presley's death was deeply regretted, not only by the fire department, but by every resident of the city. Among the many brilliant members of the legal fraternity in St. Paul in early times no one possessed a more enviable reputation than the Hon. Michael E. Ames. He was the very personification of punctiliousness and always displayed sublime imperturbability in exigencies of great moment. One dreary winter night his sleeping apartment in uppertown was discovered to be on fire, and in a short time the fire laddies appeared in front of his quarters and commenced operations. As soon as Mr. Ames discovered the nature of the disturbance he arose from his bed, opened the window, and with outstretched arms and in a supplicating manner, as if addressing a jury in an important case, exclaimed: \"Gentlemen, if you will be kind enough to desist from operations until I arrange my toilet, I will be down.\" The learned counsel escaped with his toilet properly adjusted, but his apartments were soon incinerated.
