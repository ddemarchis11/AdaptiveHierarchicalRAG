A company had already been sent out, under the auspices of the Court management, to perform \"Dandy Dick\" in the provinces; but, when the play was withdrawn from the London boards, Mr. Clayton set out himself with a company, and it was during this tour that he died at Liverpool. In America Mr. Daly produced \"Dandy Dick\" with Miss Ada Rehan in Mrs. John Wood's part, but no very great success was achieved; whereas in Australia its reception was so enthusiastic that it ran for quite an unusual time both in Melbourne and Sydney. In the character of the Dean, Mr. G. W. Anson achieved perhaps the greatest of his Australian successes, and Mr. Robert Brough made his mark as the policeman. MALCOLM C. SALAMAK. _December_, 1892. DANDY DICK. THE FIRST ACT. _The morning-room in the Deanery of St. Marvells, with a large arched opening leading to the library on the right, and a deeply-recessed window opening out to the garden on the left. It is a bright spring morning, and an air of comfort and serenity pervades the place._ _SALOME, a tall, handsome, dark girl, of about three-and-twenty, is sitting with her elbows resting on her knees, staring wildly into vacancy. SHEBA, a fair little girl of about seventeen, wearing short petticoats, shares her despondency, and lies prostrate upon the settee._ SALOME. Oh! oh my! oh my! oh my! SHEBA. [_Sitting upright._] Oh, my gracious goodness, goodness gracious me! [_They both walk about excitedly._ SALOME. There's only one terrible word for it--it's a fix! SHEBA. It's worse than that! It's a scrape! How did you ever get led into it? SALOME. How did _we_ get led into it? Halves, Sheba, please. SHEBA. It was Major Tarver's proposal, and I believe, Salome, that it is to _you_ Major Tarver is paying attention. SALOME. The Fancy Dress Masked Ball at Durnstone is promoted by the Officers of the Hussars. I believe that the young gentleman you have impressed calls himself an officer, though he is merely a lieutenant. SHEBA. [_Indignantly._] Mr. Darbey is _certainly_ an officer--a small officer. How dare you gird at me, Salome? SALOME. Very well, then. When to-night we appear at the Durnstone Athenaeum, unknown to dear Papa, on the arms of Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey, I consider that we shall be equally wicked. Oh, how can we be so wrong? SHEBA. Well, we're not wrong",

I haven't, any more than you have, Sheba. SHEBA. Well, I'm in debt too, but I only meant to beg for Salome; but now I ask for both of us. Oh, Aunt Tidman, papa has told us that you have known troubles. GEORGIANA. So I have--heaps of them. SHEBA. Oh, I'm so glad. Because Salome and I are weary fragments too--we're everything awful but chastened widows. We owe forty pounds unknown to Pa! SALOME. Forty pounds, nineteen. GEORGIANA. Why, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves, you girls! SHEBA. We are! SALOME. We are! GEORGIANA. To cry and go on like this about forty pounds! SHEBA. But we've only got fifteen and threepence of our own in the world! And, oh, Aunt, you know something about the Races, don't you? GEORGIANA. Eh? SHEBA. If you do, help two poor creatures to win forty pounds, nineteen. Aunt Georgiana, what's \"Dandy Dick\" you were talking to that gentleman about? GEORGIANA. Child! Dandy Dick's a horse. SHEBA. We thought so. Then let Dandy Dick win _us_ some money. GEORGIANA. No, no! I won't hear of it! SHEBA. Oh, do, do! SALOME. Oh, do, do, do! GEORGIANA. Go away--I won't. I say decidedly, I will not! SHEBA. Oh, do, do! SALOME. Do! Do, and we'll love you for ever and ever, Aunt Georgiana. GEORGIANA. You will! [_She embraces them heartily._] Bless your little innocent faces! Do you want to win forty pounds? SALOME _and_ SHEBA. Yes, yes! GEORGIANA. Do you want to win _fifty_ pounds? SHEBA and SALOME. Oh, yes, yes! GEORGIANA.
