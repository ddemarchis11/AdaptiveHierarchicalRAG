  "question": "How does the narrative reveal the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters, specifically through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname George Tidd and Augustin's role as the Dean, and what impact does this have on the unfolding of their personal and social identities?",
  "gold_answer": "Georgiana Tidman uses the nickname George Tidd, and Augustin is also known as the Dean, showing the use of alternate identities among the characters.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative explicitly foregrounds the use of nicknames and alternate identities through Georgiana Tidman’s self-identification as “George Tidd,” her former racing name, and through Augustin’s formal role as “the Dean.” Georgiana directly states, “I am George Tidd—that was my racing name. Ask after George Tidd at Newmarket—they’ll tell you all about me.” This nickname functions as a distinct identity tied to her past in horse racing, complete with its own social currency and reputation, as evidenced by Sir Tristram Mardon’s recognition and delight upon encountering “Mr. Tidd.” The use of this nickname allows Georgiana to navigate between her past and present selves, asserting agency and continuity in her personal identity despite the Dean’s attempts to reframe her within the decorous confines of the Deanery. Conversely, Augustin is consistently referred to as “the Dean,” a title that encapsulates his social identity and the expectations of sobriety and propriety attached to his clerical position. The tension between these identities—Georgiana’s self-asserted “George Tidd” and Augustin’s institutional “Dean”—drives much of the interpersonal conflict, as Georgiana’s refusal to fully relinquish her past identity challenges Augustin’s authority and the Deanery’s moral atmosphere. The impact is a destabilization of fixed social roles, revealing how personal identities can resist and reshape imposed social identities.",

I am George Tidd--that was my racing name. Ask after George Tidd at Newmarket--they'll tell you all about me. My colors were crimson and black diamonds. There you are.

[_She stalks out, accompanied by the girls._ THE DEAN. My sister, Georgiana--my widowed sister, Georgiana. Dear me, I am quite disturbed. Surely, surely the serene atmosphere of the Deanery will work a change. It must! It must! If not, what a grave mistake I have made. Good gracious! No, no, I won't think of it! Still, it is a little unfortunate that poor Georgiana should arrive here on the very eve of these terrible races at St. Marvells. _BLORE enters with a card._ THE DEAN. Who is it, Blore?
