Mrs. Presley's death was deeply regretted, not only by the fire department, but by every resident of the city. Among the many brilliant members of the legal fraternity in St. Paul in early times no one possessed a more enviable reputation than the Hon. Michael E. Ames. He was the very personification of punctiliousness and always displayed sublime imperturbability in exigencies of great moment. One dreary winter night his sleeping apartment in uppertown was discovered to be on fire, and in a short time the fire laddies appeared in front of his quarters and commenced operations. As soon as Mr. Ames discovered the nature of the disturbance he arose from his bed, opened the window, and with outstretched arms and in a supplicating manner, as if addressing a jury in an important case, exclaimed: \"Gentlemen, if you will be kind enough to desist from operations until I arrange my toilet, I will be down.\" The learned counsel escaped with his toilet properly adjusted, but his apartments were soon incinerated.

It will make you feel exactly as if you were dead and buried.\" That not being the prominent object of our tour in Cornwall, we thanked him again, but as soon as he left the carriage determined among ourselves to take no further steps about visiting Gerrans. [Illustration: VIEW OF FLUSHING FROM THE GREEN BANK HOTEL, FALMOUTH.] However, in spite of the urgency of another fellow-traveller--it is always good to hear everybody's advice, and follow your own--we carried our love of quietness so far that we eschewed the magnificent new Falmouth Hotel, with its _table d'hote_, lawn tennis ground, sea baths and promenade, for the old-fashioned Green Bank, which though it had no green banks, boasted, we had been told, a pleasant little sea view and bay view, and was a resting-place full of comfort and homely peace. Which we found true, and would have liked to stay longer in its pleasant shelter, which almost conquered our horror of hotels; but we had now fairly weighed anchor and must sail on. \"You ought to go at once to the Lizard,\" said the friend who met us, and did everything for us at Falmouth--and the remembrance of whom, and of all that happened in our brief stay, will make the very name of the place sound sweet in our ears for ever. \"The Lizard is the real point for sightseers, almost better than the Land's End. Let us see if we can hear of lodgings.\" She made inquiries, and within half an hour we did hear of some most satisfactory ones. \"The very thing! We will telegraph at once--answer paid,\" said this good genius of practicality, as sitting in her carriage she herself wrote the telegram and despatched it. Telegrams to the Lizard! We were not then at the Ultima Thule of civilisation. \"Still,\" she said, \"you had better provide yourself with some food, such as groceries and hams. You can't always get what you want at the Lizard.\" So, having the very dimmest idea what the Lizard was--whether a town, a village, or a bare rock--when we had secured the desired lodgings (\"quite ideal lodgings,\" remarked our guardian angel), I proceeded to lay in a store of provisions, doing it as carefully as if fitting out a ship for the North Pole--and afterwards found out it was a work of supererogation entirely. The next thing to secure was an \"ideal\" carriage, horse, and man, which our good genius also succeeded in providing. And now, our minds being at rest, we were able to write home a fixed address for a week, and assure our expectant and anxious friends that all was going well with us. Then, after a",

Mr. Carpenter's dream of millions were far from being realized, and when on the 26th of January, 1879, the hotel was burned to the ground, it had for some time previous passed beyond his control. At one time there were three flourishing hotels on Bench street. The average citizen of to-day does not know that such a street ever existed. The Central house, on the corner of Bench and Minnesota streets, was the first hotel of any pretension built in the city, and it was one of the last to be burned. The first session of the territorial legislature of Minnesota was held in the dining room of this old hotel building, and for a number of years the hotel did a thriving business. As the city grew it was made over into a large boarding house, and before the war Mrs. Corbett was manager of the place. It was afterward kept by Mrs. Ferguson, George Pulford and Ben Ferris, the latter being in possession of it when it was destroyed by fire. The building was burned In August, 1873. A hotel that was very popular for some time was the Greenman house, situated on the corner of Fifth and St. Peter streets, the site of the Windsor hotel. It was a three-story frame structure and was built in the early seventies. Mr. Greenman kept the hotel for some time, and then sold it to John Summers, who was the owner of it when it was burned. The Merchants is the only one of the old hotels still existing, and that only in name, as the original structure was torn down to make room for the present building many years ago. Aside from the hotel fires one of the most appalling calamities that ever occurred at a fire in St. Paul took place in May, 1870, when the old Concert Hall building on Third street, near Market, was destroyed. Concert Hall was built by the late J.W. McClung in 1857, and the hall in the basement was one of the largest in the city. The building was three stories high in front and six or seven on the river side. It was located about twenty-five feet back from the sidewalk. Under the sidewalk all kinds of inflamable material was stored and it was from here that the fire was first noticed. In an incredibly short time flames reached the top of the building, thus making escape almost impossible. On the river side of the building on the top floor two brothers, Charles and August Mueller, had a tailor shop. The fire spread so rapidly that the building was completely enveloped in flames before they even thought their lives were endangered. In front of them was a seething mass of flames and the distance to the ground on the river side was so great that a leap from the window meant almost certain",

      "text": "lined the north and south sides of Third street above Jackson, only three buildings were left standing, two being stone structures occupied by Beaumont & Gordon and Bidwell & Co., and the other a four-story brick building owned and occupied by A.L. Larpenteur. The New England, a two-story log house, and one of the first hotels built in St. Paul was among the ruins. The New England was a feature in St. Paul, and it was pointed out to newcomers as the first gubernatorial mansion, and in which Gov. and Mrs. Ramsey had begun housekeeping in 1849. The Empire saloon was another historic ruin, for in its main portion the first printing office of the territory had long held forth, and from it was issued the first Pioneer, April 10, 1849. The Hotel to the Wild Hunter was also destroyed at this fire. In the fall of 1862 the Winslow house, located at Seven Corners, was entirely destroyed by fire. A defective stovepipe in the cupola caused the fire, and it spread so rapidly that it was beyond the control of the firemen when they arrived upon the scene. A few pieces of furniture, badly damaged, was all that was saved of this once popular hotel. The Winslow was a four-story brick building, and with the exception of the Fuller house the largest hotel in the city. The hotel was constructed in 1854 by the late J.M. Winslow. Mr. Winslow was one of the most ingenious hotel constructors in the West. In some peculiar manner he was enabled to commence the construction of a building without any capital, but when the building was completed he not only had the building, but a bank account that indicated that he was a financier as well as a builder. The proprietors of the Winslow were arrested for incendarism, but after a preliminary examination were discharged. The American house, on the corner of Third and Exchange streets, was one of the landmarks of the city for a good many years. It was built in 1849, and the territorial politicians generally selected this hotel as their headquarters. Although it was of very peculiar architecture, the interior fittings were of a modern character. On a stormy night in the month of December, 1863, an alarm of fire was sent in from this hotel, but before the fire department reached the locality the fire was beyond their control. The weather was bitter cold, and the water would be frozen almost as soon as it left the hose. Finding their efforts fruitless to save the building, the firemen turned their attention to saving the guests. There were some very narrow escapes, but no accidents of a very serious nature. As usual, thieves were present and succeeded in carrying off a large amount of jewelry and wearing apparel belonging to the guests. In the year of 1856 Mackubin & Edgerton erected a fine three-story brick building on the corner of Third and",

Not in a frantic rushing about from place to place, glancing at everything and observing nothing; flying from town to town, from hotel to hotel, eager to \"do\" and to see a country, in order that when they get home they may say they have done it, and seen it. Only to say;--as for any real vision of eye, heart, and brain, they might as well go through the world blindfold. It is not the things we see, but the mind we see them with, which makes the real interest of travelling. \"Eyes and No Eyes,\"--an old-fashioned story about two little children taking a walk; one seeing everything, and enjoying everything, and the other seeing nothing, and thinking the expedition the dullest imaginable. This simple tale, which the present generation has probably never read, contains the essence of all rational travelling. So when, as the \"old hen,\" (which I am sometimes called, from my habit of going about with a brood of \"chickens,\" my own or other people's) I planned a brief tour with two of them, one just entered upon her teens, the other in her twenties, I premised that it must be a tour after my own heart. \"In the first place, my children, you must obey orders implicitly. I shall collect opinions, and do my best to please everybody; but in travelling one only must decide, the others coincide. It will save them a world of trouble, and their 'conductor' also; who, if competent to be trusted at all, should be trusted absolutely. Secondly, take as little luggage as possible. No sensible people travel with their point-lace and diamonds. Two 'changes of raiment,' good, useful dresses, prudent boots, shawls, and waterproofs--these I shall insist upon, and nothing more. Nothing for show, as I shall take you to no place where you can show off. We will avoid all huge hotels, all fashionable towns; we will study life in its simplicity, and make ourselves happy",
