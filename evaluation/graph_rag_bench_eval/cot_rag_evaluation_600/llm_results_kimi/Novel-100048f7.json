How odd! You know your brother and I were at Oxford together, George? GEORGIANA. Were you, Tris! Then are you putting up here? SIR TRISTRAM. He won't have me. GEORGIANA. Won't have you! SIR TRISTRAM. Because I'm down here racing. You see, he's a Dean. GEORGIANA. Is he? Well, then, you just lay a thousand sovereigns to a gooseberry that in this house I'm a Dean, too! SIR TRISTRAM. I suppose he's thinking of the Canons--and the Bishop--and those chaps. GEORGIANA. Lord bless your heart, they're all right when you cheer them up a bit! If I'm here till the autumn meeting you'll find me lunching on the hill, with the Canons marking my card and the dear old Bishop mixing the salad. So say the word, Tris--I'll make it all right with Augustin. SIR TRISTRAM. No, thanks, old fellow. The fact is I'm fixed at the \"Swan\" with--what do you think, George?--with Dandy Dick. GEORGIANA. Oh! my old Dandy! SIR TRISTRAM. I brought him down with me in lavender. You know he runs for the Durnstone Handicap to-morrow. GEORGIANA. Know! There's precious little that horse does that I don't know, and what I don't know I dream. Is he fit? SIR TRISTRAM. As a fiddle--shines like a mirror--not an ounce too much or too little. He'll romp in! GEORGIANA. He'll dance in! Tris Mardon! SIR TRISTRAM. Eh? GEORGIANA. [_Mysteriously._] Tris, Dandy Dick doesn't belong to you--not _all_ of him. SIR TRISTRAM. No--I've only a half share. At your sale he was knocked down to John Fielder the trainer. The other half belongs to John. GEORGIANA. No, it doesn't, it belongs to _me!_ SIR TRISTRAM. George! GEORGIANA. Yes, directly I saw Dandy Dick marched out before the auctioneer I asked John Fielder to help me, and he did, like a Briton. For I can't live without horseflesh, if it's only a piece of cat's meat on a skewer. But when I condescended to keep company with the Canons",
