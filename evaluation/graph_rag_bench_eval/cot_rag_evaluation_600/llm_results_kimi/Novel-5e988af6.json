Oh, sir, stop him, stop him!\" she cried. \"Take him away.\" \"Do you hear me!\" cried the Plunger, excited to a degree of utter self-forgetfulness, and carried beyond himself; \"you've got to come with me.\" \"Take away your hand,\" whispered the young Frenchman, fiercely. \"See, I shall win it all; in one grand _coup_ I shall win it all. I shall win five years' pay in one moment.\" He swept all of the money forward on the red and threw himself over the table to see the wheel. \"Wait, confound you!\" whispered the Plunger, excitedly. \"If you will risk it, risk it with some reason. You can't play all that money; they won't take it. Six thousand francs is the limit, unless,\" he ran on quickly, \"you divide the 12,000 francs among the three of us. You understand, 6,000 francs is all that any one person can play; but if you give 4,000 to me, and 4,000 to your wife, and keep 4,000 yourself, we can each chance it. You can back the red if you like, your wife shall put her money on the numbers coming up below eighteen, and I will back the odd. In that way you stand to win 24,000 francs if our combination wins, and you lose less than if you simply back the color. Do you understand?\" \"No!\" cried the Frenchman, reaching for the piles of money which the Plunger had divided rapidly into three parts, \"on the red; all on the red!\" \"Good heavens, man!\" cried the Plunger, bitterly. \"I may not know much, but you should allow me to understand this dirty business.\" He caught the Frenchman by the wrists, and the young man, more impressed with the strange look in the boy's face than by his physical force, stood still, while the ball rolled and rolled, and clicked merrily, and stopped, and balanced, and then settled into the \"seven.\" \"Red, odd, and below,\" the croupier droned mechanically. \"Ah! you see; what did I tell you?\" said the Plunger, with sudden calmness. \"You have won more than your 20,000 francs; you are proprietors--I congratulate you!\" \"Ah, my God!\" cried the Frenchman, in a frenzy of delight, \"I will double it.\" He reached toward the fresh piles of coin as if he meant to sweep them back again, but the Plunger put himself in his way and with a quick movement caught up the rolls of money and dropped them into the skirt of the woman, which she raised like an",

He handed the woman into a carriage at the door, shoved her husband in beside her, and while the man drove to the address she gave him, he told the Frenchman, with an air of a chief of police, that he must leave Monte Carlo at once, that very night. \"Do you suppose I don't know?\" he said. \"Do you fancy I speak without knowledge? I've seen them come here rich and go away paupers. But you shall not; you shall keep what you have and spite them.\" He sent the woman up to her room to pack while he expostulated with and browbeat the excited bridegroom in the carriage. When she returned with the bag packed, and so heavy with the gold that the servants could hardly lift it up beside the driver, he ordered the coachman to go down the hill to the station. \"The train for Paris leaves at midnight,\" he said, \"and you will be there by morning. Then you must close your bargain with this old Carbut, and never return here again.\" The Frenchman had turned during the ride from an angry, indignant prisoner to a joyful madman, and was now tearfully and effusively humble in his petitions for pardon and in his thanks. Their benefactor, as they were pleased to call him, hurried them into the waiting train and ran to purchase their tickets for them. \"Now,\" he said, as the guard locked the door of the compartment, \"you are alone, and no one can get in, and you cannot get out. Go back to your home, to your new home, and never come to this wretched place again. Promise me--you understand?--never again!\" They promised with effusive reiteration. They embraced each other like children, and the man, pulling off his hat, called upon the good Lord to thank the gentleman. \"You will be in Paris, will you not?\" said the woman, in an ecstasy of pleasure, \"and you will come to see us in our own shop, will you not? Ah! we should be so greatly honored, sir, if you would visit us; if you would come to the home you have given us. You have helped us so greatly, sir,\" she said; \"and may Heaven bless you!\" She caught up his gloved hand as it rested on the door and kissed it until he snatched it away",

But really, you know there is a great deal of sense in what she wants, and you have apparently already won a large sum.\" The Frenchman was visibly surprised at this approach. He paused for a second or two in some doubt, and even awe, for the disinherited one carried the mark of a personage of consideration and of one whose position is secure. Then he gave a short, unmirthful laugh. \"You are most kind, sir,\" he said with mock politeness and with an impatient shrug. \"But madame, my wife, has not done well to interest a stranger in this affair, which, as you say, concerns you not.\" He turned to the table again with a defiant swagger of independence and placed two rolls of money upon the cloth, casting at the same moment a childish look of displeasure at his wife. \"You see,\" said the Plunger, with a deprecatory turning out of his hands. But there was so much grief on the girl's face that he turned again to the gambler and touched his arm. He could not tell why he was so interested in these two. He had witnessed many such scenes before, and they had not affected him in any way except to make him move out of hearing. But the same dumb numbness in his head, which made so many things seem possible that should have been terrible even to think upon, made him stubborn and unreasonable over this. He felt intuitively--it could not be said that he thought--that the woman was right and the man wrong, and so he grasped him again by the arm, and said sharply this time: \"Come away! Do you hear? You are acting foolishly.\" But even as he spoke the red won, and the Frenchman with a boyish gurgle of pleasure raked in his winnings with his two hands, and then turned with a happy, triumphant laugh to his wife. It is not easy to convince a man that he is making a fool of himself when he is winning some hundred francs every two minutes. His silent arguments to the contrary are difficult to answer. But the Plunger did not regard this in the least. \"Do you hear me?\" he said in the same stubborn tone and with much the same manner with which he would have spoken to a groom. \"Come away.\" Again the Frenchman tossed off his hand, this time with an execration, and again he placed the rolls of gold coin on the red; and again the red won. \"My God!\" cried the girl, running her fingers over the rolls on the table, \"he has won half of the 20,000 francs. Oh, sir, stop him, stop him!\" she cried. \"Take him away.\" \"Do you hear me!\" cried the Plunger, excited to a degree of utter",

He says to me, 'Bah! you are a woman'; and he is so red and fierce; he is imbecile with the sight of the money, but he will listen to a grand gentleman like you. He thinks to win more and more, and he thinks to buy another third from old Carbut. Is it not foolish? It is so wicked of him.\" \"Oh, yes,\" said the Goodwood Plunger, nodding, \"I see now. You want me to take him away so that he can keep what he has. I see; but I don't know him. He will not listen to me, you know; I have no right to interfere.\" He turned away, rubbing his hand across his forehead. He wished so much that this woman would leave him by himself. \"Ah, but, sir,\" cried the girl, desperately, and touching his coat, \"you who are so fortunate, and so rich, and of the great world, you cannot feel what this is to me. To have my own little shop and to be free, and not to slave, and sew, and sew until my back and fingers burn with the pain. Speak to him, sir; ah, speak to him! It is so easy a thing to do, and he will listen to you.\" The Goodwood Plunger turned again abruptly. \"Where is he?\" he said. \"Point him out to me.\" The woman ran ahead, with a murmur of gratitude, to the open door and pointed to where her husband was standing leaning over and placing some money on one of the tables. He was a handsome young Frenchman, as _bourgeois_ as his wife, and now terribly alive and excited. In the self-contained air of the place and in contrast with the silence of the great hall he seemed even more conspicuously out of place. The Plunger touched him on the arm, and the Frenchman shoved the hand off impatiently and without looking around. The Plunger touched him again and forced him to turn toward him. \"Well!\" said the Frenchman, quickly. \"Well?\" \"Madame, your wife,\" said Cecil, with the grave politeness of an old man, \"has done me the honor to take me into her confidence. She tells me that you have won a great deal of money; that you could put it to good use at home, and so save yourselves much drudgery and debt, and all that sort of trouble. You are quite right if you say it is no concern of mine. It is not.

The rest is a very common story. Fortune and greater fortune at first; days in which he could not lose, days in which he drove back to the crowded inns choked with dust, sunburnt and fagged with excitement, to a riotous supper and baccarat, and afterward went to sleep only to see cards and horses and moving crowds and clouds of dust; days spent in a short covert coat, with a field-glass over his shoulder and with a pasteboard ticket dangling from his buttonhole; and then came the change that brought conscience up again, and the visits to the Jews, and the slights of the men who had never been his friends, but whom he had thought had at least liked him for himself, even if he did not like them; and then debts, and more debts, and the borrowing of money to pay here and there, and threats of executions; and, with it all, the longing for the fields and trout springs of Surrey and the walk across the park to where she lived. This grew so strong that he wrote to his father, and was told briefly that he who was to have kept up the family name had dragged it into the dust of the race-courses, and had changed it at his own wish to that of the Boy Plunger--and that the breach was irreconcilable. Then this queer feeling came on, and he wondered why he could not eat, and why he shivered even when the room was warm or the sun shining, and the fear came upon him that with all this trouble and disgrace his head might give way, and then that it had given way. This came to him at all times, and lately more frequently and with a fresher, more cruel thrill of terror, and he began to watch himself and note how he spoke, and to repeat over what he had said to see if it were sensible, and to question himself as to why he laughed, and at what.

He had not only lost the right to sit at his father's table, but the right to think of the girl whose place in Surrey ran next to that of his own people, and whose lighted window in the north wing he had watched on those many dreary nights when she had been ill, from his own terrace across the trees in the park. And all he had gained was the notoriety that made him a by-word with decent people, and the hero of the race-tracks and the music-halls. He was no longer \"Young Harringford, the eldest son of the Harringfords of Surrey,\" but the \"Goodwood Plunger,\" to whom Fortune had made desperate love and had then jilted, and mocked, and overthrown. As he looked back at it now and remembered himself as he was then, it seemed as though he was considering an entirely distinct and separate personage--a boy of whom he liked to think, who had had strong, healthy ambitions and gentle tastes. He reviewed it passionlessly as he stood staring at the lights inside the Casino, as clearly as he was capable of doing in his present state and with miserable interest. How he had laughed when young Norton told him in boyish confidence that there was a horse named Siren in his father's stables which would win the Goodwood Cup; how, having gone down to see Norton's people when the long vacation began, he had seen Siren daily, and had talked of her until two every morning in the smoking-room, and had then staid up two hours later to watch her take her trial spin over the downs. He remembered how they used to stamp back over the long grass wet with dew, comparing watches and talking of the time in whispers, and said good night as the sun broke over the trees in the park. And then just at this time of all others, when the horse was the only interest of those around him, from Lord Norton and his whole household down to the youngest stable-boy and oldest gaffer in the village, he had come into his money. And then began the then and still inexplicable plunge into gambling, and the wagering of greater sums than the owner of Siren dared to risk himself, the secret backing of the horse through commissioners all over England, until the boy by his single fortune had brought the odds against her from 60 to 0 down to 6 to 0. He recalled, with a thrill that seemed to settle his nerves for the moment, the little black specks at the starting-post and the larger specks as the horses turned the first corner. The rest of the people on the coach were making a great deal of noise, he remembered, but he, who had more to lose than any one or all of them",
