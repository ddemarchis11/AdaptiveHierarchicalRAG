      "text": "your own, are you, by the water gate?\" \"Oh, yes,\" replied Forrester, rousing slightly. \"All quiet there. No more arrows. Converts behaving splendidly. Two or three have begged for guns.\" \"Give 'em this.\" Heywood skipped up the ladder, to return with a rifle. \"And this belt--Kempner's. Poor chap, he'll never ask you to return them.--Anything else?\" \"No,\" answered Gilly, taking the dead man's weapon, and moving off into the darkness. \"No, except \"--He halted. \"Except if we come to a pinch, and need a man for some tight place, then give me first chance. Won't you? I could do better, now, than--than you younger men. Oh, and Hackh; your efforts to-night--Well, few men would have dared, and I feel immensely grateful.\" He disappeared among the orange trees, leaving Rudolph to think about such gratitude. \"Now, then,\" called Heywood, and stooped to the white bundle at their feet. \"Don't stand looking. Can't be helped. Trust old Gilly to take it like a man. Come bear a hand.\" And between them the two friends carried to the nunnery a tiresome theorist, who had acted once, and now, himself tired and limp, would offend no more by speaking. When the dawn filled the compound with a deep blue twilight, and this in turn grew pale, the night-long menace of noise gradually faded also, like an orgy of evil spirits dispersing before cockcrow. To ears long deafened, the wide stillness had the effect of another sound, never heard before. Even when disturbed by the flutter of birds darting from top to dense green top of the orange trees, the air seemed hushed by some unholy constraint. Through the cool morning vapors, hot smoke from smouldering wreckage mounted thin and straight, toward where the pale disk of the moon dissolved in light. The convex field stood bare, except for a few overthrown scarecrows in naked yellow or dusty blue, and for a jagged strip of earthwork torn from the crest, over which the Black Dog thrust his round muzzle. In a truce of empty silence, the defenders slept by turns among the sand-bags. The day came, and dragged by without incident. The sun blazed in the compound, swinging overhead, and slanting down through the afternoon. At the water gate, Rudolph, Heywood, and the padre, with a few forlorn Christians,--driven in like sheep, at the last moment,--were building a rough screen against the arrows that had flown in darkness, and that now lay scattered along the path. One of these a workman suddenly caught at, and with a grunt, held up before the padre. The head was blunt. About the shaft, wound tightly with",

      "text": "I believe--he _would_ take me.\" The clinkered hills, quivering in the west, sank gradually into the heated blur above the plains. As gradually, the two men sank into dreams. Furious, metallic cries from the Pretty Lily woke them, in the blue twilight. She had moored her sampan alongside a flight of stone steps, up which, vigorously, with a bamboo, she now prodded her husband. He contended, snarling, but mounted; and when Heywood's silver fell jingling into her palm, lighted his lantern and scuffed along, a churlish guide. At the head of the slimy stairs, Heywood rattled a ponderous gate in a wall, and shouted. Some one came running, shot bolts, and swung the door inward. The lantern showed the tawny, grinning face of a servant, as they passed into a small garden, of dwarf orange trees pent in by a lofty, whitewashed wall. \"These grounds are yours, Hackh,\" said Heywood. \"Your predecessor's boy; and there\"--pointing to a lonely barrack that loomed white over the stunted grove--\"there's your house. You draw the largest in the station. A Portuguese nunnery, it was, built years ago. My boys are helping set it to rights; but if you don't mind, I'd like you to stay on at my beastly hut until this--this business takes a turn. Plenty of time.\" He nodded at the fat little orange trees. \"We may live to take our chow under those yet, of an evening. Also a drink. Eh?\" The lantern skipped before them across the garden, through a penitential courtyard, and under a vaulted way to the main door and the road. With Rudolph, the obscure garden and echoing house left a sense of magical ownership, sudden and fleeting, like riches in the Arabian Nights. The road, leaving on the right a low hill, or convex field, that heaved against the lower stars, now led the wanderers down a lane of hovels, among dim squares of smoky lamplight. Wu, their lantern-bearer, had turned back, and they had begun to pass a few quiet, expectant shops, when a screaming voice, ahead, outraged the evening stillness. At the first words, Heywood doubled his pace. \"Come along. Here's a lark--or a tragedy.\" Jostling through a malodorous crowd that blockaded the quarrel, they gained the threshold of a lighted shop. Against a rank of orderly shelves, a fat merchant stood at bay, silent, quick-eyed, apprehensive. Before him, like an actor in a mad scene, a sobbing ruffian, naked to the waist, convulsed with passion, brandished wild fists and ranted with incredible sounds.",

Others, in the shade of the wall, cackled when they saw a Son of the Red-Haired so beplastered and sopping. A few pointed at his bundle, with grunts of sudden interest; and a leper, bearing the visage as of a stone lion defaced by time, cried something harshly. At his words, the whole band of idlers began to chatter. Rudolph turned to aid his companion. She sat watching them sharply. An uneasy light troubled the innocent blue eyes, which had not even a glance for him. \"No, I shan't get down,\" she said angrily. \"It's just what might be--Your little brat will bring no good to any of us.\" He flung away defiantly, strode through the gate, and calling aloud, traversed an empty compound, already heated by the new-risen sun. A cooler fringe of veranda, or shallow cloister, lined a second court. Two figures met him,--the dark-eyed Miss Drake, all in white, and behind her a shuffling, grinning native woman, who carried a basin, in which permanganate of potash swam gleaming like diluted blood. \"Good-morning.\" With one droll look of amusement, the girl had understood, and regained that grave yet happy, friendly composure which had the virtue, he discovered, of being easily forgotten, to be met each time like something new. \"What have you there for us?\" Again he unfolded the jacket. \"A child.\" The naked mite lay very still, the breath weakly fluttered. A somewhat nauseous gift, the girl raised her arms and received it gently, without haste,--the saffron body appearing yet more squalid against the Palladian whiteness of her tunic, plain and cool as drapery in marble. \"It may live,\" she said. \"We'll do what we can.\" And followed by the black-trousered woman, she moved quickly away to offer battle with death. A plain, usual fact, it seemed, involving no more surprise than repugnance. Her face had hardly altered; and yet Rudolph, for the first time in many days, had caught the fleeting brightness of compassion. Mere light of the eyes, a half-imagined glory, incongruous in the sharp smell of antiseptics, it left him wondering in the cloister. He knew now what had been missing by the river. \"I was naked, and\"--how ran the lines? He turned to go, recalling in a whirl snatches of truth he had never known since boyhood, never seen away from home. Across a court the padre hailed",

His own friends: they might miss him once, but not twice. Let it come quickly. Instead, from the darkness above came the most welcome sound he had ever known,--a keen, high voice, scolding. \"What the devil are you firing at?\" It was Heywood, somewhere on the roof of the pony-shed. He put the question sharply, yet sounded cool and cheerful. \"A shadow? Rot! You waste another cartridge so, and I'll take your gun away. Remember that!\" Nesbit's voice clipped out some pert objection. \"Potted the beggar, any'ow--see for yourself--go-down 's afire.\" \"Saves us the trouble of burning it.\" The other voice moved away, with a parting rebuke. \"No more of that, sniping and squandering. Wait till they rush you.\" Rudolph lifted his head from the dust. \"Maurice!\" he called feebly. \"Maurice, let me in!\" \"Hallo!\" answered his captain on the wall, blithely. \"Steady on, we'll get you.\" Of all hardships, this brief delay was least bearable. Then a bight of rope fell across Rudolph's back. He seized it, hauled taut, and planting his feet against the wall, went up like a fish, to land gasping on a row of sand-bags. \"Ho, you wandering German!\" His invisible friend clapped him on the shoulder. \"By Jove, I'm glad. No time to burble now, though. Off with you. Compradore has a gun for you, in the court. Collect a drink as you go by. Report to Kneebone at the northeast corner. Danger point there: we need a good man, so hurry. Devilish glad. Cut along.\" Rudolph, scrambling down from the pony-shed, ran across the compound with his head in a whirl. Yet through all the scudding darkness and confusion, one fact had pierced as bright as a star. On this night of alarms, he had turned the great corner in his life. Like the pale stranger with his crown of fire, he could finish the course. He caught his rifle from the compradore's hand, but needed no draught from any earthly cup. Brushing through the orange trees, he made for the northeast angle, free of all longing perplexities, purged of all vile admiration, and fit to join his friends in clean and wholesome danger. CHAPTER XVIII SIEGE He never believed that they could hold the northeast corner for a minute, so loud and unceasing was the uproar. Bullets spattered sharply along the wall and sang",

For me, I vote no to that: no rice-Christians filling their bellies--eating us into a surrender!\" He made a pantomime of chop-sticks. \"A compound full, eating, eating!\" One or two nodded, approving the retort. Heywood, slightly lifting his chin, stared at the speaker coldly, down the length of their council-board. The red in his cheeks burned darker. \"Our everlasting shame, then,\" he replied quietly. \"It will be everlasting, if we leave these poor devils in the lurch, after cutting them loose from their people. Excuse me, padre, but it's no time to mince our words. We made them strangers in their own land. Desert 'em? Damned if we do!\" No one made reply. The padre, who had looked up, looked down quickly, musing, and smoothed his white hair with big fingers that somewhat trembled. \"Besides,\" continued the speaker, in a tone of apology, \"we'll need 'em to man the works. Meantime, you chaps must lend coolies, eh? Look here.\" With rising spirits, he traced an eager finger along the map. \"I must run a good strong bamboo scaffold along the inside wall, with plenty of sand-bags ready for loopholing--specially atop the servants' quarters and pony-shed, and in that northeast angle, where we'll throw up a mound or platform.--What do you say? Suggestions, please!\" Chantel, humming a tune, reached for his helmet, and rose. He paused, struck a match, and in an empty glass, shielding the flame against the breeze of the punkah, lighted a cigarette. \"Since we have appointed our dictator,\" he began amiably, \"we may repose--\" From the landing, without, a coolie bawled impudently for the master of the house. \"Wutzler!\" said Heywood, jumping up. \"I mean--his messenger.\" He was gone a noticeable time, but came back smiling. \"Good news, Gilly.\" He held aloft a scrap of Chinese paper, scrawled on with pencil. \"We need expect nothing these ten days. They wait for more ammunition--'more shoots,' the text has it. The Hak Kau--their Black Dog--is a bronze cannon, nine feet long, cast at Rotterdam in 1607.

Rudolph had given orders, that afternoon, to remove all necessary stores to the nunnery. But from somewhere in the darkness, one rioter brought a sack of flour, while another flung down a tin case of petroleum. The sword had no sooner cut the sack across and punctured the tin, than a fat villain in a loin cloth, squatting on the earthen floor, kneaded flour and oil into a grimy batch of dough. \"Will you speak out and live,\" cried the swordsman, \"or will you die?\" For a second the Christian did not stir. Then, as though the option were not in his power,-- \"Die,\" he answered. The fat baker sprang up, and clapped on the obstinate head a shapeless gray turban of dough. Half a dozen torches jostled for the honor of lighting it. The Christian, crowned with sooty flames, gave a single cry, clear above all the others. He was calling--as even Rudolph knew--on the strange god across the sea, Saviour of the Children of the West, not to forget his nameless and lonely servant. Rudolph groaned aloud, rose, and had parted the curtain to run out and fall upon them all, when suddenly, close at hand and sharp in the general din, there burst a quick volley of rifleshots. Splinters flew from the attap walls. A torch-bearer and the man with the sword spun half round, collided, and fell, the one across the other, like drunken wrestlers. The survivors flung down their torches and ran, leaping and diving over bales. On the ground, the smouldering Lamp of Heaven showed that its wearer, rescued by a lucky bullet, lay still in a posture of humility. Strange humility, it seemed, for one so suddenly given the complete and profound wisdom that confirms all faith, foreign or domestic, new or old. With a sense of all this, but no clear sense of action, Rudolph found the side-door, opened it, closed it, and started across the lane. He knew only that he should reach the mafoo's little gate by the pony-shed, and step out of these dark ages into the friendly present; so that when something from the wall blazed point-blank, and he fell flat on the ground, he lay in utter defeat, bitterly surprised and offended.
