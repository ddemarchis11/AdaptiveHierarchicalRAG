  "gold_answer": "The Devil's Throat is identified as a prominent feature of Kynance Cove, which is situated in Cornwall.",
  "llm_answer": "Within the context of Cornwall's geography, the feature known as the Devil's Throat is situated near Kynance Cove and the broader Lizard region.\n\nThe Devil's Throat is described as a rock with a yawning cave and a wide fissure between two rocks, which is considered a dangerous and perilous place. It is located near Kynance Cove, where a clergyman is seen warning two young people not to attempt to climb it, as it requires a good jump and can be fatal if one misses their footing.\n\nThe Devil's Throat is also referred to as Hell's Mouth by some folk. It is not recommended to attempt to climb or visit this location, as it is considered foolhardy and dangerous.\n\nIn contrast, Asparagus Island, which is nearby, is described as a safe and easy place to climb, and is recommended for visitors to Kynance Cove.",

We paused a minute, then put our fingers in our ears and fled. Gradually those fearful sounds melted away into distance, and left us to the silence of moonshine, and the sight, now grown familiar, but never less beautiful, of the far-gleaming Lizard Lights. DAY THE SEVENTH John Curgenven had said last night, with his air of tender patronising, half regal, half paternal, which we declared always reminded us of King Arthur--\"Ladies, whenever you settle to go to Kynance, I'll take you.\" And sure enough there he stood, at eight in the morning, quite a picture, his cap in one hand, a couple of fishes dangling from the other--he had brought them as a present, and absolutely refused to be paid--smiling upon us at our breakfast, as benignly as did the sun. He came to say that he was at our service till 10 A.M.; when he had an engagement. Our countenances fell. We did not like venturing in strange and dangerous ground, or rather sea, without our protector. But this was our last chance, and such a lovely day. \"You won't come to any harm, ladies,\" said the consoling John. \"I'll take you by a short cut across the down, much better than the cliff. You can't possibly miss your way: it'll lead you straight to Kynance, and then you go down a steep path to the Cove. You'll have plenty of time before the tide comes in to see everything.\" \"And to bathe?\" \"Oh yes, miss, there's the Drawing-room, the Dining-room, and the Kitchen--all capital caves close together; I wouldn't advise you to swim out far, though. And keep a sharp look out for the tide--it runs in pretty fast.\" \"And the scrambling?\" \"Oh, you can easy get on Asparagus Island, miss; it's quite safe. Only don't try the Devil's Throat--or Hell's Mouth, as some folk call it.\" Neither name was inviting; but studying our guide-books, we thought we could manage even without our friend. So, long ere the dew was dried on the sunshiny down, we all started off together, Curgenven slackening his quick active steps--very light and most enviably active for a man of his years--to accommodate us, and conversing courteously with us all the way.

Directly after breakfast--and we are people who never vary from our eight o'clock breakfast, so that we always see the world in its early morning brightness and freshness--we went \"Brushing with hasty steps the dew away,\" along the fields, which led down to Housel or Househole Cove. Before us, clear in the sunshine, rose the fine headland of Penolver, and the green <DW72>s of the amphitheatre of Belidden, supposed to be the remains of a Druidical temple. That, and the chair of Belidden, a recess in the rock, whence there is a splendid view, with various archaeological curiosities, true or traditionary, we ought to have examined, I know. But--we didn't do it. Some of us were content to rejoice in the general atmosphere of beauty and peace without minute investigation, and some of us were so eminently practical that \"a good bathe\" appeared more important than all the poetry and archaeology in the world. So we wandered slowly on, rejoicing at having the place all to ourselves, when we came suddenly upon a tall black figure intently watching three other black figures, or rather dots, which were climbing slowly over Penolver. It was our clerical friend of Kynance; with whom, in the natural and right civility of holiday-makers, we exchanged a courteous good morning. [Illustration: THE LION ROCKS--A SEA IN WHICH NOTHING CAN LIVE.] \"Yes, those are my girls up on the cliff there. They have been bathing, and are now going to walk to Cadgwith.\" \"Then nobody fell into the Devil's Throat at Kynance? They all came back to you with whole limbs?\" \"Yes,\" said he smiling, \"and they went again for another long walk in the afternoon. At night, when it turned out to be such splendid moonlight, they actually insisted on going launce-fishing. Of course you know about launce-fishing?\" I pleaded my utter ignorance of that noble sport. \"Oh, it is _the_ thing at the Lizard. My boys--and girls too--consider it the best fun going. The launce is a sort of sand-eel peculiar to these coasts. It swims about all day, and at night burrows in the sand just above the waterline, where, when the moon shines on it, you can trace the silvery gleam of the creature. So you stand up to your ankles on wet sand, with a crooked iron spear which you dart in and hook him up, keeping your left hand free to seize him with.\" \"Easy fishing,\" said I, with a certain pity for the sand-eel. \"Not so easy as appears. You are apt either to chop him right in two, or miss him altogether, when off he wriggles in the",

So I waited patiently, contemplating a fellow-victim who seemed worse off than myself; a benign-looking clergyman, who kept walking up and down the soppy sands, and shouting at intervals to two young people, a man and a woman, who appeared to be crawling like flies along the face of the rock towards another rock, with a yawning cave and a wide fissure between. \"Don't attempt it!\" the clergyman cried at the top of his voice. \"That's the Devil's Throat. She'll never manage it. Come down. Do make her come down.\" \"Your young people seem rather venturesome,\" said I sympathetically. [Illustration: THE STEEPLE ROCK, KYNANCE COVE.] \"Not _my_ young people,\" was the dignified answer. \"My girls are up there, on Asparagus Rock, which is easy enough climbing. They promised not to go farther, and they never disobey their mother and me. But those two! I declare he is taking her to the most dangerous part, that rock where you have to jump--a good jump it is, and if you miss your footing you are done for, you go right into the boiling waves below. Well, it's no business of mine; she is his own property; he is engaged to her, but\"-- I fear I made some very severe remarks on the folly of a young man who could thus risk life and limbs--not only his own, but those of his wife to be; and on the weakness of a girl who could allow herself to be tempted, even by a lover, into such selfish foolhardiness. \"They must manage their own affairs,\" said the old gentleman sententiously, perhaps not being so much given to preaching (out of the pulpit) as I was. \"My daughters are wiser. Here come two of them.\" And very sensible girls they looked, clad in a practical, convenient fashion, just fitted for scrambling. By them I sent a message to my own girls, explaining the best descent from Asparagus Island, and repeating the warning against attempting Hell's Mouth. \"Yes, you are quite right,\" said my elderly friend, as we sat down together on the least uncomfortable stone we could find, and watched the juniors disappear over the rocks. \"I like to see girls active and brave; I never hinder them in any reasonable enjoyment, even though there may be risk in it--one must run some risk--and a woman may have to save life as well as a man. But foolhardy bravado I not only dislike--I _despise_ it.\" In which sentiments I so entirely agreed that we fraternised there and then; began talking on all sorts of subjects--some of them the very serious and earnest subjects that one occasionally drops into by mere chance, with mere",

[Illustration: KYNANCE COVE, CORNWALL.] \"Ower the muir amang the heather\" have I tramped many a mile in bonnie Scotland, but this Cornish moor and Cornish heather were quite different. As different as the Cornishman with his bright, frank face, and his mixture of British honesty and Gallic courtesy, from the Scotch peasant--equally worthy, but sometimes just a trifle \"dour.\" John had plenty to say for himself, and said it well, with a quiet independence that there was no mistaking; never forgetting meanwhile to stop and offer a helping hand over every bit of rough road, puddle, or bog. He gave us a vivid picture of winter life at the Lizard: when the little community has to hybernate, like the squirrels and field-mice, upon its summer savings. \"Sometimes we don't earn a halfpenny for weeks and months, and then if we've got nothing to fall back upon it's a bad job, you see, ma'am.\" I asked him if much money went for drink; they seemed to me a remarkably sober set at the Lizard. \"Yes, I think we are; we're obliged to be; we can't spend money at the public-house, for we've got none to spend. I'm no teetotaller myself,\" added John boldly. \"I don't dislike a glass of beer now and then, if I can afford it, and when I can't afford it I can do without it, and if I do take it I always know when to stop.\" Ay, that is the crucial test--the knowing when to stop. It is this which makes all the difference between a good man and a villain, a wise man and a fool. Self-control--a quality which, guided by conscience and common sense, is the best possession of any human being. And looking at the honest fisherman, one felt pretty sure he had his share of it. \"Now I must leave you, ladies,\" said he, a great deal sooner than we wished, for we much liked talking to him. \"My time's nearly up, and I mustn't keep my gentleman waiting; he goes out in my boat every day, and has been a good friend to me. The road's straight before you, ladies; and there's another party just ahead of you. Follow the track, and you'll soon be at Kynance. It's a lovely day for the Cove, and I hope you'll enjoy yourselves.\" John bared his grey head, with a salutation worthy of some old knight of the Round Table, and then strode back, in double-quick time, as active and upright as any young fellow of twenty-five, across the level down.

The climate, Charles told me, is so mild, that invalids often settle down in the one inn--a mere village inn externally, but very comfortable. And, as I afterwards heard at Lizard Town, the parson and his wife--\"didn't I know them?\" and I felt myself rather looked down upon because I did not know them--are the kindest of people, who take pleasure in looking after the invalids, rich or poor. \"Yes,\" Charles considered Cadgwith was a nice place to winter in, \"only just a trifle dull.\" Probably so, to judge by the interest which, even in this tourist-season, our carriage excited, as we wound down one side and up another of the ravine in which the village is built, with a small fishing-station at the bottom, rather painfully odoriferous. The fisher-wives came to their doors, the old fisher-men stood, hands in pockets, the roly-poly healthy fisher-children stopped playing, to turn round and stare. In these parts everybody stares at everybody, and generally everybody speaks to everybody--a civil \"good-day\" at any rate, sometimes more. \"This is a heavy pull for you,\" said a sympathetic old woman, who had watched me leave the carriage and begin mounting the cliff towards the Devil's Frying-pan--the principal thing to be seen at Cadgwith. She followed me, and triumphantly passed me, though she had to carry a bag of potatoes on her back. I wondered if her feeling was pity or envy towards another old person who had to carry nothing but her own self. Which, alas! was enough! She and I sat down together on the hill-side and had a chat, while I waited for the two little black dots which I could see moving round the opposite headland. She gave me all kinds of information, in the simple way peculiar to country folk, whose innocent horizon comprises the whole world, which, may be, is less pleasant than the little world of Cadgwith. Then we parted for ever and aye. The Devil's Frying-pan is a wonderful sight. Imagine a natural amphitheatre two acres in extent, inclosed by a semi-circular <DW72> about two hundred feet high, covered with grass and flowers and low bushes. Outside, the wide, open sea, which pours in to the shingly beach at the bottom through an arch of serpentine, the colouring of which, and of the other rocks surrounding it, is most exquisite, varying from red to green, with sometimes a tint of grey.
