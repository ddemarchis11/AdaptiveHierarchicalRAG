  "llm_answer": "The triplets demonstrate the diffusion of harp-related musical practices from the Middle East into Europe through the following evidence:\n\n1. The harp was a favorite instrument of the Persians, and its introduction into Europe is attributed to the Persians and Arabs. (Novel-54537_c_36)\n2. The Arabs adopted the harp from the Persians and called it \"junk.\" (Novel-54537_c_36)\n3. The Turks derived their music from Persia, and a representation of a Turkish woman playing the harp, sketched from life by Melchior Lorich in the seventeenth century, may exhibit an old Persian \"chang.\" (Novel-54537_c_36)\n4. The harp was introduced into Europe through the Greeks and Romans, who brought eastern instruments into Europe during their conquests. (Novel-54537_c_26)\n5. The Phoenicians colonized Sardinia and introduced a double-pipe instrument called \"lionedda\" or \"launedda,\" which may have influenced the development of harp-related instruments in Europe. (Novel-54537_c_26)\n6. The Arabs introduced several of their instruments, including the harp, into Spain, from which country they became known in France, Germany, and England. (Novel-54537_c_26)\n7. The crusaders may have helped to familiarize western European nations with instruments of the east, including the harp.

Wind instruments of the flute kind,--including pipes, whistles, flutes, Pandean pipes, &c.--are also to be found almost everywhere. Much the same is the case with wind instruments of the trumpet kind. These are often made of the horns, bones, and tusks of animals; frequently of vegetable substances and of metal. Instruments of percussion of definite sonorousness are chiefly met with in China, Japan, Burmah, Siam, and Java. They not unfrequently contain a series of tones produced by slabs of wood or metal, which are beaten with a sort of hammer, as our harmonicon is played. Stringed instruments without a finger board, or any similar contrivance which enables the performer to produce a number of different tones on one string, are generally found among nations whose musical accomplishments have emerged from the earliest state of infancy. The strings are twanged with the fingers or with a piece of wood, horn, metal, or any other suitable substance serving as a _plectrum_; or are made to vibrate by being beaten with a hammer, as our dulcimer. Stringed instruments provided with a finger-board on which different tones are producible on one string by the performer shortening it more or less,--as on the guitar and violin,--are met with almost exclusively among nations in a somewhat advanced stage of musical progress. Such as are played with a bow are the least common; they are, however, known to the Chinese, Japanese, Hindus, Persians, Arabs, and a few other nations, besides those of Europe and their descendants in other countries. Wind instruments of the organ kind,--_i.e._, such as are constructed of a number of tubes which can be sounded together by means of a common mouthpiece or some similar contrivance, and upon which therefore chords and combinations of chords, or harmony, can be produced,--are comparatively of rare occurrence. Some interesting specimens of them exist in China, Japan, Laos, and Siam. Besides these various kinds of sound-producing means employed in musical performances, a few others less widely diffused could be pointed out, which are of a construction not represented in any of our well-known European specimens. For instance, some nations have peculiar instruments of friction, which can hardly be classed with our instruments of percussion. Again, there are contrivances in which a number of strings are caused to vibrate by a current of air, much as is the case with the Æolian harp; which might with equal propriety be considered either as stringed instruments or as wind instruments. In short, our usual classification of all the various species into three distinct divisions, viz. _Stringed Instruments_, _Wind Instruments_, and _Instruments of Percussion_, is not tenable if we extend our researches over the whole globe.",

At the present day instruments of the harmonium class have become such universal favourites in western Europe as almost to compete with the pianoforte. Several other well-authenticated instances could be cited in which one instrument has suggested the construction of another of a superior kind. The prototype of our pianoforte was evidently the dulcimer, known at an early time to the Arabs and Persians who call it _santir_. One of the old names given to the dulcimer by European nations is _cimbal_. The Poles at the present day call it _cymbaly_, and the Magyars in Hungary _cimbalom_. The _clavicembalo_, the predecessor of the pianoforte, was in fact nothing but a _cembalo_ with a key-board attached to it; and some of the old _clavicembali_, still preserved, exhibit the trapezium shape, the round hole in the middle of the sound-board, and other peculiarities of the first dulcimer. Again, the gradual development of the dulcimer from a rude contrivance, consisting merely of a wooden board across which a few strings are stretched, is distinctly traceable by a reference to the musical instruments of nations in different stages of civilization. The same is the case with our highly perfected harp, of which curious specimens, representing the instrument in its most primitive condition, are still to be found among several barbarous tribes. We might perhaps infer from its shape that it originally consisted of nothing more than an elastic stick bent by a string. The Damaras, a native tribe of South-western Africa, actually use their bow occasionally as a musical instrument, when they are not engaged in war or in the chase. They tighten the string nearly in the middle by means of a leathern thong, whereby they obtain two distinct sounds, which, for want of a sound-board, are of course very weak and scarcely audible to anyone but the performer. Some neighbouring tribes, however, possess a musical instrument very similar in appearance to the bow, to which they attach a gourd, hollowed and open at the top, which serves as a sound-board. Again, other African tribes have a similar instrument, superior in construction only inasmuch as it contains more than one string, and is provided with a sound-board consisting of a suitable piece of sonorous wood. In short, the more improved we find these contrivances the closer they approach our harp. And it could be shown if this were requisite for our present purpose that much the same gradual progress towards perfection, which we observe in the African harp, is traceable in the harps of several nations in different parts of the world. Moreover, a collection of musical instruments deserves the attention of the ethnologist",

Two harps of a peculiar shape were copied by Sir Gore Ousely from Persian manuscripts about four hundred years old resembling, in the principle on which they are constructed, all other oriental harps. There existed evidently various kinds of the _chang_. It may be remarked here that the instrument _tschenk_ (or _chang_) in use at the present day in Persia, is more like a dulcimer than a harp. The Arabs adopted the harp from the Persians, and called it _junk_. An interesting representation of a Turkish woman playing the harp (p. 53) sketched from life by Melchior Lorich in the seventeenth century, probably exhibits an old Persian _chang_; for the Turks derived their music principally from Persia. Here we have an introduction into Europe of the oriental frame without a front pillar. [Illustration] The Persians appear to have adopted, at an early period, smaller musical intervals than semitones. When the Arabs conquered Persia (A.D. 641) the Persians had already attained a higher degree of civilisation than their conquerors. The latter found in Persia the cultivation of music considerably in advance of their own, and the musical instruments superior also. They soon adopted the Persian instruments, and there can be no doubt that the musical system exhibited by the earliest Arab writers whose works on the theory of music have been preserved was based upon an older system of the Persians. In these works the octave is divided in seventeen _one-third-tones_--intervals which are still made use of in the east. Some of the Arabian instruments are constructed so as to enable the performer to produce the intervals with exactness. The frets on the lute and tamboura, for instance, are regulated with a view to this object. [Illustration] The Arabs had to some extent become acquainted with many of the Persian instruments before the time of their conquest of Persia. An Arab musician of the name of Nadr Ben el-Hares Ben Kelde is recorded as having been sent to the Persian king Khosroo Purviz, in the sixth century, for the purpose of learning Persian singing and performing on the lute. Through him, it is said, the lute was brought to Mekka. Saib Chatir, the son of a Persian, is spoken of as the first performer on the lute in Medina, A.D. 682; and of an Arab lutist, Ebn Soreidsch from Mekka, A.D. 683, it is especially mentioned that he played in the Persian style; evidently the superior one. The lute, _el-oud_, had before the tenth century only four strings, or four",

Another curious Hindu instrument, probably of very high antiquity, is the _poongi_, also called _toumrie_ and _magoudi_. It consists of a gourd or of the Cuddos nut, hollowed, into which two pipes are inserted. The _poongi_ therefore somewhat resembles in appearance a bagpipe. It is generally used by the _Sampuris_ or snake charmers, who play upon it when they exhibit the antics of the cobra. The name _magoudi_, given in certain districts to this instrument, rather tends to corroborate the opinion of some musical historians that the _magadis_ of the ancient Greeks was a sort of double-pipe, or bagpipe. Many instruments of Hindustan are known by different names in different districts; and, besides, there are varieties of them. On the whole, the Hindus possess about fifty instruments. To describe them properly would fill a volume. Some, which are in the Kensington museum, will be found noticed in the large catalogue of that collection. THE PERSIANS AND ARABS. Of the musical instruments of the ancient Persians, before the Christian era, scarcely anything is known. It may be surmised that they closely resembled those of the Assyrians, and probably also those of the Hebrews. [Illustration] The harp, _chang_, in olden time a favourite instrument of the Persians, has gradually fallen into desuetude. The illustration of a small harp given in the woodcut has been sketched from the celebrated sculptures, perhaps of the sixth century, which exist on a stupendous rock, called Tackt-i-Bostan, in the vicinity of the town of Kermanshah. These sculptures are said to have been executed during the lifetime of the Persian monarch Khosroo Purviz. They form the ornaments of two lofty arches, and consist of representations of field sports and aquatic amusements. In one of the boats is seated a man in an ornamental dress, with a halo round his head, who is receiving an arrow from one of his attendants; while a female, who is sitting near him, plays on a Trigonon. Towards the top of the bas-relief is represented a stage, on which are performers on small straight trumpets and little hand drums; six harpers; and four other musicians, apparently females,--the first of whom plays a flute; the second, a sort of pandean pipe; the third, an instrument which is too much defaced to be recognizable; and the fourth, a bagpipe.

The same was the case with the _buccina_,--originally perhaps a conch shell, and afterwards a simple horn of an animal,--and the _lituus_, which was bent at the broad end but otherwise straight. The _tympanum_ resembled the tambourine and was beaten like the latter with the hands. Among the Roman instruments of percussion the _scabillum_, which consisted of two plates combined by means of a sort of hinge, deserves to be noticed; it was fastened under the foot and trodden in time, to produce certain rhythmical effects in musical performances. The _cymbalum_ consisted of two metal plates similar to our cymbals. The _crotala_ and the _crusmata_ were kinds of castanets, the former being oblong and of a larger size than the latter. The Romans had also a _triangulum_, which resembled the triangle occasionally used in our orchestra. The _sistrum_ they derived from Egypt with the introduction of the worship of Isis. Metal bells, arranged according to a regular order of intervals and placed in a frame, were called _tintinnabula_. The _crepitaculum_ appears to have been a somewhat similar contrivance on a hoop with a handle. Through the Greeks and Romans we have the first well-authenticated proof of musical instruments having been introduced into Europe from Asia. The Romans in their conquests undoubtedly made their musical instruments known, to some extent, also in western Europe. But the Greeks and Romans are not the only nations which introduced eastern instruments into Europe. The Phœnicians at an early period colonized Sardinia, and traces of them are still to be found on that island. Among these is a peculiarly constructed double-pipe, called _lionedda_ or _launedda_. Again, at a much later period the Arabs introduced several of their instruments into Spain, from which country they became known in France, Germany, and England. Also the crusaders, during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, may have helped to familiarize the western European nations with instruments of the east. CHAPTER V. THE CHINESE. Allowing for any exaggeration as to chronology, natural to the lively imagination of Asiatics, there is no reason to doubt that the Chinese possessed long before our Christian era musical instruments to which they attribute a fabulously high antiquity. There is an ancient tradition, according to which they obtained their musical scale from a miraculous bird, called foung-hoang, which appears to have been a sort of phœnix. When Confucius, who lived about B.C. 500, happened to hear on a certain occasion some Chinese music, he became so greatly enraptured that he could not take any food for three months afterwards. The sounds which produced this effect were those of Kouei, the Orpheus",

      "text": "It is difficult to determine whether the number of strings represented is six or seven; but, as has been already remarked, accuracy in this respect cannot be expected either in sculptures or in many picturesque drawings.” The Finns had a harp (_harpu_, _kantele_) with a similar frame, devoid of a front pillar, still in use until the commencement of the present century. [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration] One of the most interesting stringed instruments of the middle ages is the _rotta_ (German, _rotte_; English, _rote_). It was sounded by twanging the strings, and also by the application of the bow. The first method was, of course, the elder one. There can hardly be a doubt that when the bow came into use it was applied to certain popular instruments which previously had been treated like the _cithara_ or the _psalterium_. The Hindus at the present day use their _suroda_ sometimes as a lute and sometimes as a fiddle. In some measure we do the same with the violin by playing occasionally _pizzicato_. The _rotta_ (shown p. 91) from the manuscript of St. Blasius is called in Gerbert’s work _cithara teutonica_, while the harp is called _cithara anglica_; from which it would appear that the former was regarded as pre-eminently a German instrument. Possibly its name may have been originally _chrotta_ and the continental nations may have adopted it from the Celtic races of the British isles, dropping the guttural sound. This hypothesis is, however, one of those which have been advanced by some musical historians without any satisfactory evidence. [Illustration] [Illustration] We engrave also another representation of David playing on the _rotta_, from a psalter of the seventh century in the British museum (Cott. Vesp. A. I). According to tradition, this psalter is one of the manuscripts which were sent by pope Gregory to St. Augustine. The instrument much resembles the lyre in the hand of the musician (see p. 22) who is supposed to be a Hebrew of the time of Joseph. In the _rotta_ the ancient Asiatic lyre is easily to be recognized. An illumination of king David playing the _rotta_ forms the frontispiece of a manuscript of the eighth century preserved in the cathedral library of Durham; and which is musically interesting inasmuch as it represents a _rotta_ of an oblong square shape like that just noticed and resembling the Welsh _crwth_. It has only five strings which the performer twangs with his fingers. Again, a very interesting representation (which we engrave) of the Psalmist with a kind of _rotta_ occurs in a manuscript of the tenth century, in the British museum",
