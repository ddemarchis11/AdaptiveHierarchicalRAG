  "llm_answer": "The use of alcohol might affect the body's ability to move the chest by impacting the muscles of the chest. According to the evidence, alcohol often changes a part of the muscles to fat, which takes away a part of their strength. This is stated in Chapter III, \"WHAT ALCOHOL WILL DO TO THE MUSCLES. Muscles are lean meat. Fat meat could not work your joints for you as the muscles do. Alcohol often changes a part of the muscles to fat, and so takes away a part of their strength.\"",

The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku lar) walls. Every time we breathe, these walls have to move. The muscles of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you breathe. All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is directed by the nerves. You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so you are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs. Is alcohol a help to them? REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1.

[Illustration: T]HERE is another part of your body carrying away waste matter all the time--it is the skin. The body is covered with skin. It is also lined with a more delicate kind of skin. You can see where the outside skin and the lining skin meet at your lips. There is a thin outside layer of skin which we can pull off without hurting ourselves; but I advise you not to do so. Because under the outside skin is the true skin, which is so full of little nerves that it will feel the least touch as pain. When the outer skin, which protects it, is torn away, we must cover the true",

      "text": "OF MIND. We have been talking about the strength of muscles; but the very best kind of strength we have is brain strength, or strength of mind. Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can not carry their messages correctly. Then the brain can not think well. Alcohol does not strengthen the mind. Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make him useful and happy. Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole. Would you be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a palace, and had a million of dollars? If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not let alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. What things were left out of our bill of fare?           2. How could you measure your strength?           3. How can you gain strength?           4. Why does drinking beer not make you strong?           5. Show why drinking wine or any other alcoholic           drink will not make you strong.           6.

[Illustration: T]HE heart is in the chest, the upper part of the strong box which the ribs, spine, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones make for each of us. It is made of very thick, strong muscles, as you can see by looking at a beef's heart, which is much like a man's, but larger. HOW THE HEART WORKS. Probably some of you have seen a fire-engine throwing a stream of water through a hose upon a burning building. As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped",

There is another enemy to the muscles about which I must tell you. WHAT ALCOHOL WILL DO TO THE MUSCLES. Muscles are lean meat. Fat meat could not work your joints for you as the muscles do. Alcohol often changes a part of the muscles to fat, and so takes away a part of their strength. In this way, people often grow very fleshy from drinking beer, because it contains alcohol, as you will soon learn. But they can not work any better on account of having this fat. They are not really any stronger for it. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. How are the joints moved?           2.

[Illustration: H]OW do the muscles know when to move? You have all seen the telegraph wires, by which messages are sent from one town to another, all over the country. You are too young to understand how this is done, but you each have something inside of you, by which you are sending messages almost every minute while you are awake.

You have to take hold of the door to move it back and forth; but you need not take hold of your arm to move that. What makes it move? Sometimes a door or gate is made to shut itself, if you leave it open. This can be done by means of a wide rubber strap, one end of which is fastened to the frame of the door near the hinge, and the other end to the door, out near its edge. When we push open the door, the rubber strap is stretched; but as soon as we have passed through, the strap tightens, draws the door back, and shuts it. If you stretch out your right arm, and clasp the upper part tightly with your left hand, then work the elbow joint strongly back and forth, you can feel something under your hand draw up, and then lengthen out again, each time you bend the joint. What you feel, is a muscle (m[)u]s'sl), and it works your joints very much as the rubber strap works the hinge of the door. One end of the muscle is fastened to the bone just below the elbow joint; and the other end, higher up above the joint. When it",
