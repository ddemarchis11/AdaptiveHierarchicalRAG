But if you have loved her once, you may love her again; whatever it was that separated you in the past, that separates you now, that makes you prefer my daughter to her, may come to an end when you are married, when it will be too late, and when only trouble can come of it, and Ellen would bear that trouble. Can I risk that?\" \"But I tell you it is impossible,\" cried the young man. \"The woman is beyond the love of any man, at least such a man as I am, or try to be.\" \"Do you mean,\" asked the bishop, gently, and with an eager look of hope, \"that she is dead?\" Latimer faced the father for some seconds in silence. Then he raised his head slowly. \"No,\" he said, \"I do not mean she is dead. No, she is not dead.\" Again the bishop moved back wearily into his chair. \"You mean then,\" he said, \"perhaps, that she is a married woman?\" Latimer pressed his lips together at first as though he would not answer, and then raised his eyes coldly. \"Perhaps,\" he said. The older man had held up his hand as if to signify that what he was about to say should be listened to without interruption, when a sharp turning of the lock of the door caused both father and the suitor to start. Then they turned and looked at each other with anxious inquiry and with much concern, for they recognized for the first time that their voices had been loud. The older man stepped quickly across the floor, but before he reached the middle of the room the door opened from the outside, and his daughter stood in the door-way, with her head held down and her eyes looking at the floor. \"Ellen!\" exclaimed the father, in a voice of pain and the deepest pity. The girl moved toward the place from where his voice came, without raising her eyes, and when she reached him put her arms about him and hid her face on his shoulder. She moved as though she were tired, as though she were exhausted by some heavy work. \"My child,\" said the bishop, gently, \"were you listening?\" There was no reproach in his voice; it was simply full of pity and concern. \"I thought,\" whispered the girl, brokenly, \"that he would be frightened; I wanted to hear what he would say. I thought I could laugh at him for it afterward. I did it for a joke. I thought--\" she stopped with a little gasping sob that she tried to hide, and for a moment held herself erect and then sank back again into her father's arms with her head upon his breast. Latimer started forward, holding out his arms to her. \"Ellen,\" he said, \"surely, Ellen, you are not against me. You see how",

Are you going to condemn men who are ice-locked at the North Pole, or buried in the heart of Africa, and who have given up all thought of return and are half mad and wholly without hope, as you would judge ourselves? Are they to be weighed and balanced as you and I are, sitting here within the sound of the cabs outside and with a bake-shop around the corner? What you propose could not exist, could never happen. I could never be placed where I should have to make such a choice, and you have no right to ask me what I would do or how I would act under conditions that are super-human--you used the word yourself--where all that I have held to be good and just and true would be obliterated. I would be unworthy of myself, I would be unworthy of your daughter, if I considered such a state of things for a moment, or if I placed my hopes of marrying her on the outcome of such a test, and so, sir,\" said the young man, throwing back his head, \"I must refuse to answer you.\" The bishop lowered his hand from before his eyes and sank back wearily into his chair. \"You have answered me,\" he said. \"You have no right to say that,\" cried the young man, springing to his feet. \"You have no right to suppose anything or to draw any conclusions. I have not answered you.\" He stood with his head and shoulders thrown back, and with his hands resting on his hips and with the fingers working nervously at his waist. \"What you have said,\" replied the bishop, in a voice that had changed strangely, and which was inexpressibly sad and gentle, \"is merely a curtain of words to cover up your true feeling. It would have been so easy to have said, 'For thirty days or for life Ellen is the only woman who has the power to make me happy.' You see that would have answered me and satisfied me. But you did not say that,\" he added, quickly, as the young man made a movement as if to speak. \"Well, and suppose this other woman did exist, what then?\" demanded Latimer. \"The conditions you suggest are impossible; you must, you will surely, sir, admit that.\" \"I do not know,\" replied the bishop, sadly; \"I do not know. It may happen that whatever obstacle there has been which has kept you from her may be removed. It may be that she has married, it may be that she has fallen so low that you cannot marry her.

They, no doubt, understood what was coming better than myself, and were meaning to reassure me concerning you. And they said nothing but what was good of you. But there are certain things of which no one can know but yourself, and concerning which no other person, save myself, has a right to question you. You have promised very fairly for my daughter's future; you have suggested more than you have said, but I understood. You can give her many pleasures which I have not been able to afford; she can get from you the means of seeing more of this world in which she lives, of meeting more people, and of indulging in her charities, or in her extravagances, for that matter, as she wishes. I have no fear of her bodily comfort; her life, as far as that is concerned, will be easier and broader, and with more power for good. Her future, as I say, as you say also, is assured; but I want to ask you this,\" the bishop leaned forward and watched the young man anxiously, \"you can protect her in the future, but can you assure me that you can protect her from the past?\" Young Latimer raised his eyes calmly and said, \"I don't think I quite understand.\" \"I have perfect confidence, I say,\" returned the bishop, \"in you as far as your treatment of Ellen is concerned in the future. You love her and you would do everything to make the life of the woman you love a happy one; but this is it, Can you assure me that there is nothing in the past that may reach forward later and touch my daughter through you--no ugly story, no oats that have been sowed, and no boomerang that you have thrown wantonly and that has not returned--but which may return?\" \"I think I understand you now, sir,\" said the young man, quietly. \"I have lived,\" he began, \"as other men of my sort have lived. You know what that is, for you must have seen it about you at college, and after that before you entered the Church. I judge so from your friends, who were your friends then, I understand. You know how they lived. I never went in for dissipation, if you mean that, because it never attracted me. I am afraid I kept out of it not so much out of respect for others as for respect for myself. I found my self-respect was a very good thing to keep, and I rather preferred keeping it and losing several pleasures that other men managed to enjoy, apparently with free consciences. I confess I used to rather envy them. It is no particular virtue on my part; the thing struck me as rather more vulgar than wicked, and so I have had no wild oats to speak of; and no",

He drew back from the girl in his arms and looked anxiously and feelingly at her lover. \"How could you, Ellen,\" he said, \"how could you?\" He was watching the young man's face with eyes full of sympathy and concern. \"How little you know him,\" he said, \"how little you understand. He will not do that,\" he added quickly, but looking questioningly at Latimer and speaking in a tone almost of command. \"He will not undo all that he has done; I know him better than that.\" But Latimer made no answer, and for a moment the two men stood watching each other and questioning each other with their eyes. Then Latimer turned, and without again so much as glancing at the girl walked steadily to the door and left the room. He passed on slowly down the stairs and out into the night, and paused upon the top of the steps leading to the street. Below him lay the avenue with its double line of lights stretching off in two long perspectives. The lamps of hundreds of cabs and carriages flashed as they advanced toward him and shone for a moment at the turnings of the cross-streets, and from either side came the ceaseless rush and murmur, and over all hung the strange mystery that covers a great city at night. Latimer's rooms lay to the south, but he stood looking toward a spot to the north with a reckless, harassed look in his face that had not been there for many months. He stood so for a minute, and then gave a short shrug of disgust at his momentary doubt and ran quickly down the steps. \"No,\" he said, \"if it were for a month, yes; but it is to be for many years, many more long years.\" And turning his back resolutely to the north he went slowly home. THE TRAILER FOR ROOM NO. 8 The \"trailer\" for the green-goods men who rented room No. 8 in Case's tenement had had no work to do for the last few days, and was cursing his luck in consequence. He was entirely too young to curse, but he had never been told so, and, indeed, so imperfect had his training been that he had never been told not to do anything as long as it pleased him to do it and made existence any more bearable. He had been told when he was very young, before the man and woman who had brought him into the world had separated, not to crawl out on the fire-escape, because he might break his neck, and",

However,\" he added, smiling, as he pushed the manuscript to one side, \"we are not going to talk about that now. What have you to tell me that is new?\" The younger man glanced up quickly at this, but the bishop's face showed that his words had had no ulterior meaning, and that he suspected nothing more serious to come than the gossip of the clubs or a report of the local political fight in which he was keenly interested, or on their mission on the East Side. But it seemed an opportunity to Latimer. \"I _have_ something new to tell you,\" he said, gravely, and with his eyes turned toward the open fire, \"and I don't know how to do it exactly. I mean I don't just know how it is generally done or how to tell it best.\" He hesitated and leaned forward, with his hands locked in front of him, and his elbows resting on his knees. He was not in the least frightened. The bishop had listened to many strange stories, to many confessions, in this same study, and had learned to take them as a matter of course; but to-night something in the manner of the young man before him made him stir uneasily, and he waited for him to disclose the object of his visit with some impatience. \"I will suppose, sir,\" said young Latimer, finally, \"that you know me rather well--I mean you know who my people are, and what I am doing here in New York, and who my friends are, and what my work amounts to. You have let me see a great deal of you, and I have appreciated your doing so very much; to so young a man as myself it has been a great compliment, and it has been of great benefit to me. I know that better than any one else. I say this because unless you had shown me this confidence it would have been almost impossible for me to say to you what I am going to say now. But you have allowed me to come here frequently, and to see you and talk with you here in your study, and to see even more of your daughter. Of course, sir, you did not suppose that I came here only to see you. I came here because I found that if I did not see Miss Ellen for a day, that that day was wasted, and that I spent it uneasily and discontentedly, and the necessity of seeing her even more frequently has grown so great that I cannot come here as often as I seem to want to",
