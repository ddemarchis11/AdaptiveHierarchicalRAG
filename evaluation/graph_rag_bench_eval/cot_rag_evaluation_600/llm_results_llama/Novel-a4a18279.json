  "llm_answer": "Within the context of Dragon's Blood, revealing that Wutzler is a member of the Triad and introducing the White Lotus as a secret band led by Fang the Sword-Pen serves to deepen Wutzler's character and connect him to the larger web of clandestine organizations operating in the story in the following ways:\n\n1. **Complexity of Wutzler's character**: By revealing Wutzler's membership in the Triad, his character becomes more complex and nuanced. It shows that he is not just a simple outcast, but a member of a secret society with its own codes and rituals. This complexity makes him a more believable and relatable character.\n\n2. **Connection to the larger web of organizations**: The introduction of the White Lotus as a secret band led by Fang the Sword-Pen connects Wutzler to a larger web of clandestine organizations operating in the story. This creates a sense of depth and scope, suggesting that there are many more secrets and conspiracies lurking beneath the surface.\n\n3. **Motivation and backstory**: Wutzler's membership in the Triad and his connection to the White Lotus provide a motivation for his actions and a backstory that explains his behavior. This helps to create a sense of continuity and coherence in the story.\n\n4. **Thematic resonance**: The revelation of Wutzler's membership in the Triad and his connection to the White Lotus resonates with the themes of the story, which include the struggle between different cultures and the power of secret societies. This adds depth and meaning to the narrative.\n\n5. **Character development**: The introduction of the White Lotus and Fang the Sword-Pen as a secret band creates opportunities for character development and plot progression. It raises questions about the nature of the White Lotus, its goals, and its relationship to the Triad, which can be explored in future scenes.\n\nIn summary, revealing that Wutzler is a member of the Triad and introducing the White Lotus as a secret band led by Fang the Sword-Pen serves to deepen Wutzler's character, connect him to the larger web of clandestine organizations operating in the story, and create opportunities for character development and plot progression.",

He taught her the verses at home, for safety.--We mean no harm, now, we of the Triad. But there is another secret band, having many of our signs. It is said they ape our ritual. Fang the scholar heads their lodge. They are the White Lotus.\" \"White Lotus?\" Heywood snapped his fingers. \"Nonsense. Extinct, this hundred years.\" \"Extinct? They meet to-night,\" said the outcast, in sudden grief and passion. \"They drink blood--plan blood. Extinct? Are _you_ married to these people? Does the knowledge come so cheap, or at a price? All these years--darkness--sunken--alone\"--He trembled violently, but regained his voice. \"O my friend! This very night they swear in recruits, and set the day. I know their lodge-room. For any sake, believe me! I know!\" \"Right,\" said Heywood, curtly. \"I believe you. But why come here? Why not stay, and learn more?\" Wutzler's head dropped on his breast again. The varnished hat gleamed softly in the darkness. \"I--I dare not stay,\" he sobbed. \"Oh, exactly!\" Heywood flung out an impatient arm. \"The date, man! The day they set. You came away without it!--We sit tight, then, and wait in ignorance.\" The droll, withered face, suddenly raised, shone with great tears that streaked the mangrove stain. \"My head sits loosely already, with what I have done to-night. I found a listening place--next door: a long roof. You can hear and see them--But I could not stay. Yes, I am a coward.\" \"There, there!\" Heywood patted his shoulder. \"I didn't mean--Here, have a drink.\" The man drained the tumbler at a gulp; stood without a word, sniffing miserably; then of a sudden, as though the draught had worked, looked up bold and shrewd. \"Do you?\" he whispered. \"Do _you_ dare go to the place I show you, and hide? You would learn.\" Heywood started visibly, paused, then laughed. \"Excellent,\" he said. \"_Tu quoque_ is good argument. Can you smuggle me?--Then come on.\" He stepped lightly across the landing, and called out, \"You chaps make yourselves at home, will you? Business, you know. What a bore! I'll not be back till late.\" And as he followed the slinking form downstairs, he grumbled, \"If at all,",

The postscript ran in the same shaky hand:-- \"Send way the others both.\" \"What!\" cried the young master of the house; and then over his shoulder, \"Excuse us a moment--me, I should say.\" He led the dwarfish coolie across the landing, to the deserted dinner-table. The creature darted past him, blew out one candle, and thrust the other behind a bottle, so that he stood in a wedge of shadow. \"Eng-lish speak I ver' badt,\" he whispered; and then with something between gasp and chuckle, \"but der _pak-wa_ goot, no? When der live dependt, zo can mann--\" He caught his breath, and trembled in a strong seizure. \"Good?\" whispered Heywood, staring. \"Why, man, it's wonderful! You _are_ a coolie\"--Wutzler's conical wicker-hat ducked as from a blow. \"I beg your pardon. I mean, you're--\" The shrunken figure pulled itself together. \"You are right,\" he whispered, in the vernacular. \"To-night I am a coolie--all but the eyes. Therefore this hat.\" Heywood stepped back to the door, and popped his head out. The dim hall was empty. \"Go on,\" he said, returning. \"What is your news?\" \"Riots. They are coming. We are all marked for massacre. All day I ran about the town, finding out. The trial of Chok Chung, your--_our_ Christian merchant--I saw him 'cross the hall.' They kept asking, 'Do you follow the foreign dogs and goats?' But he would only answer, 'I follow the Lord Jesus.' So then they beat out his teeth with a heavy shoe, and cast him into prison. Now they wait, to see if his padre will interfere with the law. It is a trap. The suit is certainly brought by Fang the scholar, whom they call the Sword-Pen.\" \"That much,\" said Heywood, \"I could have told you.\" Wutzler glanced behind him fearfully, as though the flickering shadows might hear. \"But there is more. Since dark I ran everywhere, watching, listening to gossip. I painted my skin with mangrove-bark water. You know this sign?\" He patted his right leg, where the roll of trousers bound his thigh. \"It is for protection in the streets. It says, 'I am a Heaven-and-Earth man.'\" \"The Triad!\" Heywood whistled. \"You?\" The other faltered, and hung his head. \"Yes,\" he whispered at last. \"My--my wife's cousin, he is a Grass Sandal.

I'll not be back till late.\" And as he followed the slinking form downstairs, he grumbled, \"If at all, perhaps.\" The moon still lurked behind the ocean, making an aqueous pallor above the crouching roofs. The two men hurried along a \"goat\" path, skirted the town wall, and stole through a dark gate into a darker maze of lonely streets. Drawing nearer to a faint clash of cymbals in some joss-house, they halted before a blind wall. \"In the first room,\" whispered the guide, \"a circle is drawn on the floor. Put your right foot there, and say, 'We are all in-the-circle men,' If they ask, remember: you go to pluck the White Lotus. These men hate it, they are Triad brothers, they will let you pass. You come from the East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls; you studied in the Red Flower Pavilion; your eyes are bloodshot because\"--He lectured earnestly, repeating desperate nonsense, over and over. \"No: not so. Say it exactly, after me.\" They held a hurried catechism in the dark. \"There,\" sighed Wutzler, at last, \"that is as much as we can hope. Do not forget. They will pass you through hidden ways.--But you are very rash. It is not too late to go home.\" Receiving no answer, he sighed more heavily, and gave a complicated knock. Bars clattered within, and a strip of dim light widened. \"Who comes?\" said a harsh but guarded voice, with a strong Hakka brogue. \"A brother,\" answered the outcast, \"to pluck the White Lotus. Aid, brothers.--Go in, I can help no further. If you are caught, slide down, and run westward to the gate which is called the Meeting of the Dragons.\" Heywood nodded, and slipped in. Beside a leaf-point flame of peanut-oil, a broad, squat giant sat stiff and still against the opposite wall, and stared with cruel, unblinking eyes. If the stranger were the first white man to enter, this motionless grim janitor gave no sign. On the earthen floor lay a small circle of white lime. Heywood placed his right foot inside it. \"We are all in-the-circle men.\" \"Pass,\" said the guard. Out from shadow glided a tall native with a halberd, who opened a door in the far corner. In the second room, dim as the first, burned the same smoky orange light on the same table. But here a twisted <DW36>, his nose long and pendulous with elephantiasis, presided over three cups of tea set in",

The shutter grated open, a flood of light poured out. Within reach, in that radiance, a pair of sinewy yellow hands gripped the neck of a white cock. The wretched bird squawked once more, feebly, flapped its wings, and clawed the air, just as a second pair of arms reached out and sliced with a knife. The cock's head flew off upon the tiles. Hot blood spattered on Heywood's cheek. Half blinded, but not daring to move, he saw the knife withdrawn, and a huge goblet held out to catch the flow. Then arms, goblet, and convulsive wings jerked out of sight, and the shutter slid home. \"Twice they've not seen me,\" thought Heywood. It was darker, here, than he had hoped. He rose more boldly to the peep-hole. Under the arch of swords, the new recruits, now standing upright, stretched one by one their wrists over the goblet. The Incense Master pricked each yellow arm, to mingle human blood with the blood of the white cock; then, from a brazen vessel, filled the goblet to the brim. It passed from hand to hand, like a loving-cup. Each novice raised it, chanted some formula, and drank. Then all dispersed. There fell a silence. Suddenly, in the pale face of the black image seated before the shrine, the eyes turned, scanning the company with a cold contempt. The lips moved. The voice, level and ironic, was that of Fang, the Sword-Pen:-- \"O Fragrant Ones, when shall the foreign monsters perish like this cock?\" A man in black, with a red wand, bowed and answered harshly:-- \"The time, Great Elder Brother, draws at hand.\" \"How shall we know the hour?\" \"The hour,\" replied the Red Wand, \"shall be when the Black Dog barks.\" \"And the day?\" Heywood pressed his ear against the chink, and listened, his five senses fused into one. No answer came, but presently a rapid, steady clicking, strangely familiar and commonplace. He peered in again. The Red Wand stood by the abacus, rattling the brown beads with flying fingers, like a shroff. Plainly, it was no real calculation, but a ceremony before the answer. The listener clapped his ear to the crevice. Would that answer, he wondered, be a month, a week, to-morrow? The shutter banged, the light streamed, down went Heywood against the plaster. Thick dregs from the goblet splashed on the tiles. A head, the flattened profile of the brisk man in yellow, leaned far out from the little port-hole. Grunting, he",
