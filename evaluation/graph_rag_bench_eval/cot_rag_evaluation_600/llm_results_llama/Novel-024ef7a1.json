Then, when you begin to have some idea how much six hundred millions is, remember that six hundred million dollars are spent in this country every year for tobacco--burned up--wasted--worse than wasted. Do you think the farmer who planted tobacco instead of corn, did any good to the world by the change? REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. How may one waste money?           2. Name some good ways for spending money.           3. How does the liquor-drinker spend his money?           4. What could we do, if no money was spent for           liquor?           5. Tell two ways in which you could burn up a           dollar bill.           6. Which would be the safer way?           7.

      "text": "is an organ which takes care of the food we eat. THE TEETH. [Illustration: _Different kinds of teeth._] Your teeth do not look alike, since they must do different kinds of work. The front ones cut, the back ones grind. They are made of a kind of bone covered with a hard smooth enamel ([)e]n [)a]m'el). If the enamel is broken, the teeth soon decay and ache, for each tooth is furnished with a nerve that very quickly feels pain. CARE OF THE TEETH. Cracking nuts with the teeth, or even biting thread, is apt to break the enamel; and when once broken, you will wish in vain to have it mended. The dentist can fill a hole in the tooth; but he can not cover the tooth with new enamel. Bits of food should be carefully picked from between the teeth with a tooth-pick of quill or wood, never with a pin or other hard and sharp thing which might break the enamel. The teeth must also be well brushed. Nothing but perfect cleanliness will keep them in good order. Always brush them before breakfast. Your breakfast will taste all the better for it. Brush them at night before you go to bed, lest some food should be decaying in your mouth during the night. Take care of these cutters and grinders, that they may not decay, and so be unable to do their work well. THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN. You have learned about the twenty-four little bones in the spine, and the ribs that curve around from the spine to the front, or breast-bone. These bones, with the shoulder-blades and the collar-bones, form a bony case or box. In it are some of the most useful organs of the body. This box is divided across the middle by a strong muscle, so that we may say it is two stories high. The upper room is called the chest; the lower one, the abdomen ([)a]b d[=o]'m[)e]n). In the chest, are the heart and the lungs. In the abdomen, are the stomach, the liver, and some other organs. THE STOMACH. The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful a bag as could be made, you will say, when I tell you what it can do. The outside is made of muscles; the lining prepares a juice called gastric (g[)a]s'tr[)i]k) juice, and keeps it always ready for use. Now, what would you think if a man could put into a bag, beef, and apples, and potatoes, and bread and milk, and sugar, and salt, tie up the bag and lay it away on a shelf for a few hours, and then show you that the beef had disappeared, so had the apples, so had the potatoes, the bread and milk, sugar, and",

So arranged, it recalled vividly the Chaldean and Egyptian deities having heads of human beings and bodies of animals. The next object that called my attention was another slab on which was represented in bas-relief a dying warrior, reclining on his back, the head was thrown entirely backwards. His left arm was placed across his chest, the left hand resting on the right shoulder, exactly in the same position which the Egyptians were wont, at times, to give to the mummies of some of their eminent men. From his mouth was seen escaping two thin, narrow flames--the spirit of the dying man abandoning the body with the last warm breath. These and many other sculptures caused me to suspect that this monument had been the mausoleum raised to the memory of the warrior with the shield covered with the round dots. Next to the slabs engraved with the image of tigers was another, representing an _ara militaris_ (a bird of the parrot specie, very large and of brilliant plumage of various colors). I took it for the totem of his wife, MOO, _macaw_; and so it proved to be when later I was able to interpret their ideographic writings. _Kinich-Kakmo_ after her death obtained the honors of the apotheosis; had temples raised to her memory, and was worshipped at Izamal up to the time of the Spanish conquest, according to Landa, Cogolludo and Lizana. Satisfied that I had found the tomb of a great warrior among the Mayas, I resolved to make an excavation, notwithstanding I had no tools or implements proper for such work. After two months of hard toil, after penetrating through three level floors painted with yellow ochre, at last a large stone urn came in sight. It was opened in presence of Colonel D. Daniel Traconis. It contained a small heap of grayish dust over which lay the cover of a terra cotta pot, also painted yellow; a few small ornaments of macre that crumbled to dust on being touched, and a large ball of jade, with a hole pierced in the middle. This ball had at one time been highly polished, but for some cause or other the polish had disappeared from one side. Near, and lower than the urn, was discovered the head of the colossal statue, to-day the best, or one of the best pieces, in the National Museum of Mexico, having been carried thither on board of the gunboat _Libertad_, without my consent, and without any renumeration having even been offered by the Mexican government for my labor, my time and the money spent in the discovery. Close to the chest of the statue was another stone urn much larger than the first. On being uncovered it was found to contain a large",

[Illustration: T]HE blood flows all through the body, carrying good food to every part. It also gathers up from every part the worn-out matter that can no longer be used. By the time it is ready to be sent back by the veins, the blood is no longer pure and red. It is dull and bluish in color, because it is full of impurities. If you look at the veins in your wrist, you will see that they look blue. If all this bad blood goes back to the heart, will the heart have to pump out bad blood next time? No, for the heart has neighbors very near at hand, ready to change the bad blood to pure, red blood again. THE LUNGS. These neighbors are the lungs. They are in the chest on each side of the heart. When you breathe, their little air-cells swell out, or expand, to take in the air. Then they contract again, and the air passes out through your mouth or nose. The lungs must have plenty of fresh air, and plenty of room to work in. [Illustration: _The lungs, heart, and air-passages._] If your clothes are too tight and the lungs do not have room to expand, they can not take in so much air as they should. Then the blood can not be made pure, and the whole body will suffer. For every good breath of fresh air, the lungs take in, they send out one of impure air. In this way, by taking out what is bad, they prepare the blood to go back to the heart pure and red, and to be pumped out through the body again. How the lungs can use the fresh air for doing this good work, you can not yet understand. By and by, when you are older, you will learn more about it. CARE OF THE LUNGS. Do the lungs ever rest? You never stop breathing, not even in",
