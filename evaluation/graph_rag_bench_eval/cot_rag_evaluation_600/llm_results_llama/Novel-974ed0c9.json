At last the crucial time had come. I was the only one left standing. As the school-master stood directly in front of me and said \"Next,\" I could see by the twinkle in his eye that he thought I could correctly spell the word. My countenance had betrayed me. With a clear and distinct voice loud enough to be heard by every one in the room I spelled out \"ph-th-is-ic--phthisic.\" \"Correct,\" said the school-master, and all the scholars looked aghast at my promptness. I shall never forget the kindly smile of the old school-master, as he laid the spelling book upon the teacher's desk, with the quiet remark: \"I told you he could spell.\" I had spelled down four schools, and my reputation as a speller was established. Our school was declared to have furnished the champion speller of the four districts, and ever after my name was not the last one to be called. On my return home I was not compelled to ride under the driver's seat. HALF A CENTURY WITH THE PIONEER PRESS. Pioneer Press, April 18, 1908:--Frank Moore, superintendent of the composing room if the Pioneer Press, celebrated yesterday the fiftieth anniversary of his connection with the paper. A dozen of the old employes of the Pioneer Press entertained Mr. Moore at an informal dinner at Magee's to celebrate the unusual event. Mr. Moore's service on the Pioneer Press, in fact, has been longer than the Pioneer Press itself, for he began his work on one of the newspapers which eventually was merged into the present Pioneer Press. He has held his present position as the head of the composing room for about forty years. Frank Moore was fifteen years old when he came to St. Paul from Tioga county, Pa., where he was born. He came with his brother, George W. Moore, who was one of the owners and managers of the Minnesotian. His brother had been East and brought the boy West with him. Mr. Moore's first view of newspaper work was on the trip up the river to St. Paul. There had been a special election on a bond issue and on the way his brother stopped at the various towns to got the election returns. Mr. Moore went to work for the Minnesotian on April 17, 1858, as a printer's \"devil.\" It is interesting in these days of water works and telegraph to recall that among his duties was to carry water for the office.

He got it from a spring below where the Merchants hotel now stands. Another of his jobs was to meet the boats. Whenever a steamer whistled Mr. Moore ran to the dock to get the bundle of newspapers the boat brought, and hurry with it back to the office. It was from these papers that the editors got the telegraph news of the world. He also was half the carrier staff of the paper. His territory covered all the city above Wabasha street, but as far as he went up the hill was College avenue and Ramsey street was his limit out West Seventh street. There was no St. Paul worth mentioning beyond that. When the Press absorbed the Minnesotian in 1861, Mr. Moore went with it, and when in 1874 the Press and Pioneer were united Mr. Moore stayed with the merged paper. His service has been continuous, excepting during his service as a volunteer in the Civil war. The Pioneer Press, with its antecedents, has been his only interest. While Mr. Moore's service is notable for its length, it is still more notable for the fact that he has grown with the paper, so that to-day at sixty-five he is still filling his important position as efficiently on a large modern newspaper as he filled it as a young man when things in the Northwest, including its newspapers, were in the beginning. Successive managements found that his services always gave full value and recognized in him an employe of unusual loyalty and devotion to the interests of the paper. Successive generations of employes have found him always just the kind of man it is a pleasure to have as a fellow workman.",

After frequent consultations between the leading men of the party and the managers of the two offices, it was arranged that the papers should be consolidated and the name of the paper should be the Minnesotian and Times. It can readily be seen that a marriage contracted under these peculiar circumstances was not likely to produce a prolonged state of connubial felicity. The relations between Foster and Newson were no more cordial under one management than had hitherto existed when the offices were separate. This unhappy situation continued until about the time the legislature adjourned, when the partnership was dissolved. Dr. Foster assumed entire control of the Minnesotian and Maj. Newson was manager of the Times. George W. Moore was associated with Dr. Foster in the publication of the Minnesotian prior to the consolidation, but when the offices separated it was stipulated that Mr. Moore should have the printing of the Journals of the two houses of the legislature as part payment of his share of the business of the late firm of Newson, Moore, Foster & Co., thus entirely severing his relations with the paper he helped to found. After the arrangement was made it was with the greatest difficulty that it was carried into effect, as Orville Brown of Faribault had entered the field as a candidate for state printer and came within a few votes of taking the printing to that village. The Times continued under the management of Mr. Newson until the first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R. Marshall and Thomas F. Slaughter, who started the St. Paul Daily Press with its material. The Press proved to be too much of a competitor for the Minnesotian, and in a short time Dr. Foster was compelled to surrender to its enterprising projectors, they having purchased the entire plant. This ended the rivalry between the two Republican dailies. Dr. Foster and Maj. Newson, some time afterward, received commissions in the volunteer service of the army during the Civil war, and George W. Moore was appointed collector of the port of St. Paul, a position he held for more than twenty years. Does any one remember that St. Paul had a paper called the Daily North Star? The historians of St. Paul and Ramsey county do not seem to ever have chronicled the existence of this sprightly little sheet. During the presidential campaign of 1860 we had two kinds of Democrats--the Douglas and the Breckinridge or administration Democrats. There were only two papers in the state that espoused the cause of Mr. Breckinridge--the Chatfield Democrat and the Henderson Independent--and as they had been designated by the president to publish such portion of the acts of congress as it was customary to print at that",

OTHER PRINTERS IN THE CIVIL WAR. Capt. Henry C. Coates was foreman of the job department of the Pioneer office. He was an officer in the Pioneer Guards, and when the war broke out was made a lieutenant in the First regiment, was in all the battles of that famous organization up to and including Gettysburg; was commander of the regiment for some time after the battle. After the war he settled in Philadelphia, where he now resides. Jacob J. Noah at one time set type, with Robert Bonner. He was elected clerk of the supreme court at the first election of state officers; was captain of Company K Second Minnesota regiment, but resigned early in the war and moved to New York City, his former home. Frank H. Pratt was an officer in the Seventh regiment and served through the war. He published a paper at Taylor's Falls at one time. After the war he was engaged in the mercantile business in St. Paul. John C. Devereux was foreman of the old Pioneer and was an officer in the Third regiment, and still resides in the city. Jacob T. McCoy was an old-time typo and worked in all the St. Paul offices before and after the rebellion. Mr. McCoy was a fine singer and his voice was always heard at typographical gatherings. He enlisted as private in the Second Minnesota and served more than four years, returning as first lieutenant. He now resides in Meadeville, Pa. Martin Williams was printer, editor, reporter and publisher, both before and after the war. He was quartermaster of the Second Minnesota cavalry. Robert P. Slaughter and his brother, Thomas Slaughter, were both officers in the volunteer service and just previous to the rebellion were engaged in the real estate business. Edward Richards was foreman of the Pioneer and Minnesotian before the war and foreman of the old St. Paul Press after the war. He enlisted during the darkest days of the rebellion in the Eighth regiment and served in the dual capacity of correspondent and soldier. No better soldier ever left the state. He was collector of customs of the port of St. Paul under the administration of Presidents Garfield and Arthur, and later was on the editorial staff of the Pioneer Press.

But quicker than a flash I was raised to the shoulders of the awaiting crowd and walked on their heads to the counting room window, where I sold what few papers I had as rapidly as I could hand them out. As soon as the magnitude of the news got circulated cheer after cheer rent the air, and cannon, anvils, firecrackers and everything that would make a noise was brought into requisition, and before sundown St. Paul had celebrated the greatest Fourth of July in its history. I arrived in St. Paul on the morning of the 17th of April, 1858, and Immediately commenced work on the Daily Minnesotian, my brother, Geo. W. Moore, being part owner and manager of the paper. I had not been at work long before I learned what a \"scoop\" was. Congress had passed a bill admitting Minnesota into the Union, but as there was no telegraphic communication with Washington it required two or three days for the news to reach the state. The Pioneer, Minnesotian and Times were morning papers, and were generally printed the evening before. It so happened that the news of the admission of Minnesota was brought to St. Paul by a passenger on a late boat and the editors of the Pioneer accidentally heard of the event and published the same on the following morning, thus scooping the other two papers. The Minnesotian got out an extra and sent it around to their subscribers and they thought they had executed a great stroke of enterprise. It was not long before I became familiar with the method of obtaining news and I was at the levee on the arrival of every boat thereafter. I could tell every boat by its whistle, and there was no more scoops 'till the telegraph line was completed in the summer of 1860. During the latter part of the Civil war the daily newspapers began to expand, and have ever since kept fully abreast of the requirements of our rapidly increasing population. The various papers were printed on single-cylinder presses until about 1872, when double-cylinders were introduced. In 1876 the first turtle-back press was brought to the city, printing four pages at one time. In 1880 the different offices introduced stereotyping, and in 1892 linotype type-setting machines were installed. The next great advance will probably be some system of photography that will entirely dispense with the work of the printer and proofreader. Who knows? THE FIVE MILLION LOAN ELECTION.

They could be plainly seen frantically calling for help. There was no possible way to reach them. Finally Charles Mueller jumped out on the window sill and made a leap for life, and an instant later he was followed by his brother.

It was called Irvine hall, and at one time Melodeon hall. Dan Emmet had a minstrel company at this hall during the years 1857 and 1858, and an excellent company it was, too. There was Frank Lombard, the great baritone; Max Irwin, bones, and one of the funniest men who ever sat on the stage; Johnny Ritter, female impersonator and clog dancer, and a large number of others. Frank Lombard afterward achieved a national reputation as one of the best baritone singers in the country. He was much sought after for patriotic entertainments and political conventions.
