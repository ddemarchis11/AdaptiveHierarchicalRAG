The apparatus can be easily carried on a man's back, and on condition of water, even of the worst quality, being obtainable, good drinking and cooking water is insured. M. De Rougaumond, a young scientific writer, has just published an interesting volume on the invention. I was able yesterday to verify his statements, for I saw cider made, a pump set in motion, and coffee made--in short, the calorific action of the sun superseding that of fuel. The apparatus, no doubt, has not yet reached perfection, but as it is it would enable the soldier in India or Egypt to procure in the field good water and to cook his food rapidly. The invention is of especial importance to England just now, but even when the Egyptian question is settled the Indian troops might find it of inestimable value. Red tape should for once be disregarded, and a competent commission forthwith sent to 30 Rue d'Assas, with instructions to report immediately, for every minute saved may avoid suffering for Englishmen fighting abroad for their country. I may, of course, be mistaken, but a commission would decide, and if the apparatus is good the slightest delay in its adoption would be deplorable.--_Paris Correspondence London Times_. HOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN. [Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia.] By PROFESSOR L. M. HAUPT. INTRODUCTORY. The discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been of inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters, and the explorer over desert wastes. In these, its legitimate uses, the needle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate determination of permanent boundary lines have proven very unsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and even death. For these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to dispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle in surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of traversing from a true meridian. This method, however, involves a greater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are generally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be readily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application in practice. Much has been written upon the various methods of determining, the true meridian, but it is so intimately related to the determination of latitude and time, and these latter in turn upon the fixing of a true meridian, that the novice can find neither beginning nor end. When to these difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction, instrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the probable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he",

The result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for ordinary purposes. The time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens. The refraction is _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by looking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude. Thus, if the observer's altitude should be 40 deg. 39' the nearest refraction 01' 07\", should be subtracted from 40 deg. 37' 00\", leaving 40 deg. 37' 53\" for the latitude. TO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS. As we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the latitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the required azimuth. For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical triangle, Z S P, Fig. 4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the north pole, and S is Polaris. In this triangle we have given the polar distance, P S = 10 deg. 19' 13\"; the angle at S = 90 deg.; and the distance Z P, being the complement of the latitude as found above, or 90 deg.--L. Substituting these in the formula for the azimuth, we will have sin. Z = sin. P S / sin P Z or sin. of Polar distance / sin. of co-latitude, from which, by assuming different values for the co-latitude, we compute the following table: AZIMUTH TABLE FOR POINTS BETWEEN 26 deg. and 50 deg.

Take the reading of the vertical arc and the result will be the observed altitude. [Footnote 1: A sextant and artificial horizon may be used to find the _altitude_ of a star. In this case the observed angle must be divided by 2.] ANOTHER METHOD. It is a little more accurate to find the altitude by taking the complement of the observed zenith distance, if the vertical arc has sufficient range. This is done by pointing first to Polaris when at its highest (or lowest) point, reading the vertical arc, turning the horizontal limb half way around, and the telescope over to get another reading on the star, when the difference of the two readings will be the _double_ zenith distance, and _half_ of this subtracted from 90 deg. will be the required altitude. The less the time intervening between these two pointings, the more accurate the result will be. Having now found the altitude, correct it for refraction by subtracting from it the amount opposite the observed altitude, as given in the refraction table, and the result will be the latitude. The observer must now wait about six hours until the star is at its western elongation, or may postpone further operations for some subsequent night. In the meantime he will take from the azimuth table the amount given for his date and latitude, now determined, and if his observation is to be made on the western elongation, he may turn it off on his instrument, so that when moved to zero, _after_ the observation, the telescope will be brought into the meridian or turned to the right, and a stake set by means of a lantern or plummet lamp. [Illustration] It is, of course, unnecessary to make this correction at the time of observation, for the angle between any terrestrial object and the star may be read and the correction for the azimuth of the star applied at the surveyor's convenience. It is always well to check the accuracy of the work by an observation upon the other elongation before putting in permanent meridian marks, and care should be taken that they are not placed near any local attractions. The meridian having been established, the magnetic variation or declination may readily be found by setting an instrument on the meridian and noting its bearing as given by the needle. If, for example, it should be north 5 deg. _east_, the variation is west, because the north end of the needle is _west_ of the meridian, and _vice versa_. _Local time_ may also be readily found by observing the instant when the sun's center[1] crosses the line, and correcting it for the equation of time as given above--the result is the true or mean solar",

When to these difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction, instrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the probable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he learns that time may be sidereal, mean solar, local, Greenwich, or Washington, and he is referred to an ephemeris and table of logarithms for data, he becomes lost in \"confusion worse confounded,\" and gives up in despair, settling down to the conviction that the simple method of compass surveying is the best after all, even if not the most accurate. Having received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I have thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the method of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently clear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make use of such information. This will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with the DEFINITIONS. The _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all celestial objects are projected. Its radius is infinite. The _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves. The _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the earth, or of the celestial sphere. A _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing through the axis. All meridians are therefore north and south lines passing through the poles. From these definitions it follows that if there were a star exactly at the pole it would only be necessary to set up an instrument and take a bearing to it for the meridian. Such not being the case, however, we are obliged to take some one of the near circumpolar stars as our object, and correct the observation according to its angular distance from the meridian at the time of observation. For convenience, the bright star known as Ursae Minoris or Polaris, is generally selected. This star apparently revolves about the north pole, in an orbit whose mean radius is 1 deg. 19' 13\",[1] making the revolution in 23 hours 56 minutes. [Footnote 1: This is the codeclination as given in the Nautical Almanac. The mean value decreases by about 20 seconds each year.] During this time it must therefore cross the meridian twice, once above the pole and once below; the former is called the _upper_, and the latter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_. It must also pass through the points farthest east and west from the meridian. The former is called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_. An observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points, or at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too complicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.

It also shows that the azimuth of Polaris at any one point of observation decreases slightly from year to year. This is due to the increase in declination, or decrease in the star's polar distance. At 26 deg. north latitude, this annual decrease in the azimuth is about 22\", while at 50 deg. north, it is about 30\". As the variation in azimuth for each degree of latitude is small, the table is only computed for the even numbered degrees; the intermediate values being readily obtained by interpolation. We see also that an error of a few minutes of latitude will not affect the result in finding the meridian, e.g., the azimuth at 40 deg. north latitude is 1 deg. 43' 21\", that at 41 deg. would be 1 deg. 44' 56\", the difference (01' 35\") being the correction for one degree of latitude between 40 deg. and 41 deg. Or, in other words, an error of one degree in finding one's latitude would only introduce an error in the azimuth of one and a half minutes. With ordinary care the probable error of the latitude as determined from the method already described need not exceed a few minutes, making the error in azimuth as laid off on the arc of an ordinary transit graduated to single minutes, practically zero.
