  "gold_answer": "Kynance Cove, which includes Kynance and the feature Devil's Throat, is in Cornwall.",
  "llm_answer": "The connection between Kynance and Cornwall as established by the narrative chains is that Kynance is a location on the coast of Cornwall, and the narrative describes the journey of the characters to Kynance Cove, which is illustrated in the book. The text also mentions the Lizard Lights, which are visible from Kynance, and the Devil's Throat and Hell's Mouth, which are locations near Kynance. The narrative also describes the scenery and the people of Cornwall, including John Curgenven, a fisherman who guides the characters to Kynance.",

      "text": "pleasure in watching them enjoy themselves, our interest in studying human nature in the abstract, nay, even the picturesqueness of the charming moonlight scene, could not tempt us to stay. We paused a minute, then put our fingers in our ears and fled. Gradually those fearful sounds melted away into distance, and left us to the silence of moonshine, and the sight, now grown familiar, but never less beautiful, of the far-gleaming Lizard Lights. DAY THE SEVENTH John Curgenven had said last night, with his air of tender patronising, half regal, half paternal, which we declared always reminded us of King Arthur--\"Ladies, whenever you settle to go to Kynance, I'll take you.\" And sure enough there he stood, at eight in the morning, quite a picture, his cap in one hand, a couple of fishes dangling from the other--he had brought them as a present, and absolutely refused to be paid--smiling upon us at our breakfast, as benignly as did the sun. He came to say that he was at our service till 10 A.M.; when he had an engagement. Our countenances fell. We did not like venturing in strange and dangerous ground, or rather sea, without our protector. But this was our last chance, and such a lovely day. \"You won't come to any harm, ladies,\" said the consoling John. \"I'll take you by a short cut across the down, much better than the cliff. You can't possibly miss your way: it'll lead you straight to Kynance, and then you go down a steep path to the Cove. You'll have plenty of time before the tide comes in to see everything.\" \"And to bathe?\" \"Oh yes, miss, there's the Drawing-room, the Dining-room, and the Kitchen--all capital caves close together; I wouldn't advise you to swim out far, though. And keep a sharp look out for the tide--it runs in pretty fast.\" \"And the scrambling?\" \"Oh, you can easy get on Asparagus Island, miss; it's quite safe. Only don't try the Devil's Throat--or Hell's Mouth, as some folk call it.\" Neither name was inviting; but studying our guide-books, we thought we could manage even without our friend. So, long ere the dew was dried on the sunshiny down, we all started off together, Curgenven slackening his quick active steps--very light and most enviably active for a man of his years--to accommodate us, and conversing courteously with us all the way.

If I was to go direct and tell John Curgenven to have a boat ready at Church Cove, and we was to start at nine instead of ten, and drive there, the carriage might wait while you rowed to the caves and back; we should still reach Helstone by dinner-time, and Marazion before dark.\" \"We'll do it!\" was the unanimous resolve. And at this addition to his work Charles looked actually pleased! So--all was soon over, our easy packing done, our bill paid--a very small one--our goodnights said to the kindly handmaid, Esther, who hoped we would come back again some time, and promised to keep the artistic mural decorations of our little parlour in memory of us. My young folks went to bed, and then, a little before midnight, when all the house was quiet, I put a shawl over my head, unlatched the innocent door--no bolts or bars at the Lizard--and went out into the night. What a night it was!--mild as summer, clear as day: the full moon sailing aloft in an absolutely cloudless sky. Not a breath, not a sound--except the faint thud-thud of the in-coming waves, two miles off, at Kynance, the outline of which, and of the whole coast, was distinctly visible. A silent earth, lying under a silent heaven. Looking up, one felt almost like a disembodied soul, free to cleave through infinite space and gain--what? Is it human or divine, this ceaseless longing after something never attained, this craving after the eternal life, which, if fully believed in, fully understood, would take all the bitterness out of this life? And yet, that knowledge is not given. But so much is given, and all given is so infinitely good, except where we ourselves turn it into evil, that surely more, and better, will be given to us by and by. And so, to bed--to bed! Those only truly enjoy life who fear not death: who can say of the grave as if it were their bed: \"I will lay me down in peace and take my rest, for it is Thou only, O God, who makest me to dwell in safety.\" DAY THE NINTH And our last at the Lizard, which a week ago had been to us a mere word or dot in a map; now we carried away from it a living human interest in everything and everybody. Esther bade us a cordial farewell: Mrs. Curgenven, standing at the door of her serpentine shop, repeated the good wishes, and informed us that John and his boat had already started for Church Cove. As we drove through the bright little Lizard Town, and past the Church of",

[Illustration: KYNANCE COVE, CORNWALL.] \"Ower the muir amang the heather\" have I tramped many a mile in bonnie Scotland, but this Cornish moor and Cornish heather were quite different. As different as the Cornishman with his bright, frank face, and his mixture of British honesty and Gallic courtesy, from the Scotch peasant--equally worthy, but sometimes just a trifle \"dour.\" John had plenty to say for himself, and said it well, with a quiet independence that there was no mistaking; never forgetting meanwhile to stop and offer a helping hand over every bit of rough road, puddle, or bog. He gave us a vivid picture of winter life at the Lizard: when the little community has to hybernate, like the squirrels and field-mice, upon its summer savings. \"Sometimes we don't earn a halfpenny for weeks and months, and then if we've got nothing to fall back upon it's a bad job, you see, ma'am.\" I asked him if much money went for drink; they seemed to me a remarkably sober set at the Lizard. \"Yes, I think we are; we're obliged to be; we can't spend money at the public-house, for we've got none to spend. I'm no teetotaller myself,\" added John boldly. \"I don't dislike a glass of beer now and then, if I can afford it, and when I can't afford it I can do without it, and if I do take it I always know when to stop.\" Ay, that is the crucial test--the knowing when to stop. It is this which makes all the difference between a good man and a villain, a wise man and a fool. Self-control--a quality which, guided by conscience and common sense, is the best possession of any human being. And looking at the honest fisherman, one felt pretty sure he had his share of it. \"Now I must leave you, ladies,\" said he, a great deal sooner than we wished, for we much liked talking to him. \"My time's nearly up, and I mustn't keep my gentleman waiting; he goes out in my boat every day, and has been a good friend to me. The road's straight before you, ladies; and there's another party just ahead of you. Follow the track, and you'll soon be at Kynance. It's a lovely day for the Cove, and I hope you'll enjoy yourselves.\" John bared his grey head, with a salutation worthy of some old knight of the Round Table, and then strode back, in double-quick time, as active and upright as any young fellow of twenty-five, across the level down.

Modern ghosts, too, exist, decidedly more alarming. \"Look up there, ladies, that green <DW72> is Pistol Meadow. Nobody likes to walk there after dark. Other things walk as well.\" \"What things?\" \"Two hundred and more of foreign sailors, whose ship went to pieces in the little cove below. They're buried under the green mounds you see. Out of a crew of seven hundred only two men were washed ashore alive, and they were in irons, which the captain had put on them because they said he was going too near in shore. It was called Pistol Meadow because most of 'em were found with pistols in their hands, which may have been true or may not, since it happened more than a hundred years ago. However, there are the green mounds, you see, and Lizard folk don't much like passing the place after dark.\" \"But you?\" John Curgenven smiled. \"Oh, us and the coast-guards! Us goes anywhere, at all hours, and never meets nothing. D'ye see those white marks all along the coast every few yards? They're rocks, kept white-washed, to guide the men of dark nights between here and Kynance. It's a ticklish path, when all's as black as pitch, with a stiff wind blowing.\" I should think it was! One almost shuddered at the idea, and then felt proud of the steady heads and cool courage of these coast-guard men--always the pick of the service, true Englishmen, fearless and faithful--the business of whose whole lives is to save other lives--that is, now that smuggling has abated, and those dreadful stories once current all along the coast of Cornwall have become mostly legends of the past. No tales of wreckers, or of fights between smugglers and revenue officers, reached our ears, but the stories of shipwrecks were endless. Every winter, and many times through the winter, some ghastly tragedy had happened. Every half-mile along this picturesque shore was recorded the place where some good ship went to pieces, often with the brief addendum, \"all hands lost.\" \"The sun's just setting. Look out for the Lizard Lights,\" called out Charles, who sat in the bow of the boat in faithful attendance upon his \"ladies,\"--another Knight of the Round Table in humble life--we met many such in Cornwall. \"Look! There they are.\" And sure enough, the instant the sun's last spark was quenched in the sea, into which he dropped like a red round ball, out burst two substitute suns, and very fair substitutes too, making the poor little moon in the east of no importance whatever.

      "text": "translation. As one would naturally infer from the title of Schummel’s fiction, the Sentimental Journey is more constantly drawn upon as a source of ideas, motifs, expression, and method, than Tristram Shandy, but the allusions to Sterne’s earlier book, and the direct adaptations from it are both numerous and generous. This fact has not been recognized by the critics, and is not an easy inference from the contemporary reviews. The book is the result of an immediate impulse to imitation felt irresistibly on the reading of Sterne’s narrative. That the critics and readers of that day treated with serious consideration the efforts of a callow youth of twenty or twenty-one in this direction is indicative either of comparative vigor of execution, or of prepossession of the critical world in favor of the literary genre,--doubtless of both. Schummel confesses that the desire to write came directly after the book had been read. “I had just finished reading it,” he says, “and Heaven knows with what pleasure, every word from ‘as far as this matter is concerned’ on to ‘I seized the hand of the lady’s maid,’ were imprinted in my soul with small invisible letters.” The characters of the Journey stood “life-size in his very soul.” Involuntarily his inventive powers had sketched several plans for a continuation, releasing Yorick from the hand of the _fille de chambre_. But what he attempts is not a continuation but a German parallel. In the outward events of his story, in the general trend of its argument, Schummel does not depend upon either Shandy or the Journey: the hero’s circumstances are in general not traceable to the English model, but, spasmodically, the manner of narration and the nature of the incidents are quite slavishly copied. A complete summary of the thread of incident on which the various sentimental adventures, whimsical speculations and digressions are hung, can be dispensed with: it is only necessary to note instances where connection with Sterne as a model can be established. Schummel’s narrative is often for many successive pages absolutely straightforward and simple, unbroken by any attempt at Shandean buoyancy, and unblemished by overwrought sentiment. At the pausing places he generally indulges in Sternesque quibbling. A brief analysis of the first volume, with especial reference to the appropriation of Yorick features, will serve to show the extent of imitation, and the nature of the method. In outward form the Sentimental Journey is copied. The volume is not divided into chapters, but there are named divisions: there is also Yorick-like repetition of section-headings. Naturally the author attempts at the very beginning to strike a note distinctly suggesting Sterne: “Is he dead, the old cousin?” are the first words of the volume, uttered by the hero on receipt of the news,",
