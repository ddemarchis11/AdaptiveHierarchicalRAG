  "llm_answer": "Diary Entry - The Day the Boat Ventured into My Cave\n\nDear Diary,\n\nToday was a day I will never forget. A boat ventured into my cave, and I must say, it was quite an experience. I am a launce, a fish found at Lizard, and my home is a beautiful sea cave. The boatmen, two men with a sturdy boat, took my friends on a tour of the cave. They were excited to see the wonders of the underwater world, and I must admit, I was a bit curious myself.\n\nAs the boat entered the cave, I swam alongside, watching the commotion. The boatmen expertly navigated the narrow entrance, and we glided deeper into the cave. The darkness was almost palpable, but the sound of the waves crashing against the walls was a constant reminder of the power of the sea.\n\nMy friends were a bit apprehensive at first, but as we glided further into the cave, they began to marvel at the beauty of the underwater world. The walls of the cave were tinted with colors - rose-pink, rich dark brown, and purple. It was a sight to behold.\n\nBut as we ventured deeper, the boatmen warned us that the cave was not safe for humans. The walls were narrow, and the waves crashed against them with great force. My friends were a bit scared, but they were also fascinated by the experience.\n\nIn the end, they decided to leave the cave, but not before one of them begged to stay for just a few more minutes. I must admit, I was a bit disappointed when they left, but I was also relieved that they were safe.\n\nAs I swam back to my hiding place, I couldn't help but think about the experience we had just shared. It was a day I will never forget, and I am grateful to have been a part of it.\n\nYours truly,\nA Launce",

You are apt either to chop him right in two, or miss him altogether, when off he wriggles in the sand and disappears. My young people say it requires a practised hand and a peculiar twist of the wrist, to have any success at all in launce fishing. It can only be done on moonlight nights--the full moon and a day or two after--and they are out half the night. They go about barefoot, which is much safer than soaked shoes and stockings. About midnight they light a fire on the sand, cook all the fish they have caught, and have a grand supper, as they had last night. They came home as merry as crickets about two o'clock this morning. Perhaps you might not have noticed what a wonderful moonlight night it was?\" I had; but it would not have occurred to me to spend it in standing for hours up to the knees in salt water, catching unfortunate fish. However, tastes differ, and launce-fishing may be a prime delight to some people; so I faithfully chronicle it, and the proper mode of pursuing it, as one of the attractions at the Lizard. I am not aware that it is practised at any other part of the Cornish coast, nor can I say whether or not it was a pastime of King Arthur and his Knights. One cannot imagine Sir Tristram or Sir Launcelot occupied in spearing a small sand-eel. The bathing at Housel Cove was delightful as ever. And afterwards we saw that very rare and beautiful sight, a perfect solar rainbow. Not the familiar bow of Noah, but a great luminous circle round the sun, like the halo often seen round the moon, extending over half the sky; yellow at first, then gradually assuming faint prismatic tints. This colouring, though never so bright as the ordinary arched rainbow, was wonderfully tender and delicate. We stood a long time watching it, till at last it melted slowly out of the sky, leaving behind a sense of mystery, as of something we had never seen before and might never see again in all our lives. It was a lovely day, bright and warm as midsummer, tempting us to some distant excursion; but we had decided to investigate the Lizard Lights. We should have been content to take them for granted, in their purely poetical phase, as we had watched them night after night. But some of us were blessed with scientific relatives, who would have despised us utterly if we had spent a whole week at the Lizard and never gone to see the Lizard Lights. So we felt bound to do our duty, and admire, if we could not understand. Which we certainly did not. I chronicle with shame that the careful and courteous explanations",

Directly after breakfast--and we are people who never vary from our eight o'clock breakfast, so that we always see the world in its early morning brightness and freshness--we went \"Brushing with hasty steps the dew away,\" along the fields, which led down to Housel or Househole Cove. Before us, clear in the sunshine, rose the fine headland of Penolver, and the green <DW72>s of the amphitheatre of Belidden, supposed to be the remains of a Druidical temple. That, and the chair of Belidden, a recess in the rock, whence there is a splendid view, with various archaeological curiosities, true or traditionary, we ought to have examined, I know. But--we didn't do it. Some of us were content to rejoice in the general atmosphere of beauty and peace without minute investigation, and some of us were so eminently practical that \"a good bathe\" appeared more important than all the poetry and archaeology in the world. So we wandered slowly on, rejoicing at having the place all to ourselves, when we came suddenly upon a tall black figure intently watching three other black figures, or rather dots, which were climbing slowly over Penolver. It was our clerical friend of Kynance; with whom, in the natural and right civility of holiday-makers, we exchanged a courteous good morning. [Illustration: THE LION ROCKS--A SEA IN WHICH NOTHING CAN LIVE.] \"Yes, those are my girls up on the cliff there. They have been bathing, and are now going to walk to Cadgwith.\" \"Then nobody fell into the Devil's Throat at Kynance? They all came back to you with whole limbs?\" \"Yes,\" said he smiling, \"and they went again for another long walk in the afternoon. At night, when it turned out to be such splendid moonlight, they actually insisted on going launce-fishing. Of course you know about launce-fishing?\" I pleaded my utter ignorance of that noble sport. \"Oh, it is _the_ thing at the Lizard. My boys--and girls too--consider it the best fun going. The launce is a sort of sand-eel peculiar to these coasts. It swims about all day, and at night burrows in the sand just above the waterline, where, when the moon shines on it, you can trace the silvery gleam of the creature. So you stand up to your ankles on wet sand, with a crooked iron spear which you dart in and hook him up, keeping your left hand free to seize him with.\" \"Easy fishing,\" said I, with a certain pity for the sand-eel. \"Not so easy as appears.

Its high-vaulted roof and sides were tinted all colours--rose-pink, rich dark brown, and purple. The entrance was wide enough to admit a boat, but it gradually narrowed into impenetrable darkness. How far inland it goes no one can tell, as it could only be investigated by swimming, a rather dangerous experiment. Boats venture as far as the daylight goes; and it is a favourite trick of the boatman suddenly to fire off a pistol, which reverberates like thunder through the mysterious gloom of the cave. A solemn place; an awful place, some of us thought, as we rowed in, and out again, into the sunshiny open sea. Which we had now got used to; and it was delicious to go dancing like a feather up and down, trusting to John Curgenven's stout arm and fearless, honest face. We felt sad to think this would be our last sight of him and of the magnificent Lizard coast. But the minutes were lessening, and we had some way still to row. Also to land, which meant a leap between the waves upon slippery sea-weedy rocks. In silent dread I watched my children accomplish this feat, and then-- Well, it is over, and I sit here writing these details. But I would not do it again, not even for the pleasure of revisiting Dolor Ugo and having a row with John Curgenven. Honest fellow! he looked relieved when he saw \"the old lady\" safe on _terra firma_, and we left him waving adieux, as he \"rocked in his boat in the bay.\" May his stout arms and kindly heart long remain to him! May his summer tourists be many and his winter shipwrecks few! I am sure he will always do his duty, and see that other people do theirs, or, like the proverbial Cornishmen, he \"will know the reason why.\" Charles was ready; waiting patiently in front of a blacksmith's shop. But, alas! fate had overtaken us in the shape of an innocent leak in John Curgenven's boat; nothing, doubtless, to him, who was in the habit of baling it out with his boots, and then calmly putting them on again, but a little inconvenient to us. To drive thirty miles with one's garments soaked up to the knees was not desirable. There was a cottage close by, whence came the gleam of a delicious fire and the odour of ironing clothes. We went in: the mistress, evidently a laundress, advanced and offered to dry us--which she did, chattering all the while in the confidential manner of country folks.

We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel we found a party who had just returned from visiting some sea-caves beyond Tintagel, which they declared were \"the finest things they had found in Cornwall.\" It was a lovely calm day, and it was our last day. A few hours of it alone remained. Should we use them? We might never be here again. And, I think, the looser grows one's grasp of life, the greater is one's longing to make the most of it, to see all we can see of this wonderful, beautiful world. So, after a hasty meal, we found ourselves once more down at Porth Hern, seeking a boat and man--alas! not John Curgenven--under whose guidance we might brave the stormy deep. It was indeed stormy! No sooner had we rounded the rock, than the baby waves of the tiny bay grew into hills and valleys, among which our boat went dancing up and down like a sea-gull! \"Ay, there's some sea on, there always is here, but we'll be through it presently,\" indifferently said the elder of the two boatmen; and plied his oars, as, I think, only these Cornish boatmen can do, talking all the while. He pointed out a slate quarry, only accessible from the sea, unless the workmen liked to be let down by ropes, which sometimes had to be done. We saw them moving about like black emmets among the clefts of the rocks, and heard plainly above the sound of the sea the click of their hammers. Strange, lonely, perilous work it must be, even in summer. In winter-- \"Oh, they're used to it; we're all used to it,\" said our man, who was intelligent enough, though nothing equal to John Curgenven. \"Many a time I've got sea-fowls' eggs on those rocks there,\" pointing to a cliff which did not seem to hold footing for a fly. \"We all do it. The gentry buy them, and we're glad of the money. Dangerous?--yes, rather; but one must earn one's bread, and it's not so bad when you take to it young.\" Nevertheless, I think I shall never look at a collection of sea-birds' eggs without a slight shudder, remembering those awful cliffs. \"Here you are, ladies, and the sea's down a bit, as I said. Hold on, mate, the boat will go right into the cave.\" And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking",

Which resulted in our carrying away with us the biggest bunches in the whole vinery, as well as a quantity of rosy apples, stuffed into every available pocket and bag. \"Nonsense, nonsense,\" was the answer to vain remonstrances. \"D'ye think I wouldn't give the best of everything I had to your family? and so would my missis too. How your father used to laugh at me about my little maid! But he understood it for all that. Oh yes, I'm glad I came home. And now your father and your uncle are home too, and perhaps some day they'll come to see me down here--wouldn't it be a proud day for me! You'll tell them so?\" It was touching, and rare as touching, this passionate personal fidelity. It threw us back, at least such of us as were sentimentally inclined, upon that something in Cornish nature which found its exposition in Arthur and his faithful knights, down to \"bold Sir Bedevere,\" and apparently, is still not lost in Cornwall. With a sense of real regret, feeling that it would be long ere we might meet his like--such shrewd simplicity, earnest enthusiasm, and exceeding faithfulness--we bade good-bye to the honest man; leaving him and his wife standing at their garden-gate, an elderly Adam and Eve, desiring nothing outside their own little paradise. Which of us could say more, or as much? Gratefully we \"talked them over,\" as we drove on through the pretty country round Helstone--inland country; for we had no time to go and see the Loe Pool, a small lake, divided from the sea by a bar of sand. This is supposed to be the work of the Cornwall man-demon, Tregeagle; and periodically cut through, with solemn ceremonial, by the Mayor of Helstone, when the \"meeting of the waters,\" fresh and salt, is said to be an extremely curious sight. But we did not see it, nor yet Nonsloe House, close by, which is held by the tenure of having to provide a boat and nets whenever the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Cornwall wishes to fish in the Loe Pool. A circumstance which has never happened yet, certainly! Other curiosities _en route_ we also missed, the stones of Tremenkeverne, half a ton each, used as missiles in a notable fight between two saints, St. Just of the Land's End, and St. Keverne of the Lizard, and still lying in a field to prove the verity of the legend.

Hold on, mate, the boat will go right into the cave.\" And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them; while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from which no one could ever hope to come out alive. \"I don't like this at all,\" said a small voice. \"Hadn't we better get out again?\" practically suggested another. But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to return; and begged for \"only five minutes\" in that wonderful place, compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as nothing. They were beautiful, but this was terrible. Yet with its terror was mingled an awful delight. \"Give me but five, nay, two minutes more!\" \"Very well, just as you choose,\" was the response of meek despair. So of course, Poetry yielded. The boatmen were told to row on into daylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic overhanging cliffs permitted. And never, never, never in this world shall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave. But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself on my memory with an almost painful vividness. However, I promised not to regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not. I did see it, for just a glimpse; and that will serve. Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in quiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building dating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff, and with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude Haven on the other. Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild September sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited country which lie between Tintagel and Launceston. In the midst of it, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round and pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about half-a-mile off. \"There, ladies, that's King Arthur's grave.\" The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of.
