  "gold_answer": "Georgiana Tidman uses the nickname George Tidd, and Augustin is also known as the Dean, showing the use of alternate identities among the characters.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative reveals the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters, specifically through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" and Augustin's role as the Dean.\n\nGeorgiana Tidman uses the nickname \"George Tidd\" as a reference to her racing name. This is evident when she says, \"Trust George Tidd for setting things quite square in a palace or a puddle\" and later when she produces her pocket-handkerchief with her racing colors, \"crimson and black diamonds.\" This nickname is used to distinguish her from her more refined and proper identity as Georgiana Tidman, the Dean's sister.\n\nAugustin, the Dean, uses the nickname \"Gus\" when referring to himself, which is evident when Georgiana says, \"Gus, I don't like your looks, I shall let the Vet see you in the morning.\" This nickname is used to convey a sense of familiarity and informality, which contrasts with the Dean's more formal and proper identity.\n\nThe use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters serves to reveal their personalities and relationships with one another. Georgiana's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" suggests that she is a free-spirited and unconventional individual who is not afraid to take risks and challenge social norms. Augustin's use of the nickname \"Gus\" suggests that he is a more informal and relaxed individual who is willing to let his guard down around those he trusts.\n\nThe impact of this on the unfolding of their personal and social identities is significant. Georgiana's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" allows her to maintain a sense of independence and autonomy, which is essential to her identity as a racing enthusiast and a free spirit. Augustin's use of the nickname \"Gus\" allows him to connect with Georgiana on a more personal level, which is essential to their relationship as siblings.\n\nOverall, the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters serves to add depth and complexity to the narrative, revealing their personalities, relationships, and identities in a more nuanced and subtle way.",

[_SHEBA laughs._ THE DEAN. [_Reprovingly._] Toy-child! GEORGIANA. Trust George Tidd for setting things quite square in a palace or a puddle. THE DEAN. George Tidd! Who is George Tidd? GEORGIANA. I am George Tidd--that was my racing name. Ask after George Tidd at Newmarket--they'll tell you all about me. My colors were crimson and black diamonds. There you are. [_Producing her pocket-handkerchief, which is crimson and black._ THE DEAN. Dear me! Very interesting! Georgiana, my dear. One moment, children. [_The girls go into the Library._ THE DEAN. [_Tapping the handkerchief._] I understand distinctly from your letter that all this is finally abandoned? GEORGIANA. Worse luck! They'll never see my colors at the post again! THE DEAN. And the contemplation of sport generally as a mental distraction----? GEORGIANA. Oh, yes--I dare say you'll manage to wean me from that, too, in time. THE DEAN. In time! Well, but--Georgiana!

At what time do we feed, Augustin? THE DEAN. There is luncheon at one o'clock. GEORGIANA. Right. The air here is so fresh I sha'n't be sorry to get my nose-bag on. [_She stalks out, accompanied by the girls._ THE DEAN. My sister, Georgiana--my widowed sister, Georgiana. Dear me, I am quite disturbed. Surely, surely the serene atmosphere of the Deanery will work a change. It must! It must! If not, what a grave mistake I have made. Good gracious! No, no, I won't think of it! Still, it is a little unfortunate that poor Georgiana should arrive here on the very eve of these terrible races at St. Marvells. _BLORE enters with a card._ THE DEAN. Who is it, Blore? [_Reading the card._] \"Sir Tristram Mardon.\" Dear, dear! Certainly, Blore, certainly. [_BLORE goes out._] Mardon--why, Mardon and I haven't met since Oxford.

Yes, sir; but I hear they've just sent into Durnstone hasking for the Military to watch the ruins in case of another houtbreak. It'll stop the wicked Ball at the Hathanaeum, it will!

With that number I have the mournful pleasure of enrolling myself. GEORGIANA. When's the settling day? THE DEAN. Eh? GEORGIANA. When will you have to fork out? THE DEAN.
