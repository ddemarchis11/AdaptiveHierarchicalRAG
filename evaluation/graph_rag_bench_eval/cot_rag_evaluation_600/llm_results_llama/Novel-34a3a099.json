      "text": "however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is changing the starch into sugar. All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva may be able to mix with it. Otherwise, the starch may not be changed; and if one part of your body neglects its work, another part will have more than its share to do. That is hardly fair. If you swallow your food in a hurry and do not let the saliva do its work, the stomach will have extra work. But it will find it hard to do more than its own part, and, perhaps, will complain. It can not speak in words; but will by aching, and that is almost as plain as words. SWALLOWING. Next to the chewing, comes the swallowing. Is there any thing wonderful about that? We have two passages leading down our throats. One is to the lungs, for breathing; the other, to the stomach, for swallowing. Do you wonder why the food does not sometimes go down the wrong way? The windpipe leading to the lungs is in front of the other tube. It has at its top a little trap-door. This opens when we breathe and shuts when we swallow, so that the food slips over it safely into the passage behind, which leads to the stomach. If you try to speak while you have food in your mouth, this little door has to open, and some bit of food may slip in. The windpipe will not pass it to the lungs, but tries to force it back. Then we say the food chokes us. If the windpipe can not succeed in forcing back the food, the person will die. HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY. But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down into the stomach. There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric juice, until it is all a gray fluid. Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which leads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into the blood. The blood carries it to the heart. The heart pumps it out with the blood into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle, and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain. Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner can help to mend any parts that may be broken. Suppose a boy should break one of the bones of his arm, how could it be mended? If you should bind together the two parts of a broken stick and leave them a while, do you think they would grow together? No, indeed! But the doctor could carefully bind together the ends of the broken bone in the boy's arm and leave it for awhile, and the blood would bring it bone food every day, until it had grown together again. So a dinner can both make and mend the different parts of the body. REVIEW",

We, too, need some salt mixed with our food. If we did not put it in, either when cooking, or afterward, we should still get a little in the food itself. FLESH-MAKING FOODS. Muscles are lean meat, that is flesh; so muscles need flesh-making foods. These are milk, and grains like wheat, corn and oats; also, meat and eggs. Most of these foods really come to us out of the ground. Meat and eggs are made from the grain, grass, and other vegetables that the cattle and hens eat. FAT-MAKING FOODS. We need cushions and wrappings of fat, here and there in our bodies, to keep us warm and make us comfortable. So we must have certain kinds of food that will make fat. [Illustration: _Esquimaux catching walrus._] There are right places and wrong places for fat, as well as for other things in this world. When alcohol puts fat into the muscles, that is fat badly made, and in the wrong place. The good fat made for the parts of the body which need it, comes from fat-making foods. In cold weather, we need more fatty food than we do in summer, just as in cold countries people need such food all the time. The Esquimaux, who live in the lands of snow and ice, catch a great many walrus and seal, and eat a great deal of fat meat. You would not be well unless you ate some fat or butter or oil. WHAT WILL MAKE FAT? Sugar will make fat, and so will starch, cream, rice, butter, and fat meat. As milk will make muscle and fat and bones, it is the best kind of food. Here, again, it is the earth that sends us our food. Fat meat comes from animals well fed on grain and grass; sugar, from sugar-cane, maple-trees, or beets; oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and starch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and other grains. Green apples and other unripe fruits are not yet ready to be eaten. The starch which we take for food has to be changed into sugar, before it can mix with the blood and help feed the body. As the sun ripens fruit, it changes its starch to sugar. You can tell this by the difference in the taste of ripe and unripe apples. CANDY. Most children like candy so well, that they are in danger of eating more sugar than is good for them. You would starve if fed only on sugar. We would not need to be quite so much afraid of a little candy if it were not for the poison with which it is often .",

[Illustration: H]ERE, at last, is the bill of fare for our dinner:           Roast beef,           Potatoes,           Tomatoes,           Squash,           Bread,           Butter,           Salt,           Water,           Peaches,           Bananas,           Oranges,           Grapes. What must be done first, with the different kinds of food that are to make up this dinner? The meat, vegetables, and bread must be cooked. Cooking prepares them to be easily worked upon by the mouth and stomach. If they were not cooked, this work would be very hard. Instead of going on quietly and without letting us know any thing about it, there would be pains and aches in the overworked stomach. The fruit is not cooked by a fire; but we might almost say the sun had cooked it, for the sun has ripened and sweetened it. When you are older, some of you may have charge of the cooking in your homes. You must then remember that food well cooked is worth twice as much as food poorly cooked. \"A good cook has more to do with the health of the family, than a good doctor.\" THE SALIVA. Next to the cooking comes the eating. As soon as we begin to chew our food, a juice in the mouth, called saliva (sa l[=i]'va), moistens and mixes with it. Saliva has the wonderful power of turning starch into sugar; and the starch in our food needs to be turned into sugar, before it can be taken into the blood. You can prove for yourselves that saliva can turn starch into sugar. Chew slowly a piece of dry cracker. The cracker is made mostly of starch, because wheat is full of starch. At first, the cracker is dry and tasteless. Soon, however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is changing the starch into sugar. All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva may be able to mix with it. Otherwise, the starch may not be changed; and if one part of your body neglects its",

      "text": "food, instead of waiting for the ripening of fruits in countries which had more or less prolonged periods of cold and inclement weather. Some anatomical changes have doubtless resulted from the practice, but they are not of sufficiently marked character to found much argument upon; all that we can say being that the digestive apparatus in man seems well adapted for digesting any food that is capable of yielding nutriment, and that even when an entire change is made in the mode of feeding, the adaptability of the human system shows itself in a more or less rapid accommodation to the altered circumstances. Food, then, is any substance which can be taken into the body and applied to use, either in building up or repairing the tissues and framework of the body itself, or in providing energy and producing animal heat, or any substance which, without performing those functions directly, controls, directs, or assists their performance. With this wide definition it is evident that we include all the ordinary articles recognized commonly as food, and that we reject all substances recognized commonly as poisons. But it will also include such substances as water and air, both of which are essential for nutrition, but are not usually recognized as belonging to the list of food substances in the ordinary sense. When we carry our investigation further, we find that the organic substances may be again divided into two distinct classes, namely, that which contains nitrogen (the casein), and those that do not (the butter and sugar). On ascertaining this, we are immediately struck with the remarkable fact that all the tissues and fluids of the body, muscles (or flesh), bone, blood--all, in short, except the fat--contain nitrogen, and, consequently, for their building up in the young, and for their repair and renewal in the adult, nitrogen is absolutely required. We therefore reasonably infer that the nitrogenous substance is necessary for this purpose. Experiment has borne this out, for men who have been compelled to live without nitrogenous food by dire necessity, and criminals on whom the experiment has been tried, have all perished sooner or later in consequence. When nitrogenous substances are used in the body, they are, of course, broken up and oxidized, or perhaps we ought to say more accurately, they take the place of the tissues of the body which wear away and are carried off by oxidation and other chemical changes. Now, modern science tell us that such changes are accompanied with manifestations of energy in some form or other, most frequently in that of heat, and we must look, therefore, upon nitrogenous food as contributing to the energy of the body in addition to its other functions. What are the substances which we may class as nitrogenous. In the first place, we have the typical example of the purest form in _albumin_, or white of egg; and from this the name is now given to the class of _albuminates_. The animal albuminates are: Albumin from eggs, fibrin",
