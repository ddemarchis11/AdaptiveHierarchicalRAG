Application for the right of performing this piece must be made to the publishers. BOSTON _WALTER H. BAKER_ Copyright, 1893, by ARTHUR W. PINERO _All rights reserved._ INTRODUCTORY NOTE. \"Dandy Dick\" was the third of the farces which Mr. Pinero wrote for the old Court Theatre--a series of plays which, besides giving playgoers a fresh source of laughter, and the English stage a new order of comic play, brought plentiful prosperity to the joint management of Mr. Arthur Cecil and the late Mr. John Clayton. But a kind of melancholy interest attaches to \"Dandy Dick,\" for this play was, as it were, the swan-song of the old theatre and of the Clayton and Cecil partnership; and it was the piece in which Mr. Clayton was acting when death overtook him, to the general grief. The production of \"Dandy Dick\" may be considered as something of a _tour de force_ in its way. \"The Schoolmistress\" was at the end of its successful run, and Mr. Pinero was under contract to supply its successor by a certain date, when Mr. Clayton one day went down to Brighton, where the dramatist was then at work, to hear him read the two completed acts of the new play. To Mr. Clayton's consternation, however, Mr. Pinero announced that he was dissatisfied with his work, and proposed to begin an entirely new play, as he had a more promising idea. But time was pressing, and a successor to \"The Schoolmistress\" was an immediate necessity. However, Mr. Pinero's idea of writing a play round a dean, who, while being a paragon of dignity and decorum, should be driven by an indiscreet act into a most undignified dilemma, appealed to Mr. Clayton, and hastening back to London with the sketches for the requisite scenes, he left Mr. Pinero to set to work at once upon the new scheme. And within a few weeks, indeed by the time the scenery was ready, the new play was completed, the rural constable of a village adjacent to Brighton having suggested the character of Noah Topping. \"Dandy Dick\" was produced at the Court Theatre on January 27th, 1887, and, meeting with a most favorable initial reception, it settled down immediately into a complete success.

A company had already been sent out, under the auspices of the Court management, to perform \"Dandy Dick\" in the provinces; but, when the play was withdrawn from the London boards, Mr. Clayton set out himself with a company, and it was during this tour that he died at Liverpool. In America Mr. Daly produced \"Dandy Dick\" with Miss Ada Rehan in Mrs. John Wood's part, but no very great success was achieved; whereas in Australia its reception was so enthusiastic that it ran for quite an unusual time both in Melbourne and Sydney. In the character of the Dean, Mr. G. W. Anson achieved perhaps the greatest of his Australian successes, and Mr. Robert Brough made his mark as the policeman. MALCOLM C. SALAMAK. _December_, 1892. DANDY DICK. THE FIRST ACT. _The morning-room in the Deanery of St. Marvells, with a large arched opening leading to the library on the right, and a deeply-recessed window opening out to the garden on the left. It is a bright spring morning, and an air of comfort and serenity pervades the place._ _SALOME, a tall, handsome, dark girl, of about three-and-twenty, is sitting with her elbows resting on her knees, staring wildly into vacancy. SHEBA, a fair little girl of about seventeen, wearing short petticoats, shares her despondency, and lies prostrate upon the settee._ SALOME. Oh! oh my! oh my! oh my! SHEBA. [_Sitting upright._] Oh, my gracious goodness, goodness gracious me! [_They both walk about excitedly._ SALOME. There's only one terrible word for it--it's a fix! SHEBA. It's worse than that! It's a scrape! How did you ever get led into it? SALOME. How did _we_ get led into it? Halves, Sheba, please. SHEBA. It was Major Tarver's proposal, and I believe, Salome, that it is to _you_ Major Tarver is paying attention. SALOME. The Fancy Dress Masked Ball at Durnstone is promoted by the Officers of the Hussars. I believe that the young gentleman you have impressed calls himself an officer, though he is merely a lieutenant. SHEBA. [_Indignantly._] Mr. Darbey is _certainly_ an officer--a small officer. How dare you gird at me, Salome? SALOME. Very well, then. When to-night we appear at the Durnstone Athenaeum, unknown to dear Papa, on the arms of Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey, I consider that we shall be equally wicked. Oh, how can we be so wrong? SHEBA. Well, we're not wrong",

Because I'm down here racing. You see, he's a Dean. GEORGIANA. Is he? Well, then, you just lay a thousand sovereigns to a gooseberry that in this house I'm a Dean, too! SIR TRISTRAM. I suppose he's thinking of the Canons--and the Bishop--and those chaps. GEORGIANA. Lord bless your heart, they're all right when you cheer them up a bit! If I'm here till the autumn meeting you'll find me lunching on the hill, with the Canons marking my card and the dear old Bishop mixing the salad. So say the word, Tris--I'll make it all right with Augustin. SIR TRISTRAM. No, thanks, old fellow. The fact is I'm fixed at the \"Swan\" with--what do you think, George?--with Dandy Dick. GEORGIANA. Oh! my old Dandy! SIR TRISTRAM. I brought him down with me in lavender. You know he runs for the Durnstone Handicap to-morrow. GEORGIANA. Know! There's precious little that horse does that I don't know, and what I don't know I dream. Is he fit? SIR TRISTRAM. As a fiddle--shines like a mirror--not an ounce too much or too little. He'll romp in! GEORGIANA. He'll dance in! Tris Mardon! SIR TRISTRAM. Eh? GEORGIANA. [_Mysteriously._] Tris, Dandy Dick doesn't belong to you--not _all_ of him. SIR TRISTRAM. No--I've only a half share. At your sale he was knocked down to John Fielder the trainer. The other half belongs to John. GEORGIANA. No, it doesn't, it belongs to _me!_ SIR TRISTRAM. George! GEORGIANA. Yes, directly I saw Dandy Dick marched out before the auctioneer I asked John Fielder to help me, and he did, like a Briton.

He is much troubled at it, and will speak to the King and Council of it this morning. So I went to my Lady's and dined with her, and found my Lord Hinchingbroke somewhat better. After dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Theatre, and there saw \"The Alchymist;\" and there I saw Sir W. Pen, who took us when the play was done and carried the Captain to Paul's and set him down, and me home with him, and he and I to the Dolphin, but not finding Sir W. Batten there, we went and carried a bottle of wine to his house, and there sat a while and talked, and so home to bed. At home I found a letter from Mr. Creed of the 15th of July last, that tells me that my Lord is rid of his pain (which was wind got into the muscles of his right side) and his feaver, and is now in hopes to go aboard in a day or two, which do give me mighty great comfort. 15th. To the Privy Seal and Whitehall, up and down, and at noon Sir W. Pen carried me to Paul's, and so I walked to the Wardrobe and dined with my Lady, and there told her, of my Lord's sickness (of which though it hath been the town-talk this fortnight, she had heard nothing) and recovery, of which she was glad, though hardly persuaded of the latter. I found my Lord Hinchingbroke better and better, and the worst past. Thence to the Opera, which begins again to-day with \"The Witts,\" never acted yet with scenes; and the King and Duke and Duchess were there (who dined to-day with Sir H. Finch, reader at the Temple, in great state); and indeed it is a most excellent play, and admirable scenes. So home and was overtaken by Sir W. Pen in his coach, who has been this afternoon with my Lady Batten, &c., at the Theatre. So I followed him to the Dolphin, where Sir W. Batten was, and there we sat awhile, and so home after we had made shift to fuddle Mr. Falconer of Woolwich. So home. 16th.
