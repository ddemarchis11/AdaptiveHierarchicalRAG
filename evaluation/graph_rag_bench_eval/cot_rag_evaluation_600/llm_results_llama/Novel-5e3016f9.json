  "gold_answer": "The heart pumps blood, and blood carries food.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n1. In the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, what is the relationship between the heart and blood in distributing nutrients, specifically how does the heart pump blood and how does the blood carry food throughout the body?\n\nThe heart pumps blood through tubes, shaped like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the body. The blood carries food to every part of the body, leaving with each part just what it needs. The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of the body, and to take away worn-out matter.\n\n2. How does the heart pump blood?\n\nThe heart pumps blood by the working of its strong muscles, similar to a fire-engine forcing water through a hose.\n\n3. How does the blood carry food throughout the body?\n\nThe blood carries food to every part of the body, leaving with each part just what it needs. The blood is pumped out of the heart and carried through the body by the arteries, which branch out into smaller and smaller tubes, eventually reaching every part of the body.\n\n4. What is the role of the lungs in the process of distributing nutrients?\n\nThe lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and pure again. They take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide, which helps to purify the blood.\n\n5. What is the relationship between the heart and the lungs?\n\nThe heart pumps blood to the lungs, where it is purified and made bright and red again. The purified blood is then pumped back out to the body.\n\n6. How does the blood become impure?\n\nThe blood becomes impure because it carries away waste matter from the body. By the time it is ready to be sent back by the veins, the blood is no longer pure and red, but dull and bluish in color, because it is full of impurities.\n\n7. How is the blood made pure and red again?\n\nThe blood is made pure and red again by the lungs, which use fresh air to purify it.\n\n8. What is the role of the skin in the process of distributing nutrients?\n\nThe skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration tubes. It helps to remove impurities from the body and keep it healthy.\n\n9. How does the body distribute nutrients throughout the body?\n\nThe body distributes nutrients throughout the body by the blood, which carries food to every part of the body, leaving with each part just what it needs. The blood is pumped out of the heart and carried through the body by the arteries, which branch out into smaller and smaller tubes, eventually reaching every part of the body.\n\n10. What is the relationship between the brain and the blood?\n\nThe brain needs very pure, good blood sent to it, to keep it strong. Good blood is made from good food, and the brain needs a great deal of blood to function properly.",

[Illustration: T]HE blood flows all through the body, carrying good food to every part. It also gathers up from every part the worn-out matter that can no longer be used. By the time it is ready to be sent back by the veins, the blood is no longer pure and red. It is dull and bluish in color, because it is full of impurities. If you look at the veins in your wrist, you will see that they look blue. If all this bad blood goes back to the heart, will the heart have to pump out bad blood next time? No, for the heart has neighbors very near at hand, ready to change the bad blood to pure, red blood again. THE LUNGS. These neighbors are the lungs. They are in the chest on each side of the heart. When you breathe, their little air-cells swell out, or expand, to take in the air. Then they contract again, and the air passes out through your mouth or nose. The lungs must have plenty of fresh air, and plenty of room to work in. [Illustration: _The lungs, heart, and air-passages._] If your clothes are too tight and the lungs do not have room to expand, they can not take in so much air as they should. Then the blood can not be made pure, and the whole body will suffer. For every good breath of fresh air, the lungs take in, they send out one of impure air. In this way, by taking out what is bad, they prepare the blood to go back to the heart pure and red, and to be pumped out through the body again. How the lungs can use the fresh air for doing this good work, you can not yet understand. By and by, when you are older, you will learn more about it. CARE OF THE LUNGS. Do the lungs ever rest? You never stop breathing, not even in",

      "text": "larger. HOW THE HEART WORKS. Probably some of you have seen a fire-engine throwing a stream of water through a hose upon a burning building. As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the body. These tubes are called arteries (aer't[)e]r iz). Those tubes which bring the blood back again to the heart, are called veins (v[=a]nz). You can see some of the smaller veins in your wrist. If you press your finger upon an artery in your wrist, you can feel the steady beating of the pulse. This tells just how fast the heart is pumping and the blood flowing. The doctor feels your pulse when you are sick, to find out whether the heart is working too fast, or too slowly, or just right. Some way is needed to send the gray fluid that is made from the food we eat and drink, to every part of the body. To send the food with the blood is a sure way of making it reach every part. So, when the stomach has prepared the food, the blood takes it up and carries it to every part of the body. It then leaves with each part, just what it needs. THE BLOOD AND THE BRAIN. As the brain has so much work to attend to, it must have very pure, good blood sent to it, to keep it strong. Good blood is made from good food. It can not be good if it has been poisoned with alcohol or tobacco. We must also remember that the brain needs a great deal of blood. If we take alcohol into our blood, much of it goes to the brain. There it affects the nerves, and makes a man lose control over his actions. EXERCISE. When you run, you can feel your heart beating. It gets an instant of rest between the beats. Good exercise in the fresh air makes the heart work well and warms the body better than a fire could do. DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE HEART? Your heart is made of muscle. You know what harm alcohol does to the muscles. Could a fatty heart work as well as a muscular heart? No more than a fatty arm could do the work of a muscular arm. Besides, alcohol makes the heart beat too fast, and so it gets too tired. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. Where is the heart placed?           2. Of what is it made?           3.

The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku lar) walls. Every time we breathe, these walls have to move. The muscles of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you breathe. All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is directed by the nerves. You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so you are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs. Is alcohol a help to them? REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1.

[Illustration: T]HERE is another part of your body carrying away waste matter all the time--it is the skin. The body is covered with skin. It is also lined with a more delicate kind of skin. You can see where the outside skin and the lining skin meet at your lips. There is a thin outside layer of skin which we can pull off without hurting ourselves; but I advise you not to do so. Because under the outside skin is the true skin, which is so full of little nerves that it will feel the least touch as pain. When the outer skin, which protects it, is torn away, we must cover the true",

No part can fail to do its work without causing trouble to the rest of the body. But you should always wear rubbers out-of-doors when the ground is wet. Certainly, they are very useful then. When you are out in the fresh air, you are giving the other parts of your body such a good chance to perspire, that your feet can bear a little shutting up. But as soon as you come into the house, take the rubbers off. Now that you know what the skin is doing all the time, you will understand that the clothes worn next to your skin are full of little worn-out particles, brought out by the perspiration. When these clothes are taken off at night, they should be so spread out, that they will air well before morning. Never wear any of the clothes through the night, that you have worn during the day. Do not roll up your night-dress in the morning and put it under your pillow. Give it first a good airing at the window and then hang it where the air can reach it all day. By so doing, you will have sweeter sleep at night. You are old enough to throw the bed-clothes off from the bed, before leaving your rooms in the morning. In this way, the bed and bed-clothes may have a good airing. Be sure to give them time enough for this. WORK OF THE BODY. You have now learned about four important kinds of work:-- 1st. The stomach prepares the food for the blood to take. 2d. The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of the body, and to take away worn-out matter. 3d. The lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and pure again. 4th. The skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration tubes. All this work goes on, day and night, without our needing to think about it at all; for messages are sent to the muscles by the nerves which keep them faithfully at work, whether we know it or not.

      "text": "however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is changing the starch into sugar. All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva may be able to mix with it. Otherwise, the starch may not be changed; and if one part of your body neglects its work, another part will have more than its share to do. That is hardly fair. If you swallow your food in a hurry and do not let the saliva do its work, the stomach will have extra work. But it will find it hard to do more than its own part, and, perhaps, will complain. It can not speak in words; but will by aching, and that is almost as plain as words. SWALLOWING. Next to the chewing, comes the swallowing. Is there any thing wonderful about that? We have two passages leading down our throats. One is to the lungs, for breathing; the other, to the stomach, for swallowing. Do you wonder why the food does not sometimes go down the wrong way? The windpipe leading to the lungs is in front of the other tube. It has at its top a little trap-door. This opens when we breathe and shuts when we swallow, so that the food slips over it safely into the passage behind, which leads to the stomach. If you try to speak while you have food in your mouth, this little door has to open, and some bit of food may slip in. The windpipe will not pass it to the lungs, but tries to force it back. Then we say the food chokes us. If the windpipe can not succeed in forcing back the food, the person will die. HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY. But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down into the stomach. There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric juice, until it is all a gray fluid. Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which leads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into the blood. The blood carries it to the heart. The heart pumps it out with the blood into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle, and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain. Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner can help to mend any parts that may be broken. Suppose a boy should break one of the bones of his arm, how could it be mended? If you should bind together the two parts of a broken stick and leave them a while, do you think they would grow together? No, indeed! But the doctor could carefully bind together the ends of the broken bone in the boy's arm and leave it for awhile, and the blood would bring it bone food every day, until it had grown together again. So a dinner can both make and mend the different parts of the body. REVIEW",

Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can not carry their messages correctly. Then the brain can not think well. Alcohol does not strengthen the mind. Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make him useful and happy. Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole. Would you be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a palace, and had a million of dollars?
