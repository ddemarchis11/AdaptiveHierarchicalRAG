  "llm_answer": "The East River plays a significant role in Rags Raegen's actions and reputation, particularly in instances where he interacts with the river during police chases. \n\nRags is described as being at home in the water, particularly in the East River. He has been known to dive into the river to escape from the police, and has even swum back underwater to the landing steps, leaving the police and a crowd of stevedores watching for him to reappear where he had sunk. This aquatic prowess is a key aspect of his reputation and is often used to his advantage in evading capture.\n\nIn one instance, Rags is able to use his knowledge of the river to his advantage when he is being pursued by the police. He dives into the river and then pretends to be a drowned man, causing the police to drag the river bed around Wakeman's Slip with grappling irons for four hours while Rags sits on the wharf and directs their movements.\n\nThe East River also serves as a means of escape for Rags, as he knows of old men who will row him across the river to Astoria or pilot him across to the Jersey shore, allowing him to evade capture and start anew.\n\nOverall, the East River is a key element in Rags' actions and reputation, and is often used as a means of escape and evasion in his interactions with the police.",
