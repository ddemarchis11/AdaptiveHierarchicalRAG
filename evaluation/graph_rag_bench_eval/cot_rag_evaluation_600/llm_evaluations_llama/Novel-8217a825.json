    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information that Falmouth is located near Flushing, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not contain relevant information about Falmouth or its location, so the model's claim of not finding information is technically accurate but does not address the question correctly. The answer lacks correctness, grounding, and evidence coverage."
