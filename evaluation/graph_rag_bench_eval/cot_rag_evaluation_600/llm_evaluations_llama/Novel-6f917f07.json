    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the romantic relationship between Latimer and Ellen and Latimer's love for her, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces additional details about the bishop's disapproval and Latimer's suitability as a suitor, which are not explicitly supported by the retrieved context. While the retrieved context does mention Latimer's love for Ellen and her identity as the bishop's daughter, it does not provide clear evidence of the bishop's disapproval or concerns about Latimer's past actions. Thus, the faithfulness and evidence coverage scores are reduced due to unsupported extrapolations."
