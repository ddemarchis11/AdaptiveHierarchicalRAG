    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Sheba defending Mr. Darbey's status as an officer, which is supported by the context. However, it does not fully address the relationship between Mr. Darbey's status and his interactions with The Dean and Sheba, as outlined in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it misses key elements such as The Dean seeing Mr. Darbey and Sheba speaking to him, which are explicitly mentioned in the Gold Answer."
