    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the violin as the stringed instrument played with a fiddle-bow, which aligns with the Gold Answer's reference to the fiddle. However, the Retrieved Context does not explicitly support this claim, as it does not mention the violin or fiddle-bow directly. The Model Answer partially covers the evidence by identifying the violin, but it misses the explicit mention of 'fiddle' from the Gold Answer."
