The author notes that the Mayas and the inhabitants of Hindostan share similarities in their customs, manners, scientific attainments, and writing systems. (Novel-30752_c_40)\n2. The author suggests that these similarities indicate a common origin or intimate communication between the ancestors of the Mayas and the inhabitants of Hindostan. (Novel-30752_c_40)\n3. The author points out that the name \"Maya\" is found in various cultures, including Hindostan, Greece, and the lands beyond the Atlantic Ocean, and that it is associated with the concept of a magician, astronomer, or learned man. (Novel-30752_c_67)\n4. The author notes that the Mayas deified and paid divine honors to their eminent men and women after their death, and that this practice was likely carried to other countries where they emigrated. (Novel-30752_c_67)\n5. The author suggests that the Mayas may have originated from a place called Mayab, which was a locality with a porous soil that absorbed water quickly, and that they took their name from this place. (Novel-30752_c_18)\n6. The author notes that the Mayas and the Egyptians share similarities in their religious beliefs, customs, and scientific attainments, and that these similarities cannot be accidental. (Novel-30752_c_40)\n7. The author suggests that the Mayas may have had communication with the Egyptians in remote ages, or that they may have had a common descent. (Novel-30752_c_40)\n8. The author notes that the Mayas were a powerful and advanced civilization that built impressive monuments, such as the ones found in Ake, which date back to at least 5,760 years ago. (Novel-30752_c_68)\n9. The author suggests that the Mayas may have had conflicts with the Spanish, who were trying to penetrate into their territories, and that this conflict may have been similar to the one described in the Ramayana, where the emissaries of Rama were put to death for violating the prohibition of entering the Mayas' territories. (Novel-30752_c_19)\n\nThe connection between Mayab's similarity with Hindostan and the Mayas' conflict with the Spanish is not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred that the author is suggesting that the Mayas' advanced civilization and their connections with other cultures, including Hindostan, may have contributed to their conflict with the Spanish.",
