  "question": "How did the French Canadians' loyalty to the British crown manifest in times of war?",
  "gold_answer": "French Canadians were loyal to the British crown, which had loyalty from French-Canadian militiamen who fought with English-speaking fellow-countrymen.",
  "llm_answer": "The French Canadians' loyalty to the British crown manifested in times of war as follows:\n\n1. During the Napoleonic wars, the sympathies of Canada were almost wholly with Great Britain. When news arrived of the defeat of the French fleet at Trafalgar, a Te Deum was sung in the Catholic cathedral at Quebec, and a future bishop of the French-Canadian Church enunciated the principle that 'all events which tend to broaden the gap separating us from France should be welcome.'\n\n2. In the War of 1812-14, French-Canadian militiamen under French-Canadian officers fought shoulder to shoulder with their English-speaking fellow-countrymen on several stricken fields of battle. The heroic prowess of Major de Salaberry and his French-Canadian soldiers won the day for British arms at the Battle of Chateauguay.\n\n3. During the Rebellion of 1837, French-Canadian veterans of the War of 1812 fought against the British, but it is not clear if they were fighting for the British crown or against it.",
