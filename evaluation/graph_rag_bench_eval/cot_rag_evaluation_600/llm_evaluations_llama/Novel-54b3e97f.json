    "explanation": "The Model Answer lists multiple individuals who drank with Mr. Pepys, but none of them match the Gold Answer ('Mr. Starling'). Furthermore, the retrieved context does not support the inclusion of these names as individuals who drank with Mr. Pepys. The Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
