  "question": "In the years following the British conquest of Canada, how did the British government treat the French language in official matters, particularly regarding its use in law-courts and its status relative to English?",
  "gold_answer": "The French language was placed on a level with the English language, and the British government made no objection to the use of French in law-courts.",
  "llm_answer": "The British government treated the French language in official matters with a high degree of respect and recognition, particularly regarding its use in law-courts and its status relative to English.\n\nThe Quebec Act of 1774 granted the French inhabitants of Canada the whole of the French civil law, to the almost complete exclusion of the English common law. This suggests that the British government recognized the importance of the French language in official matters and was willing to accommodate the French-speaking population.\n\nIn 1792, the question arose as to the use of the French language in the Assembly as a medium of debate. The French-Canadian members, representing the majority of the population, pressed for the official recognition of their language on a parity with English. Although the English members opposed this, the British government did not object to the use of French in the law-courts, and it was inferred that the use of the French language had been authorized.\n\nThe British government's conciliatory policy towards the French-speaking population is evident in the fact that they granted them equal political rights with the English-speaking population in 1791, despite the fact that Roman Catholics were debarred from sitting in the House of Commons at Westminster.\n\nOverall, the British government's treatment of the French language in official matters was one of recognition and accommodation, reflecting their desire to maintain good relations with the French-speaking population and to avoid any potential conflict.",
