    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that there is insufficient evidence to determine an alternate name for Figheegh. The Gold Answer clearly identifies 'Figuiq' as another name for Figheegh, and this is supported by the Retrieved Context, which mentions 'Figheegh, or Figuiq.' The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information and does not utilize the context effectively."
