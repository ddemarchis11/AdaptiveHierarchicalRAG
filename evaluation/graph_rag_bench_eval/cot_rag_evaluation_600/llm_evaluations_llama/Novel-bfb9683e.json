    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies 'Hygiene for Young People' as the book containing a section on TOBACCO, whereas the Gold Answer specifies 'Child's Health Primer.' The Retrieved Context supports the Gold Answer, showing that TOBACCO is part of the contents of 'Child's Health Primer,' not 'Hygiene for Young People.' The Model Answer is neither correct nor faithful to the context, and it fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
