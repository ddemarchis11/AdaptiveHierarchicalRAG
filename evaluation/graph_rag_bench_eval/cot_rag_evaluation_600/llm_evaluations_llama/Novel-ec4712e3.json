  "question": "In what way did the storm affect the journey of the coach along the mountain road, considering the storm's fury spent on the mountain and the incident where the coach ran upon the pole-straps of the arrested horses?",
  "gold_answer": "The storm spent its fury on the mountain, and the coach ran upon the pole-straps.",
  "llm_answer": "The storm affected the journey of the coach along the mountain road in the following ways:\n\n1. The storm caused a slight jarring of the coach, a grinding and hissing from the brakes, and a sudden jolt as the vehicle ran upon and recoiled from the taut pole-straps of the now arrested horses.\n2. The storm made it difficult for the passengers to see, with the sound of falling rain on the roof, a soft swaying of wind-tossed trees, and an impatient movement on the box-seat being all they heard.\n3. The storm caused the road to be slippery and difficult to navigate, with the coach's sledge-runners hanging beneath the wagon, ready to be shipped under the useless wheels, an ominous provision.\n4. The storm made the air cold and the wind chill, with the passengers feeling the effects of the cold.\n5. The storm caused the road to be covered in snow, with the ground becoming white with it, the road gleaming out ahead in the darkness, and the roof and sides of the wagon being overlaid with it.\n6. The storm caused the coach to be slowed down, with the horses being urged forward, and the vehicle beginning to add the momentum of its descent to its conflict with the storm.\n7. The storm caused the darkness to seem to have risen from below, and to flow in upon them as they descended, with a curtain of profound obscurity shutting out the horizon and the valley below.\n\nHowever, as the coach descended further, the storm seemed to be spending its fury high up and behind them, and the road became more strongly defined as it plunged downward to a terrace on the mountain flank, several hundred feet below.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed account of the storm's effects on the coach journey, but it includes several unsupported claims and extrapolations not found in the retrieved context, such as the cold wind chill and snow covering the road. While it mentions the coach running upon the pole-straps, which aligns with the Gold Answer, it introduces additional details that are not grounded in the provided context. The core meaning of the Gold Answer is partially captured, but the excessive and unsupported elaboration reduces faithfulness and evidence coverage."
