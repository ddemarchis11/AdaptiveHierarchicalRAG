  "question": "Write a diary entry as the Parrot, describing your life with your mistress, the farewell, and being snatched away, while referencing the trouble caused to her lover.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — My days with my mistress were filled with warmth and chatter. Today, I said farewell to Corinna, her eyes glistening with sorrow. I was snatched away by envy, separated from her gentle hands. I have heard it said that my mistress is born to be a cause of trouble to her lover, and perhaps, even my loss plays a part in the tangled affairs of the heart.",
  "llm_answer": "Dear Diary,\n\nI am but a parrot, a creature of words and song. My life was one of joy and companionship with my mistress, Corinna. I would sit by her side, mimic her words, and bring laughter to her face. But alas, my time with her was short-lived.\n\nI remember the day I was snatched away from her, taken by some cruel hand. I was the cause of no wars, no strife, only the chatter of a peaceful bird. I was content with a simple life, a nut for food, a drop of water to quench my thirst. But my love of talking was my downfall.\n\nMy mistress wept for me, her prayers borne on the wind to the farthest reaches of the land. But it was not to be. My fate was sealed, and I was taken from her side.\n\nAs I lay on my deathbed, I cried out to Corinna, \"Farewell!\" And in that moment, I knew that I would be remembered, that my words would live on.\n\nNow, I find myself in a new home, a grove of dark holm oaks, where the innocent birds roam free. I am among the swans, the Phoenix, and the gentle dove. And though I am but a parrot, I am at peace.\n\nBut I know that my mistress still thinks of me, that she remembers the words I spoke, the laughter I brought. And though I am gone, my spirit lives on, a reminder of the love we shared.\n\nFarewell, dear diary. May my words be a testament to the love I knew with Corinna.\n\nYours truly,\nThe Parrot",
