    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that there is insufficient evidence to determine the connection between the Shereefs and military forces in Draha. The Retrieved Context explicitly mentions that the Shereefs maintained a force of ten thousand cavalry in Draha, which aligns with the Gold Answer. The Model Answer fails to address this key fact and does not utilize the provided context effectively."
