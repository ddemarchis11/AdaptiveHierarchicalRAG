    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between Mayab and Hindostan, but it introduces additional claims and connections (e.g., mythology, Greece, Afghanistan) that are not explicitly supported by the retrieved context. While it captures the idea of similarity and the presence of Maya in Hindostan, it diverges from the core focus of the Gold Answer and includes speculative or unsupported details. The retrieved context does not fully substantiate all the claims made in the Model Answer, leading to partial correctness and faithfulness."
