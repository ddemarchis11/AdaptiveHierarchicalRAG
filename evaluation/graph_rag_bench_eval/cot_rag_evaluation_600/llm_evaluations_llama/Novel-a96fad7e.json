  "llm_answer": "After the King's appointment of my Lord as Embassador, my Lord's subsequent actions—such as thanking Sir R.

Slingsby, illustrate the distribution of royal favor. On the 13th of the month, it is stated that \"I heard my Lord thank him for his kindness to me, which Sir Robert answered much to my advantage.\" This shows that my Lord is grateful for the support and kindness shown to him by Sir R. Slingsby, and that he is acknowledging the favor that has been bestowed upon him.\n\nMy Lord's issuance of orders to Mr. Creed also illustrates the delegation of responsibilities within the court.
