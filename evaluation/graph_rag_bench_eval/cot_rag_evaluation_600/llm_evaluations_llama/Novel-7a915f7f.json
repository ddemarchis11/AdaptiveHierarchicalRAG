    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Dr. Elsie Inglis's contributions to medical education and women's rights, including co-founding the Medical College for Women and her involvement in the Women's Liberal League. However, it introduces additional details, such as the Muir Hall of Residence and the Hospice, which are not explicitly supported by the retrieved context. While these claims may be accurate, they are not grounded in the provided evidence, reducing faithfulness. The evidence coverage is partial because the Model Answer includes the core facts from the Gold Answer but adds unsupported claims and misses the concise focus on her pivotal roles in Edinburgh."
