  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, here are the answers to the questions:\n\n1. In the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, what is the relationship between the heart and blood in distributing nutrients, specifically how does the heart pump blood and how does the blood carry food throughout the body?\n\nThe heart pumps blood through tubes, shaped like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the body. The blood carries food to every part of the body, leaving with each part just what it needs. The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of the body, and to take away worn-out matter.\n\n2. How does the heart pump blood?\n\nThe heart pumps blood by the working of its strong muscles, similar to a fire-engine forcing water through a hose.\n\n3. How does the blood carry food throughout the body?\n\nThe blood carries food to every part of the body, leaving with each part just what it needs. The blood is pumped out of the heart and carried through the body by the arteries, which branch out into smaller and smaller tubes, eventually reaching every part of the body.\n\n4. What is the role of the lungs in the process of distributing nutrients?\n\nThe lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and pure again. They take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide, which helps to purify the blood.\n\n5. What is the relationship between the heart and the lungs?\n\nThe heart pumps blood to the lungs, where it is purified and made bright and red again. The purified blood is then pumped back out to the body.\n\n6. How does the blood become impure?\n\nThe blood becomes impure because it carries away waste matter from the body. By the time it is ready to be sent back by the veins, the blood is no longer pure and red, but dull and bluish in color, because it is full of impurities.\n\n7. How is the blood made pure and red again?\n\nThe blood is made pure and red again by the lungs, which use fresh air to purify it.\n\n8. What is the role of the skin in the process of distributing nutrients?\n\nThe skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration tubes. It helps to remove impurities from the body and keep it healthy.\n\n9. How does the body distribute nutrients throughout the body?\n\nThe body distributes nutrients throughout the body by the blood, which carries food to every part of the body, leaving with each part just what it needs. The blood is pumped out of the heart and carried through the body by the arteries, which branch out into smaller and smaller tubes, eventually reaching every part of the body.\n\n10. What is the relationship between the brain and the blood?\n\nThe brain needs very pure, good blood sent to it, to keep it strong. Good blood is made from good food, and the brain needs a great deal of blood to function properly.",
