    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not provide sufficient information, whereas the context clearly describes Miss Euphemia Trotter's early life as a poor girl educated at an Eastern seminary, where she later became a teacher. This matches the Gold Answer, but the Model Answer fails to address the question or utilize the provided context."
