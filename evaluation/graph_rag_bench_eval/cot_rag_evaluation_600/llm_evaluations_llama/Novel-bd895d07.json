  "gold_answer": "The stomach prepares food, and food is carried by blood.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, the body processes food for use in growth and energy as follows:\n\n1. Preparation of food by the stomach: The stomach works the food over and mixes in gastric juice, until it is all a gray fluid. This process changes the food into a form in which it can be easily absorbed by the body.\n\n2. Transportation of food by the blood: The prepared food is taken into the blood, which carries it to the heart. The heart pumps the blood out with the food into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle, and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain.\n\nThe blood carries the food to every part of the body, where it is used to feed and mend the different parts. The food is changed into a form in which it can get to each part and feed it, allowing the body to grow and repair itself.\n\nIt is also mentioned that the saliva in the mouth has the power of turning starch into sugar, which is necessary for the food to be taken into the blood. The saliva mixes with the food and changes the starch into sugar, allowing the body to absorb the nutrients from the food.\n\nAdditionally, the book explains that the heart pumps the blood through tubes, shaped like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the body. The blood carries the food to every part of the body, where it is used to feed and mend the different parts.\n\nOverall, the body processes food for use in growth and energy by preparing it in the stomach and transporting it through the blood to every part of the body, where it is used to feed and mend the different parts.",
