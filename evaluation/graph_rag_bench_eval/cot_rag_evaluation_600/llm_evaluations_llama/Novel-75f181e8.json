    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct beach name, Kennack Sands, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not explicitly mention Kennack Sands or provide relevant information to support the Model Answer's uncertainty. Therefore, the response is incorrect, ungrounded, and lacks coverage of the key fact."
