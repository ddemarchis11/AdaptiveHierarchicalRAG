    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct response to the question, which is that Augustin Cuvillier voted against the Ninety-Two Resolutions. The retrieved context does not explicitly mention this fact, but the Model Answer does not utilize external knowledge to address the question either. Consequently, it is incorrect, ungrounded, and does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
