  "question": "Imagine you are Young Simon. Write a diary entry about your family connections and your feelings about the events involving your cousin Cæsar and Roxie.",
  "gold_answer": "As the only son of S. S. Simon, I often hear stories about our family. My cousin, Cæsar, has been at the center of recent events, from delivering a note to the Governor to helping Simon learn about Roxie's family. I hear Roxie has been charged, and I worry for her. Our family feels so interconnected, especially with big-sis raising Cæsar and our ties to the Carlow and Brindle families.",
  "llm_answer": "March 1861\n\nDear Diary,\n\nToday I had a conversation with Roxie Daymon, a young lady I met on the steamboat. She's an orphan, raised in Kentucky, and has no family history to speak of. I was trying to learn more about her family, but she seemed hesitant to share. I got the impression that there's a mystery surrounding her past.\n\nAfter talking to Roxie, I went to see my cousin Cæsar, who's been keeping secrets from me. He told me that Roxie is an heir to a large estate, and that there are others in Kentucky who are also entitled to a share. I'm not sure what to make of this, but it seems like there's more to Roxie's story than she's letting on.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about my own family history, and I'm starting to realize that I know very little about my ancestors. My father was a cotton planter, and he had a reputation for being a hard master and a keen financier. He was obsessed with dying a rich man, and it seems like that obsession consumed him.\n\nI've been feeling unwell lately, and I'm starting to worry that I may not have much time left. I've been thinking about my own mortality, and I'm not sure what the future holds.\n\nI'm engaged to be married to Roxie, and I'm excited to start a new life with her. But I'm also worried about the secrets she may be keeping from me. I hope that we can build a life together, free from the mysteries and scandals of the past.\n\nYours truly,\nYoung Simon",
