  "question": "How is the harp’s presence in British history connected to David’s musical practices?",
  "gold_answer": "David played the lyre and used to suspend the kinnor, which is rendered as harp and is in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript.",
  "llm_answer": "There is no direct connection between the harp's presence in British history and David's musical practices in the provided evidence. However, it is mentioned that the Greeks called the harp _kinyra_, and this may be the reason why in the English translation of the Bible the _kinnor_ of the Hebrews, the favourite instrument of king David, is rendered _harp_.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the connection between David's musical practices and the harp's presence in British history, as supported by the context. It explains that the Hebrew kinnor, David's favorite instrument, is rendered as 'harp' in English translations, aligning with the Gold Answer. The additional detail about the Greek term 'kinyra' is relevant and grounded in the context."
