    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies that Elsie Maud Inglis wrote to the Registered Medical Women's Association, but the Model Answer incorrectly states that there is insufficient evidence to determine the association. This contradicts the Gold Answer and fails to provide the required factual information. Additionally, the Retrieved Context does not provide direct evidence to support the Model Answer's claim of insufficient evidence, making it unfaithful to the context."
