    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed list of musical instruments attributed to the Aztecs, including whistles, flutes, drums, bells, sonorous metal, yotl-bells, and ajacaxtli. However, the Gold Answer specifically mentions only the huehuetl and teponaztli, which are not explicitly listed in the Model Answer. While the Model Answer includes instruments supported by the context, it does not focus on the key instruments mentioned in the Gold Answer, and some claims (e.g., sonorous metal and yotl-bells) are not clearly grounded in the retrieved context."
