    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed account of the Sultan's roles and powers, but it includes several claims that are not directly supported by the retrieved context, such as the Sultan being the head of the orthodox religion of the Mussulmen of the West and his ability to unite tribes against a common foe. While the Gold Answer focuses on the Sultan's power over Morocco and his residence in a palace, the Model Answer expands significantly but misses the simplicity and directness of the Gold Answer. Some claims in the Model Answer are partially grounded in the context, but others are unsupported or extrapolated, leading to partial correctness and faithfulness."
