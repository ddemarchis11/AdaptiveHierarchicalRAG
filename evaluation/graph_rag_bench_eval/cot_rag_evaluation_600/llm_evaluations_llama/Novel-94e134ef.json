    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Saffee is near Mogador, which is supported by the retrieved context mentioning Saffee being one and a half day's journey from Mogador. The Model Answer incorrectly identifies Toser as the city near Mogador, which is not supported by the context and contradicts the Gold Answer."
