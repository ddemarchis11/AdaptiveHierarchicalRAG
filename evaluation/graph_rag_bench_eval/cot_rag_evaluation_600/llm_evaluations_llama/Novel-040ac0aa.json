  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.5,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed comparison of the Green Man's interactions with Eily and Eileen Macarthy, but it introduces unsupported claims about differences in tone and behavior that are not grounded in the retrieved context. While the core overlap of actions (meeting, granting a wish, asking questions, receiving answers) aligns with the Gold Answer, the additional details about differences in seriousness, humor, and motivations are speculative and not evidenced in the context. This reduces both faithfulness and evidence coverage."
