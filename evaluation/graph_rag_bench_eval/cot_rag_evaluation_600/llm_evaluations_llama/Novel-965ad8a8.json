    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that there is insufficient evidence to determine Corinna's identity, which contradicts the Gold Answer that identifies Julia as the suspected individual. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it fails to include the key fact from the Gold Answer and does not address the question directly."
