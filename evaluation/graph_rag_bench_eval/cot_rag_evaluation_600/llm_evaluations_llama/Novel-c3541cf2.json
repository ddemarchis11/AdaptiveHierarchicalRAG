  "llm_answer": "The narrative reveals the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters, specifically through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" and Augustin's role as the Dean.\n\nGeorgiana Tidman uses the nickname \"George Tidd\" as a reference to her racing name. This is evident when she says, \"Trust George Tidd for setting things quite square in a palace or a puddle\" and later when she produces her pocket-handkerchief with her racing colors, \"crimson and black diamonds.\" This nickname is used to distinguish her from her more refined and proper identity as Georgiana Tidman, the Dean's sister.\n\nAugustin, the Dean, uses the nickname \"Gus\" when referring to himself, which is evident when Georgiana says, \"Gus, I don't like your looks, I shall let the Vet see you in the morning.\" This nickname is used to convey a sense of familiarity and informality, which contrasts with the Dean's more formal and proper identity.\n\nThe use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters serves to reveal their personalities and relationships with one another. Georgiana's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" suggests that she is a free-spirited and unconventional individual who is not afraid to take risks and challenge social norms. Augustin's use of the nickname \"Gus\" suggests that he is a more informal and relaxed individual who is willing to let his guard down around those he trusts.\n\nThe impact of this on the unfolding of their personal and social identities is significant. Georgiana's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" allows her to maintain a sense of independence and autonomy, which is essential to her identity as a racing enthusiast and a free spirit. Augustin's use of the nickname \"Gus\" allows him to connect with Georgiana on a more personal level, which is essential to their relationship as siblings.\n\nOverall, the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters serves to add depth and complexity to the narrative, revealing their personalities, relationships, and identities in a more nuanced and subtle way.",
