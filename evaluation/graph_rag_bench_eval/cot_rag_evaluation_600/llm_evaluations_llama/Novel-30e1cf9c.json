    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about the creator of the illustrations for the German edition of 'Tristram Shandy'. However, the Gold Answer specifies J. F. Schröter as the illustrator, which the Model Answer fails to include. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not answer the question correctly or cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
