  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, here's how Papineau's actions during the period leading up to and following the Ninety-Two Resolutions affected his relationship with John Neilson, including Neilson's opposition to the resolutions, his eventual break with Papineau, and his alignment with Augustin Cuvillier:\n\nPapineau's actions and views became more revolutionary, and he began to dominate the Assembly, which alienated some of his followers, including John Neilson. Neilson opposed the expulsion of Mondelet from the House, the abolition of the Legislative Council, and Papineau's language in the debate on Quesnel's bill for the independence of judges. This led to a coolness between the two men.\n\nNeilson, along with Augustin Cuvillier, Andrew Stuart, and F. A. Quesnel, opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions and voted against them in the Assembly. This marked a significant break between Papineau and Neilson, as well as the other opposition members.\n\nAfter the Ninety-Two Resolutions were passed, Papineau's position in the Assembly remained strong, but the opposition members, including Neilson, suffered defeat in the general election that followed. However, Papineau's actions and views continued to alienate some of his followers, and Neilson eventually broke away from Papineau's party.\n\nNeilson's break with Papineau was likely due to Papineau's increasingly extreme views and behavior, which Neilson and other opposition members found unacceptable. Neilson's alignment with Augustin Cuvillier and other opposition members suggests that he was seeking a more moderate and conciliatory approach to resolving the issues in Lower Canada.\n\nIn summary, Papineau's actions and views during the period leading up to and following the Ninety-Two Resolutions led to a significant break between him and John Neilson, who eventually aligned with Augustin Cuvillier and other opposition members.",
