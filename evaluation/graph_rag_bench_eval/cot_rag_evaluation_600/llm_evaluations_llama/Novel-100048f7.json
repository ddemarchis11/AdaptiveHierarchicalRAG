    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides some relevant details about Augustin's involvement with horse racing and betting, but it introduces unsupported claims about his downfall and family scandal, which are not grounded in the retrieved context. The Gold Answer specifies that Augustin is also known as The Dean, is the father of Sheba, and that Sir Tristram pulled the horse's nose-bag over The Dean, which the Model Answer does not address. While the Model Answer partially aligns with the Gold Answer, it misses key facts and includes hallucinated information."
