    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not mention who gave Cousin Cæsar his first lesson in the rewards of imagination. The context clearly identifies 'big-sis' as the person who provided this lesson, aligning with the Gold Answer. The Model Answer fails to address the question and contradicts the retrieved context."
