  "llm_answer": "The narrative depicts the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery through Blore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver and the process by which Major Tarver is ultimately accepted by Salome.\n\nBlore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver is a minor part of the narrative, but it sets the stage for the introduction of Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey into the established group at the Deanery. When Blore is told to show in Major Tarver, he is instructed to let the gentlemen in, which leads to the introduction of Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey to Salome and Sheba.\n\nThe process by which Major Tarver is ultimately accepted by Salome is a more significant part of the narrative. Major Tarver is introduced as a middle-aged, tall, angular officer who is in a state of great excitement and depression due to his love for Salome. He is described as being in a \"terrible condition\" and is supported by Mr. Darbey, who is a mere boy with a pompous, patronizing manner.\n\nMajor Tarver's proposal to Salome is a pivotal moment in the narrative. He proposes to her in a dramatic and romantic manner, declaring that he has loved her \"distractedly\" for eight weeks. Salome is initially resistant to his proposal, but eventually accepts him, and the two share a tender moment together.\n\nThe acceptance of Major Tarver by Salome is facilitated by the presence of Mr. Darbey, who provides a comedic foil to the romantic drama unfolding between Major Tarver and Salome. Mr. Darbey's patronizing manner and his attempts to mediate the situation between Major Tarver and Salome add to the humor and lightheartedness of the scene.\n\nOverall, the narrative depicts the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery through the introduction of Major Tarver and Mr. Darbey, and the acceptance of Major Tarver by Salome. The scene is characterized by a mix of romance, comedy, and drama, and sets the stage for further developments in the narrative.",
