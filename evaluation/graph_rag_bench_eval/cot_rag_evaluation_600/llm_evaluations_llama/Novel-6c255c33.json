    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct title of the literary work, 'Prometheus Bound,' which is explicitly stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the Model Answer incorrectly claims that the title is not mentioned in the context and speculates about her essays instead, which is unsupported by the retrieved context. This results in a lack of correctness, faithfulness, and evidence coverage."
