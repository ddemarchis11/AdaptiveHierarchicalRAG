    "explanation": "The Model Answer states 'Insufficient evidence to answer the question,' which is incorrect. The Gold Answer clearly identifies the Portuguese Ambassador as the envoy who took leave of the King, and this information is not contradicted by the retrieved context. The Model Answer fails to provide the correct response and does not utilize the context effectively."
