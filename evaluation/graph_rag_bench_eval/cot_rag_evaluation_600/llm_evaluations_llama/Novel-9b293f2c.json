  "question": "Who is identified in the narrative as being the king of the Chaldeans, particularly in the context of early Mesopotamian history?",
  "gold_answer": "King Urukh was king of the Chaldeans.",
  "llm_answer": "Insufficient evidence to identify the king of the Chaldeans.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Gold Answer clearly identifies King Urukh as the king of the Chaldeans, which is supported by the Retrieved Context mentioning the signet cylinder of King Urukh. The Model Answer incorrectly states that there is insufficient evidence to identify the king, contradicting both the Gold Answer and the Retrieved Context."
