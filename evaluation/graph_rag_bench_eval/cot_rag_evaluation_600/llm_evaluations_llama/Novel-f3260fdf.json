  "llm_answer": "The reasoning path that links Mayab to the goddess Maia of Greece is as follows:\n\n1. The author notes that the name \"Maya\" is found in various cultures, including the American Maya language, the Sanskrit language, and the Greek language.\n2. In the American Maya language, \"Maya\" refers to a wise magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, and a powerful Asoura (demon).\n3. In the Sanskrit language, \"Maya\" refers to a goddess, the mother of all beings that exist - gods and men.\n4. In the Greek language, \"Maia\" is mentioned as a goddess, the mother of the gods, and is said to be the daughter of Atlantis.\n5. The author suggests that the name \"Maya\" is also found in the name \"Mayab\", which refers to a country in the West, known for its porosity of soil.\n6. The author notes that the inhabitants of Mayab took the name \"Maya\" from the country and called themselves \"Mayas\".\n7. The author suggests that the Mayas may have been the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants of the valley of the Nile and became the lords and masters of the land.\n8. The author notes that the Mayas deified and paid divine honors to their eminent men and women after their death, and that this worship of their heroes was carried to other countries where they emigrated.\n9. The author suggests that the Mayas may have originated from beyond the Atlantic waters, as indicated by the fact that Maya is born from Atlantis in Greek mythology.\n10. The author notes that the goddess Maia is also associated with the god Kubeles, who is said to be the road or the origin of the gods.\n11. The author suggests that the Mayas may have had a similar mythology and culture to the ancient Chaldeans, who were known for their knowledge of astronomy and mathematics.\n12. The author notes that the names of the Chaldean gods and goddesses have a natural etymology in the American Maya language.\n13. The author suggests that the Mayas may have been the ones who founded the city of Ur, which was the capital of the Chaldeans.\n14. The author notes that the Mayas are also found in Asia Minor, where the Carians established themselves after spreading terror among the populations bordering on the Mediterranean.\n15. The author suggests that the Carians may have come from the parts of the world where the Mayas originated, particularly since the goddess Maia is said to be the daughter of Atlantis.\n\nOverall, the author's reasoning path is based on a series of coincidences and similarities between the Mayas and other cultures, including the Sanskrit, Greek, and Chaldean cultures. The author suggests that the Mayas may have been a powerful and influential people who spread their culture and mythology to other parts of the world.",
