  "llm_answer": "The orange trees were located within the fortified nunnery compound, specifically in the courtyard or garden area, as mentioned in the following passages:\n\n* \"Through the cool morning vapors, hot smoke from smouldering wreckage mounted thin and straight, toward where the pale disk of the moon dissolved in light. The convex field stood bare, except for a few overthrown scarecrows in naked yellow or dusty blue, and for a jagged strip of earthwork torn from the crest, over which the Black Dog thrust his round muzzle. In a truce of empty silence, the defenders slept by turns among the sand-bags. The day came, and dragged by without incident. The sun blazed in the compound, swinging overhead, and slanting down through the afternoon. At the water gate, Rudolph, Heywood, and the padre, with a few forlorn Christians,--driven in like sheep, at the last moment,--were building a rough screen against the arrows that had flown in darkness, and that now lay scattered along the path. One of these a workman suddenly caught at, and with a grunt, held up before the padre. The head was blunt. About the shaft, wound tightly with... (Novel-10321_c_28)\"\n* \"The lantern skipped before them across the garden, through a penitential courtyard, and under a vaulted way to the main door and the road. With Rudolph, the obscure garden and echoing house left a sense of magical ownership, sudden and fleeting, like riches in the Arabian Nights. The road, leaving on the right a low hill, or convex field, that heaved against the lower stars, now led the wanderers down a lane of hovels, among dim squares of smoky lamplight. Wu, their lantern-bearer, had turned back, and they had begun to pass a few quiet, expectant shops, when a screaming voice, ahead, outraged the evening stillness. At the first words, Heywood doubled his pace. 'Come along. Here's a lark--or a tragedy.' Jostling through a malodorous crowd that blockaded the quarrel, they gained the threshold of a lighted shop. Against a rank of orderly shelves, a fat merchant stood at bay, silent, quick-eyed, apprehensive. Before him, like an actor in a mad scene, a sobbing ruffian, naked to the waist, convulsed with passion, brandished wild fists and ranted with incredible sounds. (Novel-10321_c_115)\"\n* \"He caught his rifle from the compradore's hand, but needed no draught from any earthly cup. Brushing through the orange trees, he made for the northeast angle, free of all longing perplexities, purged of all vile admiration, and fit to join his friends in clean and wholesome danger. (Novel-10321_c_79)\"\n* \"Chantel laughed heartily, and stretched his legs at ease under the table. [Illustration: Portuguese Nunnery:--Sketch Map.] 'What strategy!' he chuckled, preening his moustache. 'Your mythical siege--it will be brief! For me, I vote no to that: no rice-Christians filling their bellies--eating us into a surrender!' He made a pantomime of chop-sticks. 'A compound full, eating, eating!' One or two nodded, approving the retort. Heywood, slightly lifting his chin, stared at the speaker coldly, down the length of their council-board. The red in his cheeks burned darker. 'Our everlasting shame, then,' he replied quietly. 'It will be everlasting, if we leave these poor devils in the lurch, after cutting them loose from their people. Excuse me, padre, but it's no time to mince our words. We made them strangers in their own land. Desert 'em? Damned if we do!' No one made reply. The padre, who had looked up, looked down quickly, musing, and smoothed his white hair with big fingers that somewhat trembled. 'Besides,' continued the speaker, in a tone of apology, 'we'll need 'em to man the works. Meantime, you chaps must lend coolies, eh? Look here.' With rising spirits, he traced an eager finger along the map. 'I must run a good strong bamboo scaffold along the inside wall, with plenty of sand-bags ready for loopholing--specially atop the servants' quarters and pony-shed, and in that northeast angle, where we'll throw up a mound or platform.--What do you say? Suggestions, please!' Chantel, humming a tune, reached for his helmet, and rose. He paused, struck a match, and in an empty glass, shielding the flame against the breeze of the punkah, lighted a cigarette. 'Since we have appointed our dictator,' he began amiably, 'we may repose--' From the landing, without, a coolie bawled impudently for the master of the house. 'Wutzler!' said Heywood, jumping up. 'I mean--his messenger.' He was gone a noticeable time, but came back smiling. 'Good news, Gilly.' He held aloft a scrap of Chinese paper, scrawled on with pencil. 'We need expect nothing these ten days. They wait for more ammunition--'more shoots,' the text has it. The Hak Kau--their Black Dog--is a bronze cannon, nine feet long, cast at Rotterdam in 1607. He writes, 'I saw it in shed last night, but is gone to-day. O.W.' Gentlemen, for a timid man, our friend does not scamp his reports. Thorough, rather? Little (Novel-10321_c_133)\"\n* \"Afterward, when he was no longer with them, his two friends recalled that he never spoke again that night, but came and went in a kind of silent rage, ordering coolies by dumb-show, and carrying armful after armful of supplies to the water gate. He would neither pause nor answer. The word passed, or a listless, tacit understanding, that every one must hold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile boats should leave the river. 'If,' said Gilly to Rudolph, while they stood thinking under the stars, 'if his boat is still there, now that he--after what we saw.' At dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampans stealing up-river on the early flood; but of the masts that huddled in vapors by the farther bank, they had no certainty until sunrise, when the green rag and the rice-measure appeared still dangling above the Hakka boat. Even then it was not certain--as Captain Kneebone sourly pointed out--that her sailors would keep their agreement. And when he had piled, on the river-steps, the dry wood for their signal fire, a new difficulty rose. One of the wounded converts was up, and hobbling with a stick; but the other would never be ferried down any stream known to man. He lay dying, and the padre could not leave him. All the others waited, ready and anxious; but no one grumbled because death, never punctual, now kept them waiting. The flutter of birds, among the orange trees, gradually ceased; the sun came slanting over the eastern wall; the gray floor of the compound turned white and blurred through the dancing heat. A torrid westerly breeze came fitfully, rose, died away, rose again, and made Captain Kneebone curse. 'A fair wind lost,' he muttered. 'Next we'll lose the ebb, too, be 'anged.' Noon passed, and mid-afternoon, before the padre came out from the courtyard, covering his white head with his ungainly helmet. 'We may go now,' he said gravely, 'in a few minutes.' No more were needed, for the loose clods in the old shaft of their counter-mine were quickly handled, and the necessary words soon uttered. Captain Kneebone had slipped out through the water gate, beforehand, and lighted the fire on the steps. But not one of the burial party turned his head, to watch the success or failure of their signal, so long as the padre's resonant bass continued. When it ceased, however, they returned quickly through the little grove. The captain opened the great gate, and looked out eagerly, craning to see through the smoke that poured into his face. 'The wasters!' he cried bitterly. 'She's gone.' The Hakka boat had, indeed, (Novel-10321_c_133)\"\n\nThe orange trees were located in the courtyard or garden area of the fortified nunnery compound, near the water gate and the northeast angle.",
