    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed narrative about Bruin's relationship with the grandmother, emphasizing friendship and mutual support. However, it does not directly address the specific sequence mentioned in the Gold Answer, which is that Bruin settled in the cottage, the grandmother's home. While the Model Answer includes relevant details about Bruin's role and connection to the grandmother, some claims (e.g., Bruin being invited to the woodmouse's son's wedding) are not supported by the retrieved context. Additionally, the core fact from the Gold Answer is not explicitly stated, leading to partial correctness and evidence coverage."
