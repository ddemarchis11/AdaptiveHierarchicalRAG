Angeline offered to help Ruth financially, stating that she would help Ruth \"in every thing\" and that Ruth could \"go through the scientific course\" in two years after next spring term if she came to McGrawville that term.\n3. Ruth eventually returned to McGrawville in 1854, but remained only two months due to poor health, and Angeline was supportive of her decision.\n4.
