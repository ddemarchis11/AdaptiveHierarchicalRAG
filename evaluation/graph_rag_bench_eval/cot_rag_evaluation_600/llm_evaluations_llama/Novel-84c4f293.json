    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies that Mr. Pepys arranged a collation for 'Sir Williams,' while the Model Answer incorrectly identifies the guests as Captain Allen, his daughter Rebecca, and Mr. Hempson. Although the Model Answer is grounded in the retrieved context, it fails to align with the Gold Answer and misses the key factual point about 'Sir Williams.'"
