    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the Bey's roles and actions, including the use of bastinado, the palace in Toser, administration as Bey of the Camp, carrying a present to the Britannic Majesty, and issuing orders to Arabs. However, it introduces unsupported details such as sending a present to 'R.' and interactions with Turkish infantry, which are not directly relevant to the question. While the core facts align with the Gold Answer, the additional claims reduce faithfulness and evidence coverage."
