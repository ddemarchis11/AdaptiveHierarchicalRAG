    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.5,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the syrinx and harp as instruments used by the ancient Greeks, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, the mention of the drum is not explicitly supported by the retrieved context, and its inclusion is speculative. While the Model Answer attempts to provide additional context, it does not fully ground all claims in the provided text, leading to partial correctness and faithfulness. Evidence coverage is also partial, as the drum's use is not definitively established in the context."
