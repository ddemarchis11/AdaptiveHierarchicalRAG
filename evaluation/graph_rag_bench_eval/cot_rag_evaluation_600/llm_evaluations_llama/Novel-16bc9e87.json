    "explanation": "The Model Answer states that the evidence does not explicitly mention the origin of General Pearce's army, which is incorrect as the Gold Answer specifies Arkansas. The retrieved context does not provide information about General Pearce or his army, so the Model Answer is faithful to the context but fails to answer the question correctly or cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
