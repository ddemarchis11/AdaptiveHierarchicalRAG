  "gold_answer": "Hamburg was involved through the Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent, which reviewed Tristram Shandy and was edited by Bode.",
  "llm_answer": "The city of Hamburg was involved in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, especially through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'.\n\nBode, a resident of Hamburg, was exceptionally proficient in English and was the editor of the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' from 1762-3. He may have been the reviewer of 'Tristram Shandy' in the journal, as the style of the review matches his later translations of Sterne's works.\n\nThe 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' was a journal that devoted a remarkable amount of space to British affairs, and it was published in the North German seaport city of Hamburg. In January 1762, the journal mentioned Sterne's name for the first time in Germany, stating that he had departed for Paris in pursuit of lost health.\n\nBode later published his own version of 'Tristram Shandy' in 1769, which was a revised edition of the previous translation. He also acknowledged that some of the corrections were suggested by a reviewer, possibly the same one who reviewed the book in the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent'.\n\nIn 1769, Bode published a second edition of his translation of 'Tristram Shandy', which included a preface that mentioned his controversy with a critic and his acknowledgment of the help he received from Ebert and Lessing. The preface also mentioned that the excellence of his work was due to Ebert and Lessing, and that he had allowed himself frequent minor changes of word or phrase in the text.\n\nOverall, the city of Hamburg played a significant role in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, particularly through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'.",
