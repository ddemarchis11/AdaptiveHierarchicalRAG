    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not contain information about Raegen's wish to hide in the cellar and garret, as mentioned in the Gold Answer. However, the Model Answer fails to provide the correct response to the question, which is clearly stated in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not address the core factual point required by the question."
