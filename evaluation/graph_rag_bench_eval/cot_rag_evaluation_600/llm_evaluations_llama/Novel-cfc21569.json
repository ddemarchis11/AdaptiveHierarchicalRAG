  "question": "When Raegen is fleeing the police after a violent encounter, where does he wish to hide in order to avoid being caught, and why does he consider these locations safe?",
  "gold_answer": "Raegen wanted to lie hidden in his own cellar and his own garret.",
  "llm_answer": "I cannot find any information about Raegen in the provided text.",
  "scores": {

    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question about Raegen's hiding locations and reasons for considering them safe. It incorrectly states that no information about Raegen is available, despite the Gold Answer providing specific details. The Retrieved Context does not contain relevant information about Raegen either, but the Model Answer does not utilize internal knowledge to provide a correct response."
