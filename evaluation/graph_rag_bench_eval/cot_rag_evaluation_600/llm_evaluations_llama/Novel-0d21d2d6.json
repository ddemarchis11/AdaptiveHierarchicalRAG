  "question": "Which character did Brindle Bill express disbelief toward during the discussion about the inheritance and family matters?",
  "gold_answer": "Brindle Bill did not believe Rose.",
  "llm_answer": "I cannot identify which character Brindle Bill expressed disbelief toward during the discussion about the inheritance and family matters.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct information that Brindle Bill did not believe Rose, as stated in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context in acknowledging the inability to identify the character, it does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer, resulting in low correctness and evidence coverage scores."
