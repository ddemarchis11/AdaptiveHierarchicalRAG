  "question": "In the narrative describing Hinze's social behavior, how does Hinze interact with both Tulpian and Felicia, particularly in his fervent desire to hear Tulpian's opinions and his manner of engaging in conversation with Felicia?",
  "gold_answer": "Hinze is fervid in his desire to hear Tulpian and actively engages in conversation with Felicia.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, Hinze interacts with both Tulpian and Felicia in the following ways:\n\n1. **Interaction with Tulpian:** Hinze is described as being fervent in his desire to hear Tulpian's opinions, particularly on his crotchets. He is said to be \"troublesome to bystanders\" in asking them if they have read Tulpian's writings. Hinze delights in the citation of opinions and would hardly remark on a subject without an air of respectful appeal or fervent adhesion. He is described as figuratively carrying a small spoon to pick up any dusty crumb of opinion that Tulpian may have let drop.\n\n2. **Interaction with Felicia:** Hinze's interaction with Felicia is described as being overly reverent and admiring. When Felicia delivers her opinions on various subjects, Hinze is impressed and responds with a tone of deep conviction, saying things like \"That is true indeed\" and \"You have put your finger with strict accuracy on the causes of decline.\" He is described as being \"rapt in attention\" and \"subdued in eagerness of inquiry.\" Hinze's behavior is seen as an \"attitudinising deference\" rather than a genuine direct admiration.\n\nIn general, Hinze's interactions with both Tulpian and Felicia are characterized by his desire to be agreeable and to make a good impression. He is described as being unconscious of falsity and not having enough deep and lasting impression to find a contrast or diversity between his words and his thoughts.",
