  "question": "In the narrative, which group is described as having customs similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan, based on the comparison of cultural practices?",
  "gold_answer": "The Carians had customs similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan.",
  "llm_answer": "Based on the provided evidence, the group described as having customs similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan is the Carians, or Caras, or Caribs. This is mentioned in the following passage:\n\n\"To tell you that the name of the CARAS is found over a vast extension of country in America, would be to repeat what the late and lamented Brasseur de Bourbourg has shown in his most learned introduction to the work of Landa, \"Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan;\" but this I may say, that the description of the customs and mode of life of the people of Yucatan, even at the time of the conquest, as written by Landa, seems to be a mere verbatim plagiarism of the description of the customs and mode of life of the Carians of Asia Minor by Herodotus.\"\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that the customs and mode of life of the people of Yucatan are similar to those of the Carians of Asia Minor, and that the worship of the same divinities under the same name is also similar.",
