  "llm_answer": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, the consumption of alcohol impacts the brain's ability to function in the following ways:\n\n1. It deadens the nerves, so that they cannot carry their messages correctly.\n2. It makes the head ache.\n3. It prevents clear thinking.\n4. It interferes with the nerves that carry the brain's messages.\n\nThe primer states that alcohol \"puts the nerves to sleep\" and \"cheats men into thinking they can do more than they really can.\" It also explains that this false feeling of strength lasts only a little while, and when it has passed, men feel weaker than before.\n\nAdditionally, the primer notes that a story told by a ship captain shows that alcohol does not give strength. The captain found that his sailors were not made stronger by drinking rum, but rather felt weaker after a little while.\n\nThe primer also explains that a little alcohol is not so bad as a great deal, but even a little makes the head ache and hurts the brain and nerves. It warns that a body kept pure and strong is of great service to its owner, and that people who drink liquor, even in small amounts, slowly poison their bodies and are less able to bear sickness.",
