  "question": "How did Rudolph demonstrate his engagement with different cultures during his travels in Dragon's Blood, such as by speaking English and journeying to China as part of his experiences?",
  "gold_answer": "Rudolph demonstrated engagement with different cultures by speaking English and traveling to China.",
  "llm_answer": "The provided evidence does not contain any information about Rudolph demonstrating engagement with different cultures by speaking English or traveling to China.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide evidence for Rudolph's engagement with different cultures by speaking English or traveling to China. However, it fails to answer the question directly using internal knowledge or reasoning, which would have been possible given the Gold Answer. Thus, the answer is incorrect in terms of correctness and evidence coverage, but faithful to the provided context."
