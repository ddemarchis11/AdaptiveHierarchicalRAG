    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Dr. Elsie Inglis's contributions to Serbia, including her travel, leadership of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals, and efforts during the typhus epidemic. It also accurately describes the Serbian people's recognition of her support, such as the dedication of a fountain and referring to her as 'the angel of their people.' However, it omits the detail about Serbian officers carrying her coffin after her death, which is a key fact from the Gold Answer."
