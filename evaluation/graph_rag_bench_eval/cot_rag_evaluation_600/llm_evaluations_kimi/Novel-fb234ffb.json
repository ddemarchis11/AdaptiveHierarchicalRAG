  "question": "In what way was the city of Hamburg involved in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, especially through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'?",
  "gold_answer": "Hamburg was involved through the Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent, which reviewed Tristram Shandy and was edited by Bode.",
  "llm_answer": "Hamburg’s role in the reception of Sterne’s works in Germany was pivotal, primarily through the activities of Johann Joachim Christoph Bode and the *Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent*. Bode, a resident of Hamburg and editor of the paper from 1763, was instrumental in promoting Sterne’s works. The *Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent* not only provided early coverage of Sterne—such as the 1762 report on his departure for Paris—but also served as a platform for reviews and discussions of *Tristram Shandy*. Bode later produced his own German translation of *Tristram Shandy*, published in Hamburg in 1774, further cementing the city’s role in disseminating Sterne’s literature in Germany.",
