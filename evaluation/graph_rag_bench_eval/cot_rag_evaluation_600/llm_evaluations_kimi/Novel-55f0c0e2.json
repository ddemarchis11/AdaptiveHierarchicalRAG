    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that there is no mention of the Duke of York sending Samuel Pepys an official order, whereas the context does include an incident where Pepys received an order from the Duke of York regarding the ships. The Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context but fails to correctly interpret or address the question and misses the key fact from the Gold Answer."
