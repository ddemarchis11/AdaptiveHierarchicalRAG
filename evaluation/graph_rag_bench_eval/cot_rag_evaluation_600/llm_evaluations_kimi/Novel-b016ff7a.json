  "question": "What is the significance of the mustang in the interactions between Grey and Cota at the Ramierez fonda, considering that Grey threw himself across the mustang and Cota cared only for the horse?",
  "gold_answer": "Grey threw himself across the mustang, and Cota cared only for the horse.",
  "llm_answer": "The mustang is the focal point of Grey’s and Cota’s first real contest of wills at the Ramierez fonda.  \nGrey throws himself across the pinto mare to prove he can master what Cota values; Cota, in turn, shows she cares only for the horse, not for Grey’s victory or its wounds.  \nThus the mustang becomes the single object through which each character tests and reveals their power over the other.",
