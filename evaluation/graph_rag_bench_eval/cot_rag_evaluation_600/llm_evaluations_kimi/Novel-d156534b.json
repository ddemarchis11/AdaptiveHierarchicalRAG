  "question": "How is the goddess Ceres linked to Jupiter through a chain involving Love and Iasius?",
  "gold_answer": "Love inflamed Ceres, who beheld Iasius, who was the son of Jupiter.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows that Ceres is linked to Jupiter through a chain involving Love and Iasius as follows:\n\n1. Iasius is described as “the son of Jupiter and Electra” (Novel-47676_c_139), so Jupiter is Iasius’s father.  \n2. Ceres “enjoyed the favour of” Iasius and by him became the mother of Plutus (Novel-47676_c_139).  \n3. While watching Iasius on Crete, Ceres is overcome: “on the one side Shame, on the other Love, inflamed her. Shame was conquered by Love” (Novel-47676_c_67).  \n\nThus the chain is: Jupiter → Iasius (via father-son) → Love (Ceres’s passion for Iasius) → Ceres.",
