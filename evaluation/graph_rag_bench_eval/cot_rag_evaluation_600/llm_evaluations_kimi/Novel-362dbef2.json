    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Emily Dow as a member of the stock company at the People's theater, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it also includes Azelene Allen as a member, which is supported by the context but not mentioned in the Gold Answer. This addition makes the answer partially correct in terms of evidence coverage, as it introduces an extra detail not required by the Gold Answer."
