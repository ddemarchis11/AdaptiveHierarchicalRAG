    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies Yucatan as the region with luxuriant vegetation, but the Model Answer incorrectly identifies the plain near Tagodast instead. The retrieved context does not mention Yucatan or support the claim about Tagodast being the region characterized by luxuriant vegetation. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and does not cover the evidence from the Gold Answer."
