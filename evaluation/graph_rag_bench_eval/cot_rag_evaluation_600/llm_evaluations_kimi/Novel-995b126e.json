  "llm_answer": "The chain links Ovid’s writing to the theme of Love through the narrative sequence as follows:\n\n1. Ovid begins in heroic hexameter, intending to sing of arms and violent war (Evidence [Novel-47676_c_74], footnotes 003–004).  \n2. Cupid intervenes, steals a foot from the hexameter, and forcibly converts the poem to the elegiac couplet (hexameter + pentameter), the metre of love poetry (Evidence [Novel-47676_c_74], footnote 005 and line 010).  \n3. The poet immediately capitulates: “Henceforth, in six feet let my work commence; in five let it close. Farewell, ye ruthless wars …” (Evidence [Novel-47676_c_1]).  \n4. In the next elegy he admits he is already Cupid’s captive, wears the poet-lover’s chains, and will parade in Cupid’s triumph (Evidence [Novel-47676_c_1]).  \n5. Later, when Tragedy rebukes him for wasting talent on love-themes, the personified Elegy answers that she and Cupid are inseparable: “Without myself, the mother of wanton Love were coy; of that Goddess do I show myself the patroness and the confidant” (Evidence [Novel-47676_c_49]).  \n\nThus the narrative sequence—metrical coercion, personal surrender, public triumph, and finally a defence of love-elegy—binds every stage of Ovid’s writing to the governing theme of Love.",
