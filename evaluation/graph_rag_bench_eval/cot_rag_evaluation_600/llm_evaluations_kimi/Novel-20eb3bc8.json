  "gold_answer": "Don Carlo defied and fought Brindle Bill, and was identified as the Hero of Shirt-Tail Bend.",
  "llm_answer": "The conflict between Don Carlo and Brindle Bill is portrayed as a physical and moral showdown that defines the social order of Shirt-Tail Bend. Brindle Bill, the bully of the settlement, dominates through intimidation and gambling, while Don Carlo, though silent and burdened by his brother Dan’s wasteful alliance with Bill, ultimately defies him.\n\nDon Carlo defies Brindle Bill by descending the chimney into “headquarters,” raking the gambling money off the table, and refusing to back down when Bill demands a fight. In the ensuing bare-knuckle contest Don’s “true pluck” matches Bill’s strength; a lucky blow from Don draws first blood. The fight is broken up when Simon’s wife sets fire to the cane pile; the flames drive everyone outside and end the brawl. With Bill’s “fear of him was broken” and his appeals for support ignored, Brindle Bill leaves the settlement. Don Carlo keeps the money and is thereafter hailed as “the Hero of Shirt-Tail Bend.”",
