  "question": "During the supper scene described in the cottage, which foods are specifically mentioned as being served to the characters?",
  "gold_answer": "The supper includes ham, gingerbread, white bread, and jugs of buttermilk.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence provided does not mention any specific foods served during a supper scene in a cottage. Therefore, I cannot determine which foods were served based on the given text.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about the foods served during the supper scene in the cottage. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or external grounding, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. The Gold Answer specifies the foods served, but the Model Answer does not address this, resulting in low correctness and evidence coverage scores."
