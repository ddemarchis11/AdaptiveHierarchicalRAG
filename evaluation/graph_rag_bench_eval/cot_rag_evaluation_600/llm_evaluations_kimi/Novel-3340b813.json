  "question": "How does the novel describe the commercial activities of Fez, including its trade with other parts of Morocco and its role as a departure point for caravans to Timbuctoo, within the broader African context?",
  "gold_answer": "Fez has trade with Morocco and sends caravans to Timbuctoo.",
  "llm_answer": "The novel describes Fez’s commercial activities as immense, giving it “almost the air of an European city.” In the great square Al-Kaisseriah “is exhibited all the commerce of Europe and Africa—nay, even of the whole world,” with daily crowds “as at a fair.” Fez sends out two annual caravans: one departs for Central Africa/Timbuctoo, travelling via Tafilett and Touat and taking about ninety days; the other is the pilgrimage caravan to Mecca. Thus Fez functions as a major departure point for trans-Saharan trade and pilgrimage within the broader African context.",
