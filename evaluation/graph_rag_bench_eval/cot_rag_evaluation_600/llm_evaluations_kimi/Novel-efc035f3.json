    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies that Mrs. B. made her remarks to Miss Inglis, but the Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not specify to whom the remarks were made. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it fails to include the key fact from the Gold Answer and does not address the question correctly."
