  "question": "In the scene where an ill-looking man enters Toto's cottage and searches the kitchen, what objects did the man open while looking for valuables?",
  "gold_answer": "Boxes",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer mentions the drawer containing the six silver teaspoons and the porringer, which is supported by the context. However, the Gold Answer specifies 'boxes' as the objects opened while searching for valuables, which is broader and includes other items mentioned in the context. The Model Answer partially aligns with the Gold Answer but misses the broader scope of 'boxes' and other items opened."
