  "question": "In the context of surveying as discussed in the text, for what purpose is the determination of latitude needed?",
  "gold_answer": "Latitude is needed for determination of true meridian.",
  "llm_answer": "The determination of latitude is needed in surveying to enable the accurate calculation of the azimuth of Polaris, which in turn allows the establishment of a true meridian for surveying purposes.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 1.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly explains that latitude is needed for determining the azimuth of Polaris, which is essential for establishing a true meridian. This aligns with the Gold Answer and is supported by the Retrieved Context, which discusses the relationship between latitude, azimuth, and the true meridian in surveying. The Model Answer provides additional relevant details without deviating from the core truth."
