  "question": "How is the identity of the Dean established within the narrative, considering his role as the father of Sheba, his alternate name as Augustin, his interactions with Darbey, and the information he receives from Sir Tristram?",
  "gold_answer": "The Dean is the father of Sheba, is also known as Augustin, sees Darbey, and is told information by Sir Tristram, establishing his identity and central role.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence establishes the Dean’s identity through four converging facts:\n\n1. Father of Sheba: Sheba repeatedly calls him “Papa” (Novel-40700_c_27, c_28).  \n2. Alternate name Augustin: Georgiana greets the recovering Dean with “How do you feel now, Gus?” (Novel-40700_c_61), confirming “Gus”/Augustin is the same man.  \n3. Interactions with Darbey: Darbey addresses him as “my dear Dean” and is personally invited by him to visit (Novel-40700_c_29), showing the Dean’s public clerical role.  \n4. Information from Sir Tristram: Sir Tristram calls the Dean “Jedd, old boy” (Novel-40700_c_61) and later formally introduces him to Noah as “Dr. Jedd, the Dean of St. Marvells” (Novel-40700_c_69), supplying both given name and ecclesiastical title.\n\nThus, within the narrative he is simultaneously Sheba’s father, nicknamed Augustin/Gus, socially interacting with Darbey, and officially identified by Sir Tristram as Dr. Jedd, Dean of St. Marvells.",
