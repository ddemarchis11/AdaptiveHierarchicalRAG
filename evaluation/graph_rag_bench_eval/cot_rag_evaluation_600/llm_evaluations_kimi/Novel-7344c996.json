  "question": "How does the coke fire contribute to the revivification of bone-black within the furnace system?",
  "gold_answer": "The coke fire produces flames that heat the retorts, which are used to revivify bone-black.",
  "llm_answer": "The coke fire built in the fire-place, Y, spreads its flames throughout the fire chamber, directing them toward the bottom. These flames divide into two parts, heating the backs of the retorts as they pass, and then rise through the lateral flues, V, uniting to form a single current in the drier. This heating action within the furnace system accomplishes the revivification of the bone-black.",
