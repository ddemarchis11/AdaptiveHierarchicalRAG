  "question": "Drawing from Augustus Le Plongeon's analysis in 'Vestiges of the Mayas,' what evidence is presented for connections between the Mayas and the Egyptians, and what relationships or comparisons are described between the Mayas and the civilizations of the Asiatic peninsulas?",
  "gold_answer": "The Mayas had many customs and attainments identical to those of the Egyptians, were compared to the Egyptians, and had relations with Asiatic peninsulas.",
  "llm_answer": "Evidence for connections between the Mayas and the Egyptians:\n\n- Le Plongeon lists “many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians” as “identical to those of the Mayas.”  \n- He notes that Egyptian religious rites and habits unknown to the Mayas exist, but stresses that the Egyptians “always pointed towards the West as the birth-place of their ancestors” and “worshiped as gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still in MAYAB.”  \n- The hieroglyphic sign the Egyptians used for “Lord” or “Master” was the image of a sieve; the same sign was employed to write the name of Egypt itself. Le Plongeon points out that the peninsula the Mayas inhabit is called Mayab, meaning “a sieve,” and that its inhabitants took that name. He therefore suggests that the western invaders who became “lords and masters” of the Nile valley may have come from Mayab.\n\nRelationships or comparisons between the Mayas and the civilizations of the Asiatic peninsulas:\n\n- Le Plongeon states that the religious lore and customs shared between the Mayas and the peoples of the Asiatic peninsulas are “too few to justify” the claim that the Mayas received their civilization from them; instead, these commonalities “would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them at some epoch or other.”  \n- He observes that “in the figures sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American,” indicating a reciprocal iconographic resemblance.",
