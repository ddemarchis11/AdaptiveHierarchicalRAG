    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information about whom Asaph Hall helped protect during a public event in Boston. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. The Gold Answer specifies Wendell Phillips, but this fact is not addressed in the Model Answer."
