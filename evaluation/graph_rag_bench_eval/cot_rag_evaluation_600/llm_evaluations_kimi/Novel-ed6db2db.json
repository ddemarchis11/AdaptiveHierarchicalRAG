  "question": "Trace the reasoning path from Mayab’s similarity with Hindostan to the Mayas' conflict with the Spanish.",
  "gold_answer": "Mayab has similarity with Hindostan; Hindostan has Mayas; Mayab is a country of the Mayas, who fought the Spanish.",
  "llm_answer": "The reasoning path is:\n\n1. The text asserts that the types (physical features) of the people of Mayab are “very similar to the features of the bearded men carved on the pillars of the castle … at Chichen-Itza,” while their “warlike habits recall those of the Mayas, who fought so bravely and tenaciously the Spanish invaders.”  \n   → This directly links the inhabitants of Mayab to the Maya of Yucatán and explicitly recalls the Maya armed resistance against the Spanish.\n\n2. The same passage notes that “many of the names of their villages and tribes are pure American-Maya words,” reinforcing the identification of these people as Maya.\n\n3. Therefore, the recognition of Mayab’s similarity with Hindostan (based on shared names, customs, architecture, etc.) is part of a broader argument that the Maya culture extended beyond Yucatán; once that Maya identity is established, the text simply reminds the reader that these same Maya “fought so bravely and tenaciously the Spanish invaders,” i.e., engaged in the well-known Maya–Spanish conflicts.",
