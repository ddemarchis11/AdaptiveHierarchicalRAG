  "question": "In the narrative describing Hinze's social behavior, how does Hinze interact with both Tulpian and Felicia, particularly in his fervent desire to hear Tulpian's opinions and his manner of engaging in conversation with Felicia?",
  "gold_answer": "Hinze is fervid in his desire to hear Tulpian and actively engages in conversation with Felicia.",
  "llm_answer": "Hinze’s interaction with Tulpian is marked by an almost greedy reverence: he “carries about a small spoon ready to pick up any dusty crumb of opinion that the eloquent man may let drop,” fervently presses Tulpian to dilate on even his most trivial crotchets, and pesters bystanders to attend to those crotchets as well. With Felicia, the manner is the same “subdued ecstasy”: he bends his head, lifts his eyes in rapt attention, puts large questions, and after each of her answers recapitulates her words “with threads of compliment,” treating every commonplace remark as though it were an oracle.",
