    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Constant Woodward was wounded at Bull Run, while the Model Answer incorrectly identifies Jasper Woodward. The context confirms that both Constant and Jasper Woodward were wounded, but Constant is explicitly mentioned as the individual who paused to take a last shot and was wounded at Bull Run. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect in identifying Jasper instead of Constant. The Model Answer is faithful to the context but fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
