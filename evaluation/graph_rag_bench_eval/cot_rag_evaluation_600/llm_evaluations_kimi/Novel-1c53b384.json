  "question": "What is the historical significance of Chaacmol in Maya history as described in the narrative, considering his funeral chamber at Chichen, the research conducted by Augustus Le Plongeon, and the circumstances of his death at the hands of Aac?",
  "gold_answer": "Chaacmol had a funeral chamber at Chichen, was studied by Augustus Le Plongeon, and was killed by Aac.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence provided describes Chaacmol as a Maya prince who was killed by his brother Aac out of jealousy, because Chaacmol had married their sister Moo. This event is depicted in the mural paintings of Chaacmol’s funeral chamber at Chichen-Itza. Augustus Le Plongeon conducted research on this chamber, noting its elaborate construction and the detailed frescoes that illustrate not only Chaacmol’s life and death but also the customs and attire of his time. The chamber’s design and contents—such as the placement of organs in stone urns and the depiction of dying warriors—suggest a significant ceremonial and cultural importance attached to Chaacmol’s death and legacy.",
