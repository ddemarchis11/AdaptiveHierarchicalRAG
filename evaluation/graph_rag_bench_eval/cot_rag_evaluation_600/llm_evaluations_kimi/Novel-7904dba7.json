    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not specify any notable feature of the settler's cabin, whereas the Gold Answer clearly identifies 'the light' as the notable feature. The retrieved context does not explicitly contradict the Gold Answer, but the Model Answer fails to address the question correctly and does not align with the Gold Answer or the context."
