  "llm_answer": "Dr. Elsie Inglis was a member of the Women’s Liberal League and served as Honorary Secretary to the Scottish Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies. Within the Women’s Liberal League, she was on its first committee and used her drawing-room for meetings, later helping shift the League toward educational and social-legislative work. As Honorary Secretary of the Scottish Federation, she shaped its policy between 1906 and 1914, using her organisational talent to co-ordinate suffrage activity across Scotland. These positions allowed her to channel the organised strength of Scottish suffrage societies into the creation of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals, thereby turning the women’s-rights network into a nationally praised war-time medical service and demonstrating the practical value of women’s citizenship.",
