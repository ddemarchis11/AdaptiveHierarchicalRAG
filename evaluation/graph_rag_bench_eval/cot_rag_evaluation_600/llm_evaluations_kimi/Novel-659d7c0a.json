    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not mention the huehuetl and teponaztli, which are the specific instruments identified in the Gold Answer. Instead, it lists other instruments (whistles, pipes, drums, and bells) that are not supported by the retrieved context as being used by the Aztecs. This makes the answer incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and lacking coverage of the key facts."
