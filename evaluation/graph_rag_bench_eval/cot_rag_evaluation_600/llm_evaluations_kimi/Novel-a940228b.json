  "question": "Retell the story of Corinna’s farewell to her parrot as if you are Corinna, writing in her personal diary. Include the role of Isis as invoked in the triplets.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today was a day of sorrow. My beloved parrot, companion and confidant, was snatched away by envious fate, taken from my side. I said my farewells with heavy heart. In my grief, I called upon Isis, hoping she would turn her features to me and grant comfort. The gods are distant, yet my pain feels as if I am born to be a cause of trouble to my lover.",
  "llm_answer": "Diary of Corinna  \n(undated, the night after the seventh day)\n\nI write by lamplight, my eyes still hot with tears. My little echo, my feathered mimic, is gone. All week I fasted, I sat in Isis’ temple on her appointed days, the Galli twining laurels while I prayed—not for myself this time, but for the small green life that perched on my shoulder and learned every cadence of my voice. I had hoped the Goddess, who keeps the serpent coiled around her altars and lets the horned Apis walk in her train, would turn her face toward us and spare him. I promised her frankincense, white robes, an inscription: “Naso, for the preservation of Corinna’s parrot, offers these.” Yet the seventh dawn arrived, and with it his faltering breath.\n\nHe took only a nut at breakfast, a drop of water at noon; poppies lulled him to sleep each dusk. Today his tongue, always quicker than any bird’s, managed one last sentence—my name, and farewell—before the thread snapped. I laid him in a coffin no larger than his body, set a stone above it: “From this very tomb I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress. I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.”\n\nI imagine him now in the Elysian grove reserved for innocent birds: holm-oak shade, ever-green grass, swans, the Phoenix, Juno’s peacock, and my chatterer among them, calling newcomers with human words. If Isis rules there too, may she let him keep his voice.\n\nI close this page; the lamp flickers like his last heartbeat. Vale, my echo. Corinna.",
