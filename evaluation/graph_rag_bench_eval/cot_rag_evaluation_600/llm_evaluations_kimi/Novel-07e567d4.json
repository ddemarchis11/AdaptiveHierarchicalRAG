    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Raegen wished to hide in the river, which is not supported by the Gold Answer or the Retrieved Context. The Gold Answer specifies that Raegen wanted to hide in the cellar and the garret, and the context does not mention the river as a hiding place during the specific attempt to evade the police. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and fails to cover the key facts."
