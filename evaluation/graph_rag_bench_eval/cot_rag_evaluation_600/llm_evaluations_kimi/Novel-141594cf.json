  "question": "How does the narrative depict the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery, specifically through Blore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver and the process by which Major Tarver is ultimately accepted by Salome?",
  "gold_answer": "Major Tarver is shown being introduced by Blore and ultimately accepted by Salome, illustrating the process by which new individuals are incorporated into the group.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence does not show Blore being told to show in Major Tarver; it is Sheba who instructs Blore to admit the visitors.  \nThere is no scene in the supplied text in which Salome explicitly “accepts” Major Tarver into the group; the passages end before any such moment occurs.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that Sheba instructs Blore to admit the visitors, which aligns with the context. However, it does not fully address the narrative's depiction of Major Tarver's integration into the group or Salome's acceptance of him, as described in the Gold Answer. While the context does not explicitly show Salome accepting Tarver, the Gold Answer interprets the narrative as illustrating the process of integration, which the Model Answer does not sufficiently explore."
