    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Raegen wishes to hide on the roofs, which is not supported by the Gold Answer or the Retrieved Context. The Gold Answer specifies that Raegen wanted to hide in his own cellar and garret, and the context does not provide evidence for the claim about Cherry Street tenements or the roofs being his intended hiding places."
