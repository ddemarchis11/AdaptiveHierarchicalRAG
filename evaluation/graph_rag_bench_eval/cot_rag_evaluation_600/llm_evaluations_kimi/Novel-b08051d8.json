  "question": "According to the subgraphs, how is potash involved in the manufacturing of telescopes?",
  "gold_answer": "Potash is used for making glass, which is then used to make telescopes.",
  "llm_answer": "The provided evidence does not mention telescopes or any connection between potash and telescope manufacturing.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not mention telescopes or potash's role in telescope manufacturing. However, it fails to answer the user's question using external knowledge or reasoning, which is necessary since the Gold Answer provides the correct information that potash is used for making glass, which is then used to make telescopes. The Model Answer does not address this core fact, leading to a low score for correctness and evidence coverage."
