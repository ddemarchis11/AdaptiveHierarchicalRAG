    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that Frank Moore worked for the Minnesotian newspaper and later served in the Civil War, but it does not fully address the bridging of journalism and military service as mentioned in the Gold Answer. While the context supports his involvement in both areas, the Model Answer does not elaborate on the connection or transition between these spheres, which is central to the question. The answer is faithful to the context but lacks full evidence coverage and completeness."
