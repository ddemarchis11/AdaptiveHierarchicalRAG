  "question": "Imagine you are launce, a fish found at Lizard. Write a diary entry about the day the boat ventured into your cave.",
  "gold_answer": "Launce’s Diary: The day was peaceful until a boat, with John Curgenven aboard, entered our cave. The water stirred as the boat’s shadow passed over us. The other fishes, always chasing me, seemed distracted by the newcomers. I kept close to the rocks at Lizard, wary of both humans and my fellow fish.",
  "llm_answer": "Diary of a Launce  \nLizard Cave, night the boat came  \n\nThey thrust their shell of wood right through my silvered door; moonlight that usually guides us to the sand was shattered by a rocking shadow. I darted beneath the prow, but the cave walls flung back the thud of their oars like thunder. Spears of lantern-light stabbed the green, picking out our flickering shoal; we twisted, flashed, hid among the rose-pink ledges while the iron beak pressed farther into the black throat I have never dared swim. A pistol cracked—sound rolled over and over the vaulted roof until I felt it in my spine. Then the keel grated, spun, retreated; daylight spilled again through the mouth, and quiet returned, save for the tremor still quivering in every fin.",
