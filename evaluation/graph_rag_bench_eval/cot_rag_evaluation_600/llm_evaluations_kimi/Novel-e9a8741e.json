  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.5,

    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the Foreign Office made stipulations with Dr. Inglis, which is supported by the context. However, it misses the specific mention of the Scottish Women's Hospitals, which is a key fact in the Gold Answer. While the context does confirm Dr. Inglis's involvement, the omission of the organization reduces evidence coverage and correctness."
