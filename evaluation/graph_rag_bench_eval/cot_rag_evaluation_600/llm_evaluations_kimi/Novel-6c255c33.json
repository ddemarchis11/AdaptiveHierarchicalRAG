    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not specify the title of any literary work read by C. A. S. Hall later in life. The Gold Answer clearly identifies 'Prometheus Bound' as the work she read, which is not mentioned or acknowledged in the Model Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it fails to address the question correctly and misses the key fact provided in the Gold Answer."
