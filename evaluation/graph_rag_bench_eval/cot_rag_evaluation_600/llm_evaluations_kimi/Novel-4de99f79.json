    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Tregeagle's dwelling was in Cornwall, which is a broader location. The Model Answer specifies Dozmare Pool, which is supported by the Retrieved Context but does not align with the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it fails to match the Gold Answer and misses the broader factual point."
