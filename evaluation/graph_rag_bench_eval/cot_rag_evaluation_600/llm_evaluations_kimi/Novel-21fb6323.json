  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows that, after the conquest, the British government raised no objection to the use of French in the law-courts; hence French was allowed in judicial proceedings. When the first parliament of Lower Canada met in 1792, the Assembly’s French-speaking majority pressed for, and obtained, official recognition of French on an equal footing with English.",
