  "question": "After the King's appointment of my Lord as Embassador, how do my Lord's subsequent actions—such as thanking Sir R. Slingsby and issuing orders to Mr. Creed—illustrate the distribution of royal favor and delegation of responsibilities within the court?",
  "gold_answer": "After the King made my Lord Embassador, my Lord thanked Sir R. Slingsby and ordered Mr. Creed, illustrating the distribution of royal responsibilities.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows two concrete instances of how royal favor and responsibility are distributed after the King appoints the narrator’s Lord as Ambassador.\n\n1. Royal favor to Sir R. Slingsby: at the garden stairs the Lord “thanked him for his kindness to me,” publicly acknowledging Slingsby’s past support. This thanks, coming from a newly elevated Ambassador, visibly extends the King’s favor to Slingsby.\n\n2. Delegation to Mr. Creed: the Lord orders Mr. Creed “to imprest so much upon me to be paid by Alderman Backwell,” thereby entrusting Creed with the administrative task of releasing £300 for cloth purchases. This illustrates how the Lord, acting under royal authority, delegates financial responsibility within the court hierarchy.",
