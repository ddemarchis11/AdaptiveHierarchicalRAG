  "question": "In the narrative's exploration of skeletal structure and childhood development, how is the spine described in terms of its composition, and what characteristics of children's bones and growth—such as the ease with which bones bend and the tendency for children to outgrow their shoes—are highlighted?",
  "gold_answer": "The spine is made of bones; bones bend easily in children, who are always out-growing shoes.",
  "llm_answer": "The spine is described as being made of twenty-four small bones, with an elastic cushion of gristle between each pair.  \nChildren’s bones contain more gristle than those of older people, so they bend easily.  \nThe narrative also notes that healthy children are always out-growing their shoes.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly describes the spine as being made of bones with elastic cushions between them, which aligns with the Gold Answer. It also accurately highlights the characteristics of children's bones (more gristle, bending easily) and the tendency for children to outgrow their shoes, all of which are supported by the Retrieved Context. The additional detail about the spine's composition (24 small bones) is relevant and grounded in the context."
