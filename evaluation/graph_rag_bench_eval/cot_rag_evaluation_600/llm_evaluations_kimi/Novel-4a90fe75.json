    "explanation": "The Model Answer claims that the evidence does not specify a single named place as the primary home for Toto and his grandmother, which contradicts the Gold Answer ('Cottage'). The context does mention a cottage as the setting where Toto, his grandmother, and other characters reside, making the Gold Answer correct. The Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context but fails to align with the Gold Answer and misses the key fact of 'Cottage.'"
