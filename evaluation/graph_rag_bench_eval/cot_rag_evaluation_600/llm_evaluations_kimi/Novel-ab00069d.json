  "question": "What evidence is provided in the novel of diplomatic relations between the Empire of Morocco and Great Britain, such as treaties and their ratification by Sultan Muley Ahmed-elt-Thabceby?",
  "gold_answer": "The Empire of Morocco has treaties with Great Britain, and Sultan Muley Ahmed-elt-Thabceby ratified a treaty with Great Britain.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence provided in the novel regarding diplomatic relations between the Empire of Morocco and Great Britain includes the following:\n\n1. **Initial Relations**: Diplomatic relations officially began during the times of Elizabeth I or Charles I of England, though no formal treaty was concluded at that stage.\n\n2. **Formal Treaty of Peace**: A formal treaty of peace was concluded in the last year of the reign of George I (likely 1727). This treaty was ratified in 1729 by George II and by Sultan Muley Ahmed-elt-Thabceby, referred to as \"The golden.\"\n\n3. **Subsequent Treaties**: After the initial treaty, various other treaties were established to ensure the security of persons and trade and to combat piracy.\n\n4. **Consolidated Treaty**: The most significant and still-active treaty mentioned is the one signed at Fez on 14th June 1801, which was later confirmed on 19th January 1824 by Sultan Muley Suleiman. This treaty is considered the primary framework governing British-Moroccan relations.\n\nThese points are directly supported by the provided evidence.",
