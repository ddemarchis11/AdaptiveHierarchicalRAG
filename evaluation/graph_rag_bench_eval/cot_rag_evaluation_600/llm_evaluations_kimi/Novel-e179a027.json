    "explanation": "The Gold Answer specifies that Rudolph went up the wall, which is a clear and concise response to the question. The Model Answer incorrectly states that the evidence does not specify where Rudolph went, which contradicts the Gold Answer and fails to address the question correctly. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it does not provide the required factual information and misses the key detail from the Gold Answer."
