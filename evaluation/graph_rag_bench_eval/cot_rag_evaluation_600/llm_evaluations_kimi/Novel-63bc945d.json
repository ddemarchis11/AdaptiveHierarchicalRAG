  "question": "How are the legal, familial, and romantic storylines intertwined through the engagement of Roxie Daymon to Simon, Simon's obtaining a promise from Rose Simon, and Governor Morock's offer to arrange testimony for Roxie Daymon?",
  "gold_answer": "Roxie Daymon was engaged to Simon, Simon obtained a promise from Rose Simon, and Governor Morock offered to arrange the testimony for Roxie Daymon.",
  "llm_answer": "The evidence shows three inter-locking threads:\n\n1. Legal/financial  \n   - Young Simon, already mortally ill, dictates a will that leaves “his whole estate, worth more than a million of dollars,” to Roxie Daymon; Governor Morock writes and witnesses it.  \n   - After Simon’s death Morock offers to “arrange the testimony” (and later to secure several hundred bales of cotton) if Roxie will pay him thousands, thus tying the validity of the inheritance to the lawyer’s manipulable evidence.\n\n2. Familial  \n   - Simon’s father had feared the claim of “Roxie Daymon” because a twenty-year-old twenty-thousand-dollar debt (plus interest) was owed to the Fairfield heirs; the father’s dying words, “Take Roxie Daymon away,” set the stage.  \n   - Simon’s kinsman Rose Simon (née Fairfield) is persuaded by Simon to let him “manage the business”; Simon produces witnesses who swear Rose is the only surviving Fairfield heir, so the bank pays the money to Simon and Rose, extinguishing the claim that might have competed with Roxie’s.\n\n3. Romantic  \n   - Young Simon and Roxie Daymon meet on the boat, become “engaged to be married the following spring at Chicago,” and the engagement is the personal bond that explains why the dying man leaves everything to her.\n\nThus the engagement provides the emotional link between Roxie and Simon; Simon’s obtaining Rose’s consent lets him eliminate the rival Fairfield claim; and Governor Morock’s offer to arrange testimony secures the legal pathway by which Roxie may keep the fortune Simon has willed her.",
