  "question": "Imagine you are the Duke of Wellington. Write a diary entry about your efforts to emancipate the Catholics and your thoughts on the Irish and English relations.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today I continued my advocacy for Catholic emancipation. I am aware that the Catholics of this era know the necessity of modesty, especially considering their Irish heritage. There is a sentiment in high places that the Irish have been too lenient toward the English, and yet, England itself is a nation with a sense of common descent and unity. My hope is that these reforms will foster greater harmony across all these groups.",
  "llm_answer": "Diary of Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington  \n[undated, but evidently 1829, the year of the Catholic Relief Act]\n\nI have this day done what none of my ancestors would have thought possible, and what many of my English friends call treason: I have advised the King to give his assent to the Emancipation of the Catholics.  I have used all the authority that a soldier and a Minister can possess to force this measure through both Houses, and I have done it without the smallest illusion as to the hatred it will earn me.\n\nThe evidence of my own senses, and of every dispatch that reaches me from Ireland, shows that the old policy of exclusion has failed.  For years we have told the Irish Catholic that he must be modest because he is Irish, and that he must be content to be ruled by a Church to which he does not belong.  The result has been not gratitude but sullen disaffection, and, in the countryside, the growth of secret combinations that no amount of coercion can extinguish.  My own name, once a rallying-cry for loyalty, is now hissed at in some Irish towns because I carried the Bill; yet I would rather be hissed in Dublin than see another crop of midnight proclamations and burnt hay-ricks.\n\nI have listened to the English gentlemen who speak of the Constitution as though it were a family portrait that must never be re-hung.  They forget that the same Constitution once denied the Canadian Catholics the right to sit in their own Assembly, until we discovered that conciliation turned French subjects into loyal Britons.  The parallel is exact: concession in Canada preserved the connection; obstinacy at home would have snapped it.\n\nI do not expect love from the Irish in return for what I have done; I expect only that they will now seek their redress within the law rather than outside it.  If that expectation is disappointed, the fault will lie not in the measure but in those who administer it.  As for myself, I have placed the safety of the United Kingdom above the applause of my own party; and if I am therefore to be reckoned no longer an Englishman, I must endure that sentence with the same composure with which I have faced other enemies.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer captures the essence of the Gold Answer, discussing Catholic emancipation, Irish-English relations, and the hope for harmony. However, it introduces unsupported details, such as specific events and sentiments not grounded in the retrieved context, like the mention of Canadian Catholics or Wellington's personal reflections. While the core message aligns with the Gold Answer, the additional details reduce faithfulness and evidence coverage."
