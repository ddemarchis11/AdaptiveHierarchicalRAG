    "explanation": "The Model Answer contradicts the Gold Answer by stating that Miss Trotter did not resign from the Summit House, whereas the Gold Answer explicitly mentions her resignation. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it fails to align with the Gold Answer and misses the key facts about Miss Trotter's resignation and her selection of Frida Jansen for a position."
