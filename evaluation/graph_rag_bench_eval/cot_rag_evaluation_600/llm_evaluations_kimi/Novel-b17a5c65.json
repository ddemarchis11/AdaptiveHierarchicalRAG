  "question": "In the scenes where Latimer meets with the bishop to ask for Ellen's hand in marriage, how does the bishop's demeanor reveal both his confidence in Latimer and his role as a judge of Latimer's character and intentions?",
  "gold_answer": "The bishop had confidence in Latimer, spoke with him, and was judging him.",
  "llm_answer": "The bishop’s demeanor shifts from paternal regret to judicial scrutiny, showing both confidence in Latimer and his role as a judge of character. Initially he speaks “gloomily” of losing his daughter, yet assures Latimer, “I am only too sure you will not be found wanting,” openly declaring, “I like you very much.” This warmth demonstrates trust. However, his tone hardens: “he was now facing a judge … and … Latimer … was in turn the defendant,” and he demands answers to a moral test, stating, “as you answer that I will tell you whether or not you can have Ellen.” Thus, the bishop’s manner moves from affectionate confidence to deliberate, authoritative interrogation, revealing his dual role as both supportive father and final arbiter of Latimer’s worthiness.",
