  "question": "Imagine you are the spine. Write a diary entry about how you help the body move and grow, especially in children.",
  "gold_answer": "Dear Diary, As the spine, I form the backbone of the chest and keep everything upright. I'm made of bones, and in children, those bones bend easily as they grow. I work closely with muscles and help support the lungs and heart inside the chest, which is made up of the spine, ribs, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones. It's a big responsibility, but I like helping children grow tall and strong!",
  "llm_answer": "Diary of the Spine  \nToday I held up my young owner again while she ran, jumped, and grew another tiny fraction of an inch.  I am a stack of twenty-four small bones with springy cushions between each one; every time she bends I squeeze those cushions on the inner edge and stretch them on the outer, then let them spring back the moment she stands straight.  Without me she would jolt like a wheelbarrow without springs.  My ribs curve out from me—twelve on each side—making the strong chest-box that guards her heart.  When she leans over her book I remind her to sit tall, for while she is young my bones still hold more gristle than lime and can be bent out of shape; if she forgets, she may grow round-shouldered or even hump-backed.  So I keep steady, helping her body move and grow, one careful day at a time.",
