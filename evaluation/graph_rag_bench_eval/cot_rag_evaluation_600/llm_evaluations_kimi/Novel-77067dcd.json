  "gold_answer": "The harp is in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript, which is in the British Museum, which has cymbals that were used by Egyptians.",

  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 1.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that there is no evidence in the retrieved context establishing a connection between the harp in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript and the cymbals used by Egyptians. This aligns with the Gold Answer, which implies a connection but lacks explicit evidence in the provided context. The Model Answer is faithful to the context and accurately reflects the absence of such a connection."
