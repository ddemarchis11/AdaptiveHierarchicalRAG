  "question": "Imagine you are Young Simon. Write a diary entry about your family connections and your feelings about the events involving your cousin Cæsar and Roxie.",
  "gold_answer": "As the only son of S. S. Simon, I often hear stories about our family. My cousin, Cæsar, has been at the center of recent events, from delivering a note to the Governor to helping Simon learn about Roxie's family. I hear Roxie has been charged, and I worry for her. Our family feels so interconnected, especially with big-sis raising Cæsar and our ties to the Carlow and Brindle families.",
  "llm_answer": "**Diary of Young Simon**  \n*Aboard the Roman Eagle, Mississippi River, 1860*\n\nCousin Cæsar has at last told me the whole truth. The estate—twenty thousand with twenty years’ interest—hangs like a mill-stone round my neck, and Roxie Fairfield, the quiet girl who calls herself “poor trash,” is the very heir who can lift it. I sat with her this evening on the aft-guard, her hand lying light against mine, and felt the weight lift a little. She knows nothing of her mother’s sisters, Rose and Suza, only what old Aunt Patsey Perkins called “poor trash.” I could not speak the word “twenty” aloud; the Angel of Caution stopped my tongue.  \n\nI love her. I love her for her honesty, for the way she says “I am nothing but poor trash too” without shame. I love her because she does not know yet that she can save me. When we dock in Chicago we are to marry in the spring. Cousin Cæsar will witness; he has carried the secret so long that silence has become his second skin.  \n\nI saw the Governor write the will—ten dollars only, and every acre, every bale, every slave I own passes to Roxie. Cæsar stood bewildered when the papers printed it, but I would do it again. Let the world call her fortune-hunter; I call her salvation. If I die before the wedding, she will still have the name Daymon and the wealth that should have been hers by blood.  \n\nThe image of her face stays between me and every beautiful woman I pass. I carry it like a silver dollar against my heart.",
