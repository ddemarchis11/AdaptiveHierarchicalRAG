  "question": "Describe, within the context of the furnace used for revivifying bone-black, how the energy transformation process begins with the coke fire in the fire-place producing flames, which then heat the retorts where the bone-black is placed for revivification.",
  "gold_answer": "The coke fire in the fire-place produces flames that heat the retorts, enabling them to revivify bone-black placed inside.",
  "llm_answer": "The energy transformation begins when a coke fire is built in the fire-place, Y. The flames produced spread throughout the fire chamber, direct themselves toward the bottom, divide into two parts to the right and left, and heat the back of the retorts, D, in passing.",
