  "gold_answer": "Fez has trade with Morocco and sends caravans to Timbuctoo.",
  "llm_answer": "The novel describes Fez as a major commercial hub, with an immense trade of every kind carried on at the city. The great square, Al-Kaisseriah, is said to exhibit all the commerce of Europe and Africa, and even the whole world. The city has two annual caravans, one to Central Africa or Timbuctoo, and another to Mecca or the caravan of pilgrims.\n\nThe caravan to Timbuctoo is described as taking about 90 days to complete, while the Mecca caravan takes around 4-6 months to reach Alexandria. The value of the investments in this caravan is estimated to be around a million dollars, indicating the significant economic importance of Fez's trade with other parts of Africa.\n\nFez's trade with other parts of Morocco is also mentioned, with the city serving as a departure point for caravans to the interior, passing through Wadnoun to the south. The city's commercial quarter, Kaessaria, is described as extensive, exhibiting every species of manufacture and natural product, including silks, embroidery, and leather.\n\nThe novel also highlights Fez's role as a major hub for trade with other parts of Africa, particularly with the Sahara and Timbuctoo. The city's trade with these regions is facilitated by its location at the foot of the Atlas mountains, which provides access to the river Tensift and other trade routes.\n\nIn the broader African context, Fez's commercial activities are described as being part of a larger network of trade routes and caravans that connect the city to other parts of the continent. The novel mentions the city's trade with Timbuctoo, which was a major center of commerce and learning in West Africa, and its trade with Mecca, which was a major center of Islamic learning and culture.\n\nOverall, the novel portrays Fez as a major commercial hub that plays a significant role in the trade and commerce of Africa, connecting the city to other parts of the continent and facilitating the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures.",
