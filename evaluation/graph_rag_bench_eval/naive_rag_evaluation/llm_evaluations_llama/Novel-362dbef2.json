    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Emily Dow as a member of the stock company at the People's theater, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces Azelene Allen and Harry Gossan, which are mentioned in the context but not directly relevant to the specific question about actresses. Additionally, the claim about Harry Gossan's sister being Emily Dow is unsupported by the context. This reduces both faithfulness and evidence coverage."
