    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct name of the primary home, 'Cottage,' as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not explicitly describe the name or details of the home, making the Model Answer unfaithful to the context. The Model Answer also misses the key fact from the Gold Answer, which is the name 'Cottage.'"
