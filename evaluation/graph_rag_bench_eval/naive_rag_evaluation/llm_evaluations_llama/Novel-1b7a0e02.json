    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that there is no mention of Charles calling out excitedly upon seeing the lights during the first evening at The Lizard. The Gold Answer specifies that Charles called out 'The Lizard Lights,' and this is supported by the context, which mentions the Lizard Lights and their significance. The Model Answer fails to address the question correctly and contradicts the retrieved context."
