  "question": "During the siege of the nunnery in 'Dragon's Blood', where did Rudolph go when he ascended to a higher vantage point to participate in the defense?",
  "gold_answer": "Rudolph went up the wall.",
  "llm_answer": "Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention Rudolph ascending to a higher vantage point to participate in the defense.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,

    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not provide information about Rudolph ascending to a higher vantage point or going up the wall. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge or external reasoning, which would have been possible given the Gold Answer. Thus, the answer is incorrect in terms of correctness and evidence coverage."
