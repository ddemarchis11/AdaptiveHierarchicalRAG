    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between Mayab and Hindostan, but it introduces several unsupported claims and interpretations not found in the retrieved context. While it correctly identifies a cultural and historical connection and mentions Maya in Hindostan, it adds details about customs, traditions, and mythology that are not explicitly supported by the context. The Gold Answer is concise and focuses on the similarity and presence of Maya in Hindostan, which the Model Answer partially addresses but expands upon in ways that are not fully grounded in the provided context."
