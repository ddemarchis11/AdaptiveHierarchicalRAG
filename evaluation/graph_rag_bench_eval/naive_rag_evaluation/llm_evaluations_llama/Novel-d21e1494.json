  "gold_answer": "Rubber boots can cause the pores on your feet to become clogged.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, wearing rubber boots indoors can cause the pores on your feet to become clogged because rubber prevents the perspiration from passing off. Perspiration is the waste matter and water that comes out through the tiny holes in the skin, called pores, and is carried off by tiny tubes. When rubber boots are worn indoors, the rubber prevents the perspiration from escaping, causing the pores to become clogged.\n\nThis can lead to discomfort and health issues. The clogged pores can cause the feet to feel uncomfortable, and in severe cases, it can lead to other problems. Additionally, if the pores become clogged, it can also cause the head to ache, indicating that the body is experiencing stress due to the blocked pores.\n\nIt's worth noting that the primer advises wearing rubber boots outdoors when the ground is wet, as they are useful in such situations. However, it's essential to remove them as soon as you come indoors to prevent the pores from becoming clogged.",
