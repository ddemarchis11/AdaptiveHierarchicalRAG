    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed list of uses and products derived from trees, but it includes information not directly supported by the retrieved context, such as tobacco-related products and uses of other trees like sycamore and redwood. While the core uses of Sugar Maple (furniture, sugar, cooking, warmth) are mentioned, the additional details dilute the focus and introduce unsupported claims. The Gold Answer is more concise and focused on Sugar Maple, which the Model partially addresses but misses some nuances."
