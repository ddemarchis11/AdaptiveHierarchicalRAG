    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies slate as the type of quarry found in Washington County, New York, whereas the Gold Answer specifies sandstone. The retrieved context does not support the claim about slate quarries in Washington County, but it does mention sandstone quarries. Therefore, the Model Answer is faithful to the context but fails to provide the correct information or cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
