  "question": "Within the novel's discussions about the identity of Ovid's beloved, who was Corinna suspected to be?",
  "gold_answer": "Julia",
  "llm_answer": "According to the footnote, Corinna was suspected to be Julia, either the daughter or the grand-daughter of the emperor Augustus. However, this is not considered a strong theory by the commentators, and it is more likely that Corinna was an ideal personage existing in the imagination of the poet, Ovid, representing his favourite mistress for the time being.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Julia as the suspected identity of Corinna, aligning with the Gold Answer. It also provides additional context from the retrieved material, explaining that this theory is not strongly supported and suggesting Corinna might be an idealized figure. All claims are grounded in the retrieved context, and the key fact (Julia) is included."
