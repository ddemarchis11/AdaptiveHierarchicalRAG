  "question": "After his experiences in Monte Carlo, where did Louis intend to return with his wife, as discussed in their conversation?",
  "gold_answer": "Louis would go back to Paris.",
  "llm_answer": "There is no mention of a person named Louis or his wife in the provided text. The text actually mentions a person named Harringford, who is the main character in the first part of the text, and then switches to a different narrative in the second part of the text, which appears to be a diary entry from a different character.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not mention Louis or his wife, nor their intentions to return to Paris. However, it fails to answer the question directly, which is about Louis's intentions, and does not align with the Gold Answer. The context does not provide relevant information about Louis, so the model's response is faithful to the context but does not address the question or include the key fact from the Gold Answer."
