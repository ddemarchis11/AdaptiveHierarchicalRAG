  "llm_answer": "Elsie Maud Inglis leveraged both local support and international resources to support the work of the Scottish Women's Hospitals in Serbia. \n\nLocally, she sent Miss Burke as a representative to speak and fill the Treasury chest of the S.W.H. Miss Burke was 'found' by Dr. Inglis in the office of the London Society and was sent forth to speak and fill the Treasury chest of the S.W.H. It is written in the records of that work how wonderfully Miss Burke influenced her countrymen in America, and how nobly, through her efforts, they have aided 'the great adventure.'\n\nInternationally, Dr. Inglis received support from America. In a letter to Lady Frances, Miss Burke wrote that she was one of Dr. Elsie's children and that it was largely due to her intuition and clear judgment of character that her feet were placed in the path which led to her reaching her maximum efficiency as a hospital worker and a member of the Scottish Women's Hospitals. Miss Burke also mentioned that Dr. Elsie had given her responsibility and that she had spoken French fluently, which was a testament to Dr. Inglis' ability to identify and utilize the skills of her team members.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Inglis' work in Serbia was supported by the American Red Cross. The U.S.M.S. St. Paul, which was mentioned in the letter, was likely a ship that was used to transport aid and supplies to Serbia.\n\nDr. Inglis also received support from the Serbian government. Colonel Miliantinovitch and Colonel Tcholah Antitch were mentioned in a letter as being kind to the Scottish Women's Hospitals and were asked to be shown hospitality by the London Committee.\n\nOverall, Dr. Inglis was able to leverage both local support and international resources to support the work of the Scottish Women's Hospitals in Serbia.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly captures the core idea of Elsie Maud Inglis leveraging local support (Miss Burke's efforts) and international resources (American aid) for the Scottish Women's Hospitals in Serbia, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces unsupported claims, such as the involvement of the American Red Cross and the U.S.M.S. St. Paul as a transport ship, which are not grounded in the retrieved context. Additionally, while the Model Answer mentions Miss Burke's influence in America, it does not fully elaborate on the specific international aid mobilized by Elsie Inglis, as described in the Gold Answer. Thus, while correct in essence, it lacks full evidence coverage and includes partially unsupported details."
