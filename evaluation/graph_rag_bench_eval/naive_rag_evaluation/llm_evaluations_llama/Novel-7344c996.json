  "question": "How does the coke fire contribute to the revivification of bone-black within the furnace system?",
  "gold_answer": "The coke fire produces flames that heat the retorts, which are used to revivify bone-black.",
  "llm_answer": "The coke fire contributes to the revivification of bone-black within the furnace system by heating the retorts and the surrounding area. The flames from the coke fire spread throughout the fire chamber, direct themselves towards the bottom, and then divide into two parts to the right and left, heating the back of the retorts in passing. The two currents then mount through the lateral flues and unite to form one current in the drier. This heat is then used to revivify the bone-black as it passes through the retorts and the drier.",
