  "llm_answer": "Frank Moore played a significant role in bridging the worlds of journalism and military service in St. Paul. Before serving in the Civil War, he worked as a printer's \"devil\" for the Minnesotian newspaper, where he was exposed to the world of journalism and news gathering. \n\nAs a printer's \"devil,\" Moore's duties included carrying water for the office, meeting boats to collect newspapers, and serving as a half-carrier staff member, delivering papers to the city above Wabasha street. This experience likely gave him a strong foundation in the newspaper industry and an understanding of the importance of timely news.\n\nMoore's transition from journalism to military service during the Civil War reflects the close ties between the two fields in St. Paul during that time. Many newspapermen, including Moore, saw military service as a way to serve their country and contribute to the war effort. Moore's experience in journalism likely influenced his ability to serve as a volunteer in the Civil War, where he would have been exposed to the realities of war and the importance of accurate reporting.\n\nAfter the war, Moore returned to his work in journalism, eventually becoming the superintendent of the composing room for the Pioneer Press. His experience in both journalism and military service likely gave him a unique perspective on the importance of accurate and timely reporting, as well as the role of the press in shaping public opinion.\n\nIn this sense, Frank Moore played a significant role in bridging the worlds of journalism and military service in St. Paul, demonstrating the close ties between the two fields during the Civil War era.",
