    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Mogador's status as part of Morocco is not explicitly mentioned and suggests British influence or control, which is unsupported by the context. The Gold Answer clearly states that Mogador is part of Morocco, and the context does not contradict this. The Model Answer fails to align with the Gold Answer and the retrieved context."
