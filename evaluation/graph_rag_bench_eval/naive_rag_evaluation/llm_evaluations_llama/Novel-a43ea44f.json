    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Rudolph stood with Heywood, while the Gold Answer specifies Mrs. Forrester. The retrieved context does not provide evidence to support the Model Answer's claim, nor does it confirm the Gold Answer. Therefore, the Model Answer is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and fails to cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
