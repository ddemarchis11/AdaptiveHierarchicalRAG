    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.5,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer partially aligns with the Gold Answer but introduces inaccuracies and misses some key details. While it correctly identifies Ulysses and Demophoôn as writers of letters, it incorrectly includes Paris to Oenonc, which is not supported by the context. Additionally, it omits Hippolytus and Jason, who are explicitly mentioned in the Gold Answer. The faithfulness score is reduced due to unsupported claims about Paris and incomplete grounding in the retrieved context."
