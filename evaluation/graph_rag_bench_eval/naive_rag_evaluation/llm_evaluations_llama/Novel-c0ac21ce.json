    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Gleim as the recipient of Heinse's correspondence, consistent with the Gold Answer and the Retrieved Context. It also adds the detail that the correspondence lasted until 1802, which is supported by the context and does not detract from the core truth of the Gold Answer."
