  "llm_answer": "During his encounter on the street while working as a trailer in the green-goods scheme, Snipes said something to the old man that advanced the plot. Specifically, he asked the old man, \"What do you want to see him about?\" This question was significant because it revealed that Snipes was supposed to be watching the old man, but the old man's behavior and words suggested that he was not a typical \"customer\" of the green-goods men.",
