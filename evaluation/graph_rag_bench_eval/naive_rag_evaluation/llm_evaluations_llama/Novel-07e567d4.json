    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question correctly, as it does not mention Raegen's wish to hide in the cellar and the garret, which is the core of the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide any information about Raegen's desire to hide in a specific location, making the Model Answer unfaithful to the context and irrelevant to the question."
