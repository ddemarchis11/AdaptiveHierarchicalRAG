  "llm_answer": "Earle S. Goodrich was the editor of the Pioneer. He prepared a huge joke on the Minnesotian by creating four or five columns of bogus telegraph news, which included a two-column speech purporting to have been made by William H. Seward in the senate just previous to the breaking out of the war. He had this bogus news set up and printed a few copies of the Pioneer for the Minnesotian to receive. The joke worked, and the Minnesotian was taken in by the fake news.",
