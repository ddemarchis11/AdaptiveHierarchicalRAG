  "gold_answer": "The Mayas lived in Central America.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative does not explicitly state the primary geographic location where the Mayas lived.

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Yucatan as a region associated with the Mayas, which aligns with the Gold Answer's mention of Central America. However, the retrieved context does not explicitly confirm Yucatan as the primary geographic location of the Mayas, nor does it directly state 'Central America.' The Model Answer partially relies on inference rather than explicit grounding in the context, leading to partial correctness and faithfulness. Additionally, it misses the concise identification of 'Central America' as stated in the Gold Answer."
