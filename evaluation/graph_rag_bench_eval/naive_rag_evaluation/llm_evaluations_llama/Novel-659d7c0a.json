    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not mention the huehuetl and teponaztli, which are the specific instruments identified in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer provides details about other instruments mentioned in the context, it fails to address the core question about the Aztec instruments specified in the Gold Answer. The information provided is faithful to the retrieved context but does not cover the key facts required."
