    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies Jasper and Captain Acker as individuals related to Angeline Hall who were wounded at the Battle of Bull Run. The Gold Answer specifies Constant Woodward as the correct individual, and the context supports this by describing how Constant was wounded at Bull Run. The Model Answer fails to mention Constant Woodward and instead provides unrelated or incorrect information, making it neither correct nor faithful to the context."
