    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the book discusses tobacco in the context of hygiene and is aimed at children in Primary Schools, which aligns with the retrieved context. However, it fails to explicitly name the book 'Child's Health Primer,' as stated in the Gold Answer. While the response is faithful to the context, it misses the specific identification of the book, leading to partial correctness and evidence coverage."
