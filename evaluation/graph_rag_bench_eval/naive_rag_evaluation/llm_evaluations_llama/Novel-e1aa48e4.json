    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed account of the Bey's roles and actions, but it includes numerous claims that are not explicitly supported by the retrieved context, such as issuing orders to various specific groups and locations. While the core roles mentioned in the Gold Answer are addressed (use of Bastinado, palace in Toser, administration as Bey of the Camp, carrying a present to the Britannic Majesty, and issuing orders to Arabs), the Model Answer introduces unsupported details and expands excessively beyond the scope of the context. This reduces faithfulness and evidence coverage."
