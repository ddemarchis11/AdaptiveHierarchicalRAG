  "llm_answer": "During their encounter after the battle, Cousin Cæsar did recognize Steve Brindle. However, the outcome of their meeting was not a pleasant one for Cousin Cæsar. He was shocked and dismayed to learn that Steve Brindle was now fighting for the federal army, which led Cousin Cæsar to mentally exclaim, \"Oh treacherous humanity! must I live to learn thee still Steve Brindle fights for m-o-n-e-y?\" This indicates that Cousin Cæsar felt betrayed by Steve's decision to switch sides, and their meeting ended on a sour note.",
