    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to identify Augustin Cuvillier as the member who voted against the Ninety-Two Resolutions, which is the core fact in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not provide information about the specific member, and the Model Answer does not use external knowledge to correctly answer the question. Therefore, it is incorrect, unfaithful to the context, and does not cover the key fact from the Gold Answer."
