    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct location where Dr. Wolfred Nelson was held as a prisoner, which is Montreal, as stated in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it does not address the specific factual point required by the question and misses the key evidence entirely."
