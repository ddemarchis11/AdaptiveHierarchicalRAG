    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not contain information about Asaph Hall's baptism in Ohio or the Midwest. However, it fails to answer the question using internal knowledge, which is expected when the context is irrelevant. The Gold Answer explicitly states Ohio, which the Model Answer does not provide."
