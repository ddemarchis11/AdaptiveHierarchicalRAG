  "question": "In the chapter where Trost discusses technological advancement, how does the text describe the relationship between the human organism and the machine, especially with regard to the idea that the machine is an extension of the human organism?",
  "gold_answer": "The machine is described as an extension of the human organism.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the text, Trost describes the relationship between the human organism and the machine as one of interdependence. He states that the machines are \"the slaves of our race, need our tendance and regulation, obey the mandates of our consciousness, and are only deaf and dumb bringers of reports which we decipher and make use of.\" This suggests that the machines are not autonomous entities, but rather tools that are created and controlled by humans.\n\nTrost also emphasizes that the machines are \"extensions of the human organism, so to speak, limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more subtle finger-tips, ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the invisibly small.\" This metaphor implies that the machines are an extension of human capabilities, allowing humans to perform tasks that would be impossible or impractical for them to do on their own.\n\nFurthermore, Trost notes that each new machine requires a new appliance of human skill to construct it, new devices to feed it with material, and often keener-edged faculties to note its registrations or performances. This highlights the idea that the machines are not a replacement for human capabilities, but rather a complement to them.\n\nOverall, the text suggests that the relationship between the human organism and the machine is one of symbiosis, where the machines are tools that are created and controlled by humans, and are used to extend and enhance human capabilities.",
