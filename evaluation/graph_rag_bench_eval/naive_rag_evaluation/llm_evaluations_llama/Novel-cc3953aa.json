  "question": "How does Mr. Darbey's status as an officer of the Hussars relate to his being seen by The Dean and spoken to by Sheba?",
  "gold_answer": "The Dean sees Darbey, Mr. Darbey is an officer of the Hussars, Sheba speaks to Mr. Darbey.",
  "llm_answer": "Mr. Darbey's status as an officer of the Hussars is mentioned in the context of the Fancy Dress Masked Ball at Durnstone, which is promoted by the Officers of the Hussars. However, when The Dean sees Mr. Darbey, he does not seem to recognize him as an officer, and instead addresses him as \"Mr. Garvey\". \n\nLater, when Sheba speaks to The Dean, she refers to Mr. Darbey as \"Mr. Darbey\", indicating that she knows his true identity. This suggests that Sheba is aware of Mr. Darbey's status as an officer, but The Dean is not.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides some relevant details about Mr. Darbey's status as an officer of the Hussars and his interactions with The Dean and Sheba, but it introduces unsupported claims, such as The Dean not recognizing Mr. Darbey as an officer, which is not grounded in the retrieved context. Additionally, it misses the simplicity and clarity of the Gold Answer, which directly states the key facts without unnecessary elaboration or assumptions."
