    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Mrs. B. made her remarks to people who watched Dr. Inglis coming to their thresholds, which is not supported by the context. The Gold Answer specifies that Mrs. B. made her remarks to Miss Inglis, and this fact is not mentioned or accurately reflected in the Model Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not support the claim made in the Model Answer, leading to a lack of faithfulness and evidence coverage."
