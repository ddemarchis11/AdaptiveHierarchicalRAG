    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Miss Trotter as the superior in charge of the Summit Hotel and mentions her selection of Frida Jansen for a position, which aligns partially with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces the detail that the selection was at the request of Mr. Calton's doctor, which is not clearly supported by the retrieved context. Additionally, the relationship between Miss Trotter's resignation and Frida Jansen's selection is not addressed, leading to partial correctness and incomplete evidence coverage."
