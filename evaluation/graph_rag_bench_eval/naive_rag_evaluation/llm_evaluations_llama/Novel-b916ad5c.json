  "question": "What chain of evidence links the kinnor to the British Museum’s collection of cymbals?",
  "gold_answer": "The kinnor is rendered as harp, which is in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript that is in the British Museum, which also has cymbals.",
  "llm_answer": "There is no chain of evidence linking the kinnor to the British Museum's collection of cymbals in the provided text. The text mentions the kinnor as an ancient instrument, but it does not mention the British Museum's collection of cymbals in relation to the kinnor.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that there is no chain of evidence linking the kinnor to the British Museum's collection of cymbals, whereas the Gold Answer provides a clear connection: the kinnor is rendered as a harp in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript housed in the British Museum, which also contains cymbals. The Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, as the context does not explicitly mention this connection, but it fails to align with the Gold Answer and misses the key facts entirely."
