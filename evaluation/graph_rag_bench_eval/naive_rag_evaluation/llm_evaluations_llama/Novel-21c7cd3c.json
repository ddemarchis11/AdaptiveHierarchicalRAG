    "explanation": "The Model Answer does not address the specific question about which literary work Goethe read aloud to his contemporaries. While it correctly states that Goethe read Sterne's works under Herder's guidance, this information does not answer the question. The Gold Answer explicitly identifies 'Tristram Shandy' as the work Goethe read aloud, which is not mentioned in the Model Answer. The Model Answer is faithful to the context but fails to provide the required evidence or answer the question correctly."
