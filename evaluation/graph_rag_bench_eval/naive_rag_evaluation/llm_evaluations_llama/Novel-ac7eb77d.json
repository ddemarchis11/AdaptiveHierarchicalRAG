    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed account of the Sultan's roles and powers, but it includes several claims that are not explicitly supported by the retrieved context, such as the Sultan being the 'head of the Empire's military' or the 'symbol of the Empire's power.' While the Gold Answer focuses on the Sultan's power over Morocco and his residence in a palace, the Model Answer expands significantly, introducing unsupported details about his despotism, judicial role, and limited power in certain regions. This reduces faithfulness and evidence coverage, as the core facts from the Gold Answer are not fully emphasized or accurately grounded in the context."
