    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that the retrieved context does not provide information connecting David to the santir or involving Egyptian musicians. However, it fails to address the Gold Answer, which provides a specific chain of relationships connecting David to the santir through the kinnor, cymbals, and Assyrian musicians. The Model Answer does not contain the core meaning of the Gold Answer and misses the required factual points."
