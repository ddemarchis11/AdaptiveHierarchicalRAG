  "question": "According to the discussion in the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER about bone flexibility, why are children's bones more flexible and able to bend easily compared to the bones of old people?",
  "gold_answer": "Bones bend easily in children, making their bones more flexible than those of old people.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the discussion in the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, children's bones are more flexible and able to bend easily compared to the bones of old people because they contain more gristle. Gristle is a soft, elastic part of the bone that allows it to bend and twist without breaking. As people age, their bones contain more lime, which makes them harder and more prone to breaking. This is why children's bones are more flexible and able to bend easily, while old people's bones are more brittle and prone to breaking.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly explains that children's bones are more flexible due to the presence of more gristle, as supported by the context. It also contrasts this with older people's bones, which contain more lime and are more brittle, aligning with the retrieved context and expanding on the Gold Answer without introducing unsupported details."
