  "question": "What is the relationship between the goddess Cybele and her priests, specifically the Galli and the Corybantes, as described in the narrative where Cybele is said to have priests called Galli and her original priests were known as Corybantes?",
  "gold_answer": "Cybele had priests called Galli, and her original priests were called Corybantes.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the narrative, the Galli, or priests of Cybele, performed her rites in a manner similar to the Corybantes, the original priests of Cybele. The Galli imitated the Corybantes by performing Cybele's rites to the sound of pipes and tambourines, and running to and fro in a frenzied manner. This suggests that the Galli were a continuation or a later group of priests who followed the same practices as the Corybantes, who were the original priests of Cybele.",
