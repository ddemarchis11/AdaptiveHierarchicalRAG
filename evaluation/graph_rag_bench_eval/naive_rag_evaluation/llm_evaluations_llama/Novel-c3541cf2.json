  "llm_answer": "The narrative reveals the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" and Augustin's role as the Dean. This use of nicknames and alternate identities serves to blur the lines between their personal and social identities, creating a sense of complexity and nuance in their characters.\n\nGeorgiana Tidman's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" is a deliberate attempt to conceal her true identity and create a sense of separation between her past and present selves. As a former jockey, Georgiana has adopted the nickname \"George Tidd\" as a way of maintaining a sense of anonymity and freedom from her past life. However, this nickname also serves as a way of connecting with her past and her sense of self, as she is able to tap into her former identity and experiences through the use of this nickname.\n\nAugustin's role as the Dean is also a form of alternate identity, one that is imposed upon him by his social position and responsibilities. As the Dean, Augustin is expected to embody a sense of authority and gravitas, but this role also serves to conceal his true personality and desires. Through his interactions with Georgiana, it becomes clear that Augustin is struggling with his own sense of identity and purpose, and that his role as the Dean is not a natural fit for him.\n\nThe use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters has a significant impact on the unfolding of their personal and social identities. It creates a sense of tension and conflict between their public and private selves, as they navigate the expectations and demands of their social roles. This tension is particularly evident in Georgiana's character, who is struggling to reconcile her past and present selves, and to find a sense of authenticity and purpose in her life.\n\nThe use of nicknames and alternate identities also serves to highlight the social conventions and expectations that govern the characters' lives. The Dean's role, for example, is a product of social convention and expectation, and Augustin's struggles with this role serve to highlight the artificial nature of social identity. Similarly, Georgiana's use of the nickname \"George Tidd\" serves to underscore the artificial nature of social identity, and the ways in which individuals can create and manipulate their own identities in order to navigate the social world.\n\nUltimately, the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters serves to create a sense of complexity and nuance in their characters, and to highlight the tensions and conflicts that arise from the intersection of personal and social identity. Through their struggles with identity and purpose, the characters are able to navigate the complexities of their social world, and to find a sense of authenticity and purpose in their lives.",
