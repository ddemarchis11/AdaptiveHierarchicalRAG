    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the core connections between Cilicia, Aratus, and Quintilian's criticism, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces additional details about Aratus' work ('Phænomena') and its translations, which are not directly supported by the retrieved context. While these details are relevant, they are not grounded in the provided context, reducing faithfulness. Additionally, the Model Answer misses the explicit mention of Pompey's suppression of piracy in Cilicia, which is a key fact from the Gold Answer, lowering evidence coverage."
