    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies 'Augustin' and 'Gus' as names for THE DEAN, which aligns with the Gold Answer. However, the claim that THE DEAN is referred to as 'John Cox' is unsupported by the retrieved context, where 'John Cox' is mentioned as the author of a book, not as a pseudonym for THE DEAN. This reduces both faithfulness and evidence coverage."
