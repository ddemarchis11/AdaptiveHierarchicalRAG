  "llm_answer": "Papineau's actions during the period leading up to and following the Ninety-Two Resolutions had a significant impact on his relationship with John Neilson. Initially, Neilson was a strong supporter of Papineau, but as Papineau's behavior and views became more domineering and revolutionary, Neilson began to object to certain policies and actions.\n\nSpecifically, Neilson opposed the expulsion of Mondelet from the House, the abolition of the Legislative Council, and Papineau's language during a debate on Quesnel's bill for the independence of judges. These disagreements led to a coolness between the two men, particularly under the governorship of Aylmer.\n\nNeilson's opposition to the Ninety-Two Resolutions was a significant factor in his eventual break with Papineau. He voted against the Resolutions, along with Augustin Cuvillier, F. A. Quesnel, and Andrew Stuart, who also broke away from Papineau's party. This marked a significant shift in Neilson's alignment, as he began to associate with Cuvillier and other moderate politicians who were critical of Papineau's extreme views.\n\nNeilson's break with Papineau was likely influenced by his growing concerns about the radicalism of the _Patriote_ party and the potential consequences of Papineau's actions. As a moderate politician, Neilson may have seen Papineau's behavior as too extreme and divisive, and may have believed that his policies would ultimately harm the interests of the province.\n\nOverall, Papineau's actions during this period led to a significant deterioration in his relationship with John Neilson, who eventually broke away from Papineau's party and aligned himself with more moderate politicians like Augustin Cuvillier.",
