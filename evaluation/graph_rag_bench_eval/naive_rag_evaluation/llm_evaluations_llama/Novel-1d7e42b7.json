    "explanation": "The Model Answer contains the core meaning of the Gold Answer, elaborating on Cousin Cæsar's military service under General Price, his close counsel with Cliff Carlo, and his abandonment by Steve Brindle. However, it introduces unsupported details, such as the 'No. 77' reference and additional reflections by Cousin Cæsar, which are not clearly grounded in the retrieved context. While the Gold Answer's key facts are mentioned, the Model Answer misses the concise focus on these points and adds speculative or tangential information."
