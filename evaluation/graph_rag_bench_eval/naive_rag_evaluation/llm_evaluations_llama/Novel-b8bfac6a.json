  "question": "How did the French Canadians' loyalty to the British crown manifest in times of war?",
  "gold_answer": "French Canadians were loyal to the British crown, which had loyalty from French-Canadian militiamen who fought with English-speaking fellow-countrymen.",
  "llm_answer": "The French Canadians' loyalty to the British crown manifested in times of war in the following ways:\n\n1. During the War of 1812-14, French-Canadian militiamen under French-Canadian officers fought shoulder to shoulder with their English-speaking fellow-countrymen on several stricken fields of battle. They played a crucial role in defending British North America against American invasions.\n\n2. In one engagement, fought at Chateauguay in the French province of Lower Canada, the day was won for British arms by the heroic prowess of Major de Salaberry and his French-Canadian soldiers.\n\n3. The history of the war with the United States provides indelible testimony to the loyalty of French Canada.\n\n4. During the Rebellions of 1837-1838, French-Canadian veterans of the War of 1812 fought against the British, but this was an exception rather than the rule. The majority of French Canadians remained loyal to the British crown.\n\nIt's worth noting that the French Canadians' loyalty to the British crown was not unconditional and was influenced by the British government's conciliatory policy towards them. The British government's recognition of French Canadians' rights, including their language, culture, and religion, helped to maintain their loyalty.",
