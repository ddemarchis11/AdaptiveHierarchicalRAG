  "gold_answer": "Mayab is a country of the Mayas, who are said to have originated from Mayab. Atlantis is the birthplace of Maia, a goddess in Greece.",
  "llm_answer": "The reasoning path that links Mayab to the goddess Maia of Greece is as follows:\n\n1. The author mentions that the name \"Maia\" is found in Greece as a goddess, the mother of the gods, and that she is also the daughter of Atlantis.\n2. The author then notes that the name \"Mayab\" is found in a country beyond the Atlantic Ocean, and that its inhabitants called themselves \"Mayas\".\n3. The author suggests that the name \"Mayab\" is derived from the word \"sieve\" (Mayab) due to the porosity of its soil, and that the inhabitants of this country took their name from it.\n4. The author then notes that the Egyptians used a sign of a sieve to signify a \"Lord\" or \"Master\", and that this sign was used to write the name of Egypt.\n5. The author suggests that this may indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants of the Nile valley were people from Mayab.\n6. The author then notes that the Mayas deified and paid divine honors to their eminent men and women after their death, and that this worship was carried to other countries where they emigrated.\n7. The author suggests that the Mayas may have established this worship among their new inhabitants, who came to forget that Mayab was a locality and converted it into a personality.\n8. The author notes that in Greece, Maia is considered the mother of the gods, and that this may be a remnant of the Mayan tradition of deifying their leaders.\n9. The author concludes that the name \"Maia\" in Greece may be linked to the Mayas of Mayab, and that this may indicate that the Mayas originated from beyond the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn summary, the reasoning path links Mayab to the goddess Maia of Greece through a series of connections:\n\n* Mayab is a country beyond the Atlantic Ocean\n* The name \"Mayab\" is derived from the word \"sieve\"\n* The Egyptians used a sign of a sieve to signify a \"Lord\" or \"Master\"\n* The Mayas deified and paid divine honors to their leaders\n* This worship was carried to other countries where they emigrated\n* The name \"Maia\" in Greece may be a remnant of this Mayan tradition\n* Maia is considered the mother of the gods in Greece, which may be linked to the Mayan tradition of deifying their leaders.",
