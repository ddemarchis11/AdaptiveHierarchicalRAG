    "answer_correctness": 0.5,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.5,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the presence of a _diaulos_ in the British Museum, which is supported by the retrieved context. However, it does not address other items mentioned in the Gold Answer, such as bells, cymbals, a Greek lyre fragment, a tibia, or Anglo-Saxon trumpets. While the answer is faithful to the context, it only partially covers the evidence provided in the Gold Answer."
