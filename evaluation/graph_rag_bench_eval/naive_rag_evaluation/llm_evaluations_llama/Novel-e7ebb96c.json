    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Ruth and Angeline Stickney as sisters and mentions their connection at McGrawville College. However, it misses the specific nuance from the Gold Answer about Ruth wishing to be with Angeline. Additionally, while the retrieved context supports Ruth's attendance at McGrawville and her later financial and emotional support for Angeline, the Model Answer includes details about Angeline's academic excellence and Ruth's health issues that are not explicitly grounded in the provided context. This results in partial correctness and faithfulness, as well as incomplete evidence coverage."
