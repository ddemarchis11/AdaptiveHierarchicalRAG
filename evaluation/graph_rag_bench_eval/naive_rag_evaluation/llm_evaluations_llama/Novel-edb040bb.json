  "llm_answer": "The text does not explicitly mention another name for the Ocellated Pheasant. However, it does mention that some people have asserted that the bird is a peacock, an ordinary Argus of Malacca, or an argus of the race that Elliot named _Argus grayi_, which inhabits Borneo.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to provide the correct alternative name for the Ocellated Pheasant, which is 'Rheinardius ocellatus,' as stated in the Gold Answer and supported by the Retrieved Context. Instead, it discusses unrelated assertions about the bird's identity, which are irrelevant to the question and not grounded in the context."
