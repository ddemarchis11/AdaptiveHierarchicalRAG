  "llm_answer": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, the body processes food for use in growth and energy as follows:\n\n1. **Preparation of food by the stomach**: When we eat, the food goes into the stomach. The stomach works the food over and mixes in gastric juice until it is all a gray fluid. This process prepares the food for transportation to the rest of the body.\n\n2. **Transportation of food by the blood**: The prepared food is then taken into the blood through the intestines, a long, coiled tube that leads out of the stomach. The blood carries the food to the heart, which pumps it out with the blood into the lungs. From there, the blood carries the food to every part of the body, delivering it to the cells where it is needed for growth and energy.\n\nIn essence, the stomach prepares the food by breaking it down into a usable form, and the blood transports this food to the rest of the body, delivering it to the cells where it is needed. This process allows the body to use the food for growth, energy, and repair.",
