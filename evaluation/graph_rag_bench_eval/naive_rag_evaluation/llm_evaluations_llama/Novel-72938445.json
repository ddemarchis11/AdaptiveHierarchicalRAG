    "explanation": "The Model Answer fails to address the question directly and does not provide the correct information that the storage bins hold apples before processing begins. Additionally, the retrieved context does not support the claim about wagon boxes being relevant to storage bins, making the answer unfaithful and lacking evidence coverage."
