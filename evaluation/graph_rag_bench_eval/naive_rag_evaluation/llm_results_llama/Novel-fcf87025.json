  "gold_answer": "Roxie consulted Gov. Morock, Gov. Morock was to pick up the crumbs for Roxie, she was taught the art of penmanship by Ben Robertson, was visited by Aunt Patsy Perkins, and thought of Aunt Patsy.",
  "llm_answer": "Throughout the narrative of 'Pen Pictures,' Roxie has several key relationships with various figures, including:\n\n1. **Governor Morock**: Roxie consults with Governor Morock regarding her legal and financial affairs. He informs her that she is left destitute and penniless, with no appeal possible. However, he offers to help her \"pick up the crumbs\" by securing a large quantity of cotton, which he claims is a valuable commodity. He promises to do this for half the usual price, implying that he can secure two or three hundred bales of cotton worth four hundred dollars each. Roxie agrees to this proposal, seemingly trusting Governor Morock's expertise.\n\n2. **Ben Robertson**: Ben Robertson is Roxie's former teacher, who taught her the art of penmanship during her time in the country school. Roxie is grateful for his instruction and mentally thanks him for his guidance.\n\n3. **Aunt Patsy Perkins**: Roxie has a complex relationship with Aunt Patsy Perkins, who is a wealthy and influential figure in Chicago's upper class. Aunt Patsy is known for her style and her ability to entertain company, but she also has a sharp tongue and is not afraid to speak her mind. Roxie visits Aunt Patsy at her home, where they discuss the possibility of a visit from Cousin Sally, a poor and plain girl from Indiana. Aunt Patsy is dismissive of the idea, stating that she has no love for style and that old Perkins is a \"wooden man\" who is unwilling to change his ways. Roxie also notes that Aunt Patsy is good to Jim, a poor relative, but Aunt Patsy's treatment of her own kin is less charitable.\n\nRoxie's interactions with these figures reveal her to be a resourceful and determined individual who is willing to navigate complex social relationships in order to achieve her goals. Her relationship with Governor Morock is particularly significant, as it highlights her willingness to trust in the expertise of others in order to secure her financial future. However, it also raises questions about the ethics of her decision and the potential consequences of her actions.",

Daymon rich in spite of himself. . The ever wakeful eye of the Angel of observation is peering into the parlor of the Daymon _palace_, to see Roxie surrounded with all the luxuries of furniture, sitting by an ornamented table, upon which lay gilt-edged paper; in the center of the table sat a pearl ink-stand and a glass ornament set with variegated colors. Roxie's forehead rested upon the palm of her left hand, elbow on the table. Profound reflections are passing through her brain; they carry her back to the days of her childhood. Oh, how she loved Suza; the little bright eyes gazed upon her and the red lips pronounced the inaudible sound, “_dear sister_.” “Yes, I will write,” said Roxie, mentally. She takes the gold pen in her right hand, adjusting the paper with her left, she _paused_ to thank from the bottom of her heart old Ben Robertson, who in the country school had taught her the art of penmanship. _Hush!_ did the hall bell ring?

Aunt Patsy Perkins was floating upon the surface of upper-tendom in Chicago. She understood all of the late styles; a queen in the drawing-room, understood the art precisely of entertaining company; the grandest ladies in the city would listen to the council of Aunt Patsy, for she could talk faster and more of it than any woman west of the Alleghany Mountains. The visitor enters the room; Roxie offers Aunt Patsy an easy chair; Aunt Patsy is wiping away the perspiration with a fancy kerchief, in one hand, and using the fan with the other. When seated she said: “I must rest a little, for I have something to tell you, and I will tell you now what it is before I begin. Old Perkins has no more love for style than I have for his _dratted poor kin_. But as I was going to tell you, Perkins received a letter from Indiana, stating this Cousin Sally wished to make us a visit. She's a plain, poor girl, that knows no more of style than Perkins does of a woman's comforts.

Seated in the parlor of one of the descendants of Aunt Patsy Perkins, in Chicago, we see her sad, and alone; we hear the hall bell ring. A servant announces the name of Gov. Morock. “Show the Governor up,” said Roxie, sadly. The ever open ear of the Angel of observation has only furnished us with the following conversation: “Everything is positively lost, madam, not a cent in the world. Every case has gone against us, and no appeal, madam. You are left hopelessly destitute, and penniless. Daymon should have employed me ten years ago--but now, it is too late. Everything is gone, madam,” and the Governor paused. “My mother was once a poor, penniless girl, and I can bear it too,” said Roxie, calmly. “But you see,” said the Governor, softening his voice; “you are a handsome young lady; your fortune is yet to be made. For fifty dollars, madam, I can fix you up a _shadow_, that will marry you off. You see the law has some _loop holes_ and--and in your case, madam, it is no harm to take one; no harm, no harm, madam,” and the",

What wealthy families are to do in this city, God only knows. I think sometimes old Perkins is a _wooden man_, for, with all my style, I can make no more impression on h-i-m, than I can upon an oak stump, Mrs. Daymon. What if he did make a thousand dollars last week, when he wants to stick his _poor kin_ 'round me, like stumps in a flower garden.” At this point Roxie ventured to say a word. “Aunt Patsy, I thought Jim was kinsfolk on your side of the house.” “Yes, but honey, I am good to Jim, poor soul, he knows it,” said Aunt Patsy gravely, and then she paused.

Some arrangement ought to be made, and I think I could do it through some officer of the federal army,” said the Governor, rubbing his hand across his forehead, and continued, “that's what I mean by picking up the crumbs, madam.” “_How much?_” said Roxie, preparing to leave the office. “I m always liberal, madam, always liberal. Let me see; it is attended with some difficulty; can't leave the city; too much business pressing (rubbing his hands); well--well--I will pick up the crumbs for half. Think I can secure two or three hundred bales of cotton, madam,” said the Governor, confidentially. “How much is a bale of cotton worth?” said Roxie, affecting ignorance. “Only four hundred dollars, madam; nothing but a crumb--nothing but a crumb, madam,” said the Governor, in a tone of flattery. “Do the best you can,” said Roxie, in a confidential tone, as she left the office. Governor Morock was enjoying the reputation of the fashionable lawyer among the upper-ten in Chicago. Roxie Daymon's good sense condemned him, but she did not feel at liberty to break the line of association.
