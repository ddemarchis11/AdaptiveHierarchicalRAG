Aunt Ruth has trouble enough, says she has been over to Elmina’s, and David does not get up till breakfast time leaving E. to do all the chores I suppose. She writes that Leffert Eastman’s wife is dead, and their neighbor Mr. Adnah Carley. Now I must close my diary or I shall not get it into the office to-night. I am putting down carpets and am very busy With love C. A. S. HALL. [WASHINGTON] Nov. 12th ’88 MY DEAR ANGELO AND PERCIVAL [at college], ... Sam. is reading Goethe’s Faust aloud to me when I can sit down to sew, and perhaps I told you that he is helping me to get things together for my Prometheus Unbound. He is translating now Aeschylos’ fragments for I wish to know as far as possible how Aeschylos treated the subject. I have a plan all my own which I think a good one, and have made a beginning. I know I shall have to work hard if I write any thing good, but am willing to work. You must write often. Father and Sam. and I went to Mr. Kings to tea last evening. On the next day after Thanksgiving our Historical Society begins its work. With love C. A. S. HALL. CLINTON, N.Y. Sept. 8th, 1890",

It is well to keep the teaching of the Prometheus Bound in mind, that merely material civilization is not enough; and must not stand alone. But the knowledge that we get from all science, that effects follow causes always, will teach perhaps just as effectively as other preaching. This makes me think of the pleasant time Sam and I had when he was home last, reading George Eliot’s Romola. This work is really a great drama, and I am much impressed with the power of it. I would say _Philosophy_ AND Science now and forever one and inseparable.... With much love C. A. S. HALL. WASHINGTON D.C. June 10th ’92 MY DEAR PERCIVAL [at college], Your father has just got home from Madison. He says you can go to see the boat-race if you wish to. A. Jr. says perhaps he will go, when are the tickets to be sold, he says, on the train that follows the race? He thinks perhaps he would like two tickets. Now about your furniture. When Sam was home we talked it over. He thought you had better sell to the Fays the bureau, bedstead, chairs, etc. and that you send home the revolving bookcase, the desk and hair mattress; and such of the bedclothes as",

I had friends in Pumpiter and occasionally paid a long visit there.

Well, in the scene painted on the walls of Chaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is represented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the extraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife, his sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children. I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the preceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of reckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs under the form of a baboon (cynocephalus). He is one of the most ancient divinities among the Egyptians. He had also the office of scribe in the lower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the dead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris. One of the modes of writing his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters, reads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes, since, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand, to perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to scatter flowers; hence knowledge.

I am sorry the Boston girl is getting to be so helpless. I think all who have to keep some one to take care of them had better leave for Europe on the first steamer. I think co-education would be a great help to both boys and girls. I have never liked schools for girls alone since Harriette Lewis and Antoinette McLain went to Pittsfield to the Young Ladies Institute. I have just been reading Mrs. Stanton’s advice to her sons, “When you marry do choose a woman with a spine and sound teeth.” Now I think a woman needs two kinds of good back-bone. As for Astronomical work, and all kinds of scientific work, there may not be the pressing need there was for it a few centuries ago; but I think our modern theory of progress is nearly right as described by Taine, “as that which founds all our aspirations on the boundless advance of the sciences, on the increase of comforts which their applied discoveries constantly bring to the human condition, and on the increase of good sense which their discoveries, popularized, slowly deposit in the human brain.” Of course Ethical teaching must keep pace.
