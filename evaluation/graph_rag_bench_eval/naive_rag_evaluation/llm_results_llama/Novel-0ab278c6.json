  "question": "What circumstances in Miss Euphemia Trotter's early life, as described in the novel, led her to become a teacher at an Eastern seminary, considering her background as a poor girl educated at the same institution?",
  "gold_answer": "Miss Euphemia Trotter was really a poor girl who had been educated in an Eastern seminary and later became a teacher there.",
  "llm_answer": "The novel does not explicitly state the circumstances that led Miss Euphemia Trotter to become a teacher at an Eastern seminary. However, it can be inferred that her background as a poor girl who had to work hard for her living since she was 14 years old likely played a significant role in her decision to pursue a career in teaching.\n\nIt is mentioned that Miss Trotter had survived her parents and a neglected childhood, and had worked in various roles such as a nurse in a hospital, an assistant in a reformatory, and had observed men and women under conditions of pain and weakness. This suggests that she may have had a strong desire to help others and make a positive impact on their lives.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that she was educated at an Eastern seminary, where she eventually became a teacher, implies that she may have been motivated by a sense of duty and a desire to give back to her community. It is likely that her experiences in her early life, including her poverty and her work in various roles, led her to develop a strong sense of empathy and a desire to help others, which ultimately led her to become a teacher.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the novel suggests that Miss Trotter's hard philosophy and her ability to bring out the best in people, even in difficult circumstances, may have been shaped by her early life experiences. Her decision to become a teacher may have been a way for her to use her experiences and skills to make a positive impact on the lives of others.",

It gave rise to surmises more or less ingenious and conflicting: Miss Trotter had a secret interest in the hotel, and represented a San Francisco syndicate; Miss Trotter was a woman of independent property, and had advanced large sums to Bilson; Miss Trotter was a woman of no property, but she was the only daughter of--variously--a late distinguished nobleman, a ruined millionaire, and a foreign statesman, bent on making her own living. Alas, for romance! Miss Euphemia Trotter, or \"Miss E. Trotter,\" as she preferred to sign herself, loathing her sentimental prefix, was really a poor girl who had been educated in an Eastern seminary, where she eventually became a teacher. She had survived her parents and a neglected childhood, and had worked hard for her living since she was fourteen. She had been a nurse in a hospital, an assistant in a reformatory, had observed men and women under conditions of pain and weakness, and had known the body only as a tabernacle of helplessness and suffering; yet had brought out of her experience a hard philosophy which she used equally",

      "text": "TEACHING SCHOOL. In the North teaching follows schooling almost as a matter of course. In 1848 Angeline Stickney began to teach the district school in Heath Hollow, near Rodman, for a dollar and a quarter a week and board. The same year she taught also at Pleasant Valley, near Cape Vincent, whither Edwin Ingalls had moved. Angeline boarded with her sister and spun her wool. Would that some artist had painted this nineteenth century Priscilla at the spinning-wheel! For the next nine years, that is, until a year after her marriage, she was alternately teacher and pupil. In the winter of 1849-50 she tutored in the family of Elder Bright, who six years later, in Wisconsin, performed her marriage ceremony. In the winter of 1850-51 she attended the seminary at Rodman, together with her sister Ruth. An excellent teacher always, she won the respect and affection of her pupils. After her death a sturdy farmer of Rodman told me, with great feeling, how much he liked the patient teacher. He was a dull boy, and found many perplexities in arithmetic, which Miss Stickney carefully explained. And so she became the boy’s ideal woman. Very seldom did she have to resort to punishment, but when punishment was necessary she did not flinch. The same might be said of her in the rearing of her four sons. Her gentleness, united to a resolute will and thorough",

If you would talk to her as sensibly as you have to me\"-- \"It is not likely that she will seek my assistance as you have,\" said Miss Trotter, with a faint smile which Mr. Calton thought quite pretty, \"but I will see about it.\" Whatever Miss Trotter intended to do did not transpire. She certainly was in no hurry about it, as she did not say anything to Frida that day, and the next afternoon it so chanced that business took her to the bank and post-office. Her way home again lay through the Summit woods. It recalled to her the memorable occasion when she was first a witness to Frida's flirtations. Neither that nor Mr. Bilson's presumed gallantries, however, seemed inconsistent, in Miss Trotter's knowledge of the world, with a serious engagement with young Calton. She was neither shocked nor horrified by it, and for that reason she had not thought it necessary to speak of it to the elder Mr. Calton. Her path wound through a thicket fragrant with syringa and southernwood; the faint perfume was reminiscent of Atlantic hillsides, where, long ago, a girl teacher, she had walked with the girl pupils of the Vermont academy, and kept them from the shy advances of the local swains. She smiled--a little sadly--as the thought occurred to her that after this interval of",

Dr. Elsie’s power of sympathy and understanding was as much called upon in her paying practice as among the very poor. She made no distinction in what she gave; her friendship was as ready as her trained skill. There was one patient whose sufferings were largely due to her own lack of will power. Elsie, after prescribing, bent down and kissed her. It awoke in the individual the sense that she was not ‘altogether bad,’ and from that day forward there was a newness of life. From what sources of inner strength did she increasingly minister in that sphere in which she moved? ‘Thy touch has still its ancient power,’ and no one who knew this unresting, unhasting, well-balanced life, but felt it had drawn its spiritual strength from the deep wells of Salvation. In these years the kindred points of heaven and home were always in the background of her life. Her sisters’ homes were near her in Edinburgh, and when her brother Ernest died in India, in 1910, his widow and her three daughters came back to her house. Her friendship and understanding of all the large circle that called her aunt was a very beautiful tie. The elder ones were near enough to her own age to be companions to her from her girlhood. Miss Simson says that she was more like an elder",

She gently withdrew her hand as if to continue her walk, and said, with a smile:-- \"Then you confess you need help--in what way?\" \"With her!\" Miss Trotter stared. \"With HER!\" she repeated. This was a new idea. Was it possible that this common, ignorant girl was playing and trifling with her golden opportunity? \"Then you are not quite sure of her?\" she said a little coldly. \"She's so high spirited, you know,\" he said humbly, \"and so attractive, and if she thought my friends objected and were saying unkind things of her,--well!\"--he threw out his hands with a suggestion of hopeless despair--\"there's no knowing what she might do.\" Miss Trotter's obvious thought was that Frida knew on which side her bread was buttered; but remembering that the proprietor was a widower, it occurred to her that the young woman might also have it buttered on both sides. Her momentary fancy of uniting two lovers somehow weakened at this suggestion, and there was a hardening of her face as she said, \"Well, if YOU can't trust her, perhaps your brother may be right.\" \"I don't say that, Miss Trotter,\" said Chris pleadingly, yet with a slight",
