  "gold_answer": "Rubber boots can cause the pores on your feet to become clogged.",
  "llm_answer": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, wearing rubber boots indoors can cause the pores on your feet to become clogged because rubber prevents the perspiration from passing off. Perspiration is the waste matter and water that comes out through the tiny holes in the skin, called pores, and is carried off by tiny tubes. When rubber boots are worn indoors, the rubber prevents the perspiration from escaping, causing the pores to become clogged.\n\nThis can lead to discomfort and health issues. The clogged pores can cause the feet to feel uncomfortable, and in severe cases, it can lead to other problems. Additionally, if the pores become clogged, it can also cause the head to ache, indicating that the body is experiencing stress due to the blocked pores.\n\nIt's worth noting that the primer advises wearing rubber boots outdoors when the ground is wet, as they are useful in such situations. However, it's essential to remove them as soon as you come indoors to prevent the pores from becoming clogged.",

The finger nails are little shields to protect the ends of your fingers from getting hurt. These finger ends are full of tiny nerves, and would be badly off without such shields. No one likes to see nails that have been bitten. CARE OF THE SKIN. Waste matter is all the time passing out through the perspiration tubes in the skin. This waste matter must not be left to clog up the little openings of the tubes. It should be washed off with soap and water. When children have been playing out-of-doors, they often have very dirty hands and faces. Any one can see, then, that they need to be washed. But even if they had been in the cleanest place all day and had not touched any thing dirty, they would still need the washing; for the waste matter that comes from the inside of the body is just as hurtful as the mud or dust of the street. You do not see it so plainly, because it comes out very little at a time. Wash it off well, and your skin will be fresh and healthy, and able to do its work. If the skin could not do its work, you would die. Do not keep on your rubber boots or shoes all through school-time.

No part can fail to do its work without causing trouble to the rest of the body. But you should always wear rubbers out-of-doors when the ground is wet. Certainly, they are very useful then. When you are out in the fresh air, you are giving the other parts of your body such a good chance to perspire, that your feet can bear a little shutting up. But as soon as you come into the house, take the rubbers off. Now that you know what the skin is doing all the time, you will understand that the clothes worn next to your skin are full of little worn-out particles, brought out by the perspiration. When these clothes are taken off at night, they should be so spread out, that they will air well before morning. Never wear any of the clothes through the night, that you have worn during the day. Do not roll up your night-dress in the morning and put it under your pillow. Give it first a good airing at the window and then hang it where the air can reach it all day. By so doing, you will have sweeter sleep at night. You are old enough to throw the bed-clothes off from the bed, before leaving your rooms in the morning. In this way, the bed and",

A great deal of heat from your warm body is all the time passing off through your skin, into the cooler air about you. For this reason, a room full of people is much warmer than the same room when empty. CLOTHING. We put on clothes to keep in the heat which we already have, and to prevent the cold air from reaching our skins and carrying off too much heat in that way. Most of you children are too young to choose what clothes you will wear. Others decide for you. You know, however, that woolen under-garments keep you warm in winter, and that thick boots and stockings should be worn in cold weather. Thin dresses or boots may look pretty; but they are not safe for winter wear, even at a party. A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes which are suitable for the season, is pleasanter to look at than one whose dress, though rich and handsome, is not warm enough for health or comfort. When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible. This will make the hot blood flow all through your body and warm it.

Because under the outside skin is the true skin, which is so full of little nerves that it will feel the least touch as pain. When the outer skin, which protects it, is torn away, we must cover the true skin to keep it from harm. In hot weather, or when any one has been working or playing hard, the face, and sometimes the whole body, is covered with little drops of water. We call these drops perspiration (p[~e]r sp[)i] r[=a]'sh[)u]n). [Illustration: _Perspiratory tube._] Where does it come from? It comes through many tiny holes in the skin, called pores (p[=o]rz). Every pore is the mouth of a tiny tube which is carrying off waste matter and water from your body. If you could piece together all these little perspiration tubes that are in the skin of one person, they would make a line more than three miles long. Sometimes, you can not see the perspiration, because there is not enough of it to form drops. But it is always coming out through your skin, both in winter and summer.
