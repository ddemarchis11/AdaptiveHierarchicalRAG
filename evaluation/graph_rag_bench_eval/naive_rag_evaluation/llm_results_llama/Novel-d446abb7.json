  "question": "Imagine you are the Duke of Wellington. Write a diary entry about your efforts to emancipate the Catholics and your thoughts on the Irish and English relations.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today I continued my advocacy for Catholic emancipation. I am aware that the Catholics of this era know the necessity of modesty, especially considering their Irish heritage. There is a sentiment in high places that the Irish have been too lenient toward the English, and yet, England itself is a nation with a sense of common descent and unity. My hope is that these reforms will foster greater harmony across all these groups.",
  "llm_answer": "February 10, 1829\n\nI can hardly believe the tumult that has been stirred up by my efforts to emancipate the Catholics. It seems that my well-intentioned actions have been met with resistance from many quarters. The English people, whom I have always considered to be a fair and just nation, have risen up in opposition to my proposal.\n\nI must confess that I have always believed that the Catholics of Ireland have been treated unfairly. Their rights and freedoms have been curtailed for far too long, and I have sought to rectify this situation through the Catholic Emancipation Act. But, alas, it seems that my efforts have been for naught.\n\nThe Irish, whom I have always considered to be a proud and passionate people, have been vocal in their support of my proposal. But, I fear that their enthusiasm has been matched by the opposition of the English people. The Tory party, in particular, has been vehement in its opposition to my plan, and I fear that their influence may yet prevail.\n\nI am deeply troubled by the state of relations between the English and the Irish. It seems that the English have long viewed the Irish as inferior, and that this prejudice has been perpetuated for far too long. I have always believed that the Irish are a worthy and deserving people, and that they should be treated as such.\n\nBut, I fear that my efforts to emancipate the Catholics may have been in vain. The opposition to my proposal is too great, and I fear that it may yet be defeated. I can only hope that, in the end, justice will prevail, and that the Catholics of Ireland will be granted the rights and freedoms that they so rightly deserve.\n\nI am also troubled by the fact that my own reputation may be tarnished by this controversy. I have always sought to act with integrity and honor, and I fear that my efforts to emancipate the Catholics may be seen as a betrayal of my own people.\n\nBut, I must press on, despite the opposition. I am convinced that my actions are just and right, and I will not be swayed by the opinions of others. I will continue to fight for the rights and freedoms of the Catholics of Ireland, even if it means going against the will of the English people.\n\nI can only hope that, in the end, my efforts will be vindicated, and that the Catholics of Ireland will be granted the freedom and equality that they so rightly deserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Duke of Wellington",

I gathered that our national troubles in the first two decades of this century were not at all due to the mistakes of our administrators; and that England, with its fine Church and Constitution, would have been exceedingly well off if every British subject had been thankful for what was provided, and had minded his own business--if, for example, numerous Catholics of that period had been aware how very modest they ought to be considering they were Irish. The times, I heard, had often been bad; but I was constantly hearing of \"bad times\" as a name for actual evenings and mornings when the godfathers who gave them that name appeared to me remarkably comfortable. Altogether, my father's England seemed to me lovable, laudable, full of good men, and having good rulers, from Mr Pitt on to the Duke of Wellington, until he was for emancipating the Catholics; and it was so far from prosaic to me that I looked into it for a more exciting romance than such as I could find in my own adventures, which consisted mainly in fancied crises calling for the resolute wielding of domestic swords and firearms against unapparent robbers, rioters, and invaders who, it seemed, in my father's prime had more chance of being real.

About the middle of December she had reached Elkhorn, Wisconsin, where she remained a fortnight with Elder Bright, her old pastor. Then she went to her sister Charlotte’s, at Milford. In one of her letters from this place she speaks of going surveying. It seems the surveyor of the neighborhood was surprised to find a woman who understood his business. In the latter part of December, Asaph Hall returned to Goshen, Conn. Hence the following letter: GOSHEN, Jan. 17th, 1856. DEAREST ANGIE: ...

So, I thought, “Well, I won’t obtrude mine.” Then Mrs. D. said, “You must take a side, you know, and say distinctly what side you are on when you are asked.” So I thought, “Well, I’ll wait till I am asked,” and I have got through to-day without being asked. But, positively, they used the word “boycott” about those D.’s. They have been boycotted by the congregation. It must be rather hard to be a Home Ruler and a Presbyterian just now in Ireland. Positively, they frightened me so, I nearly squirmed under the table. However, when I looked round the congregation I thought I should not mind much being boycotted by them.
