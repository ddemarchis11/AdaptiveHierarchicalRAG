  "question": "When Raegen is fleeing the police after a violent encounter, where does he wish to hide in order to avoid being caught, and why does he consider these locations safe?",
  "gold_answer": "Raegen wanted to lie hidden in his own cellar and his own garret.",
  "llm_answer": "Unfortunately, the provided text does not mention Raegen's specific plans for hiding after fleeing the police. However, it does mention that three different men in the precinct reported him as lost and thought he had been drowned in the river. This implies that Raegen has a history of using the river as a means of escape, and that he is familiar with the area and its surroundings.\n\nIt can be inferred that Raegen might consider the river a safe place to hide, as he has successfully used it as an escape route in the past. However, on this particular occasion, the police are standing between him and the river, cutting off his escape in that direction.",

When a sick or wounded man is brought into the hospital, one of the first questions asked him by the doctor is: \"Do you drink?\" If he answers \"Yes!\" the next questions are, \"What do you drink?\" and \"How much?\" The answers he gives to these questions, show the doctor what chance the man has of getting well. A man who never drinks liquor will get well, where a drinking man would surely die. TOBACCO AND THE NERVES. Why does any one wish to use tobacco? Because many men say that it helps them, and makes them feel better. Shall I tell you how it makes them feel better? If a man is cold, the tobacco deadens his nerves so that he does not feel the cold and does not take pains to make himself warmer. If a man is tired, or in trouble, tobacco will not really rest him or help him out of his trouble. It only puts his nerves to sleep and helps him think that he is not tired, and that he does not need to overcome his troubles. It puts his nerves to sleep very much as alcohol does, and helps him to be contented with what ought not to content him. A boy who smokes or chews tobacco, is not so good a scholar as if he did not use the poison. He can not remember his lessons so well. Usually, too, he is not so polite, nor so good a boy",

The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku lar) walls. Every time we breathe, these walls have to move. The muscles of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you breathe. All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is directed by the nerves. You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so you are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs. Is alcohol a help to them? REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1.

Indeed, three different men in the precinct, who did not know of young Raegen's aquatic prowess, had returned to the station-house and seriously reported him to the sergeant as lost, and regretted having driven a citizen into the river, where he had been unfortunately drowned. It was even told how, on one occasion, when hotly followed, young Raegen had dived off Wakeman's Slip, at East Thirty-third Street, and had then swum back under water to the landing-steps, while the policeman and a crowd of stevedores stood watching for him to reappear where he had sunk. It is further related that he had then, in a spirit of recklessness, and in the possibility of the policeman's failing to recognize him, pushed his way through the crowd from the rear and plunged in to rescue the supposedly drowned man. And that after two or three futile attempts to find his own corpse, he had climbed up on the dock and told the officer that he had touched the body sticking in the mud. And, as a result of this fiction, the river-police dragged the river-bed around Wakeman's Slip with grappling irons for four hours, while Rags sat on the wharf and directed their movements. But on this present occasion the police were standing between him and the river, and so cut off his escape in that direction, and as they had seen him strike McGonegal",
