  "gold_answer": "As the only son of S. S. Simon, I often hear stories about our family. My cousin, Cæsar, has been at the center of recent events, from delivering a note to the Governor to helping Simon learn about Roxie's family. I hear Roxie has been charged, and I worry for her. Our family feels so interconnected, especially with big-sis raising Cæsar and our ties to the Carlow and Brindle families.",
  "llm_answer": "April 6, 1861\n\nI can barely muster the strength to write these words, but I must confess my thoughts and feelings to this diary. My life has been a whirlwind of excitement and adventure, but now, as I lay here in this hotel room, I am faced with the harsh reality of my mortality.\n\nI have always known that I come from a humble background, with no family history to speak of. My mother, Nancy Wade, and my father, Cæsar Simon, are both gone, and I was raised by my sisters. I've tried to make a name for myself, but it seems that my fate was sealed from the beginning.\n\nCousin Cæsar, who has been by my side throughout this journey, has revealed to me a shocking truth. I am the heir to a vast estate in Arkansas, left behind by my uncle, S.S. Simon. But it seems that I am not the only one with a claim to this inheritance. Roxie Daymon, the young woman I fell in love with, has been revealed to be the beneficiary of my will, which I dictated just hours before my passing.\n\nI must admit, I am torn by conflicting emotions. On one hand, I am grateful to Roxie for her kindness and devotion to me during my final days. She has been a beacon of hope and comfort in my darkest hour. But on the other hand, I am troubled by the thought of leaving behind a vast fortune to someone I barely knew. It seems unfair, and I fear that Cæsar may be right in his suspicions that Roxie may not be what she seems.\n\nAs I look back on my life, I am filled with a sense of regret and longing. I had hoped to build a life with Roxie, to start a family and create a legacy of my own. But now, it seems that my fate has been sealed, and I am left with only these final thoughts and feelings to guide me.\n\nI can only hope that Cæsar will see justice done, and that the truth about Roxie's intentions will be revealed. Until then, I can only rest in peace, knowing that my story will live on, and that the secrets of my family's past will be uncovered in time.\n\nFarewell, dear diary. May the truth be revealed, and may justice be served.",

Cousin Cæsar now told young Simon the whole story. Twenty-thousand dollars, with twenty years interest, was against his estate. Roxie Daymon, the young lady on the boat, was an heir, others lived in Kentucky--all of which cousin Cæsar learned from a descendant of Brindle Bill.

Young Simon and cousin Cæsar left for the West Indies.--Young Simon and Roxie Daymon were engaged to be married the following spring at Chicago. Simon saw many beautiful women in his travels--but the image of Roxie Daymon was ever before him. The good Angel of observation has failed to inform us, of Roxie Daymon's feelings and object in the match. A young and beautiful woman; full of life and vigor consenting to wed a dying man, _hushed_ the voice of the good Angel, and he has said nothing. Spring with its softening breezes returned--the ever to be remembered spring of 1861. The shrill note of the iron horse announced the arrival of young Simon and cousin Cæsar in Chicago, on the 7th day of April, 1861. Simon had lived upon excitement, and reaching the destination of his hopes--the great source of his life failed--cousin Cæsar carried him into the hotel--he never stood alone again--the marriage was put off--until Simon should be better. On the second day, cousin Cæsar was preparing to leave the room, on business in a distant part of the city. Roxie had been several times alone with Simon, and was then present. Roxie handed a sealed note to cousin Cæsar, politely asking him to deliver it. The note was inscribed, Gov. Morock, No.",

Cousin Cæsar had been absent but a short time, when that limb of the law appeared and wrote a will dictated by young Simon; bequeathing all of his possessions, without reserve to Roxie Daymon. “How much,” said Roxie, as the Governor was about to leave. “Only ten dollars, madam,” said the Governor, as he stuffed the bill carelessly in his vest pocket and departed. Through the long vigils of the night cousin Cæsar sat by the side of the dying man; before the sun had silvered the eastern horizon, the soul of young Simon was with his fathers. The day was consumed in making preparations for the last, honor due the dead. Cousin Cæsar arranged with a party to take the remains to Arkansas, and place the son by the side of the father, on the home plantation. The next morning as cousin Cæsar was scanning the morning papers, the following brief notice attracted his attention: “Young Simon, the wealthy young cotton planter, who died in the city yesterday, left by his last will and testament his whole estate, worth more than a million of dollars, to Roxie Daymon, a young lady of this city.” Cousin Cæsar was bewildered and astonished.

My father's name was Cæsar Simon, and I bear his name. My mother's name was Nancy Wade. I do not remember either of them I was partly raised by my sisters, and the balance of the time I have tried to raise myself, but it seems it will take me a Iong time to _make a raise_--” at this point, Brindle interfered in breathless suspense, with the inquiry, “Did you have an uncle named S. S. Simon?” “I have heard my sister say as much,” continued Simon. “Then your dream is interpreted,” said Brindle, emphatically. “Your Uncle, S. S. Simon, has left one of the largest estates in Arkansas, and now you are on the steam wagon again,” said Brindle, slapping his companion on the shoulder. Brindle had been instructed by his mother, and made Cousin Cæsar acquainted with the outline of all the history detailed in this narrative, except the history of Roxie Daymon _alias_ Roxie Fairfield, in Chicago. The next day the two men were hired as hands to go down the river on a flat-bottom boat. Roxie Daymon, whose death has been recorded, left an only daughter, now grown to womanhood, and bearing her",

More than this, your orator has nothing to say of the war, except its effect upon the characters we describe. The bright blossoms of a May morning were opening to meet the sunlight, while the surrounding foliage was waving in the soft breeze ol spring; on the southern bank of the beautiful Ohio, where the momentous events of the future were concealed from the eyes of the preceding generation by the dar veil of the coming revolutions of the globe. We see Cousin Cæsar and Cliff Carlo in close counsel, upon the subject of meeting the expenses of the contest at law over the Simon estate, in the State of Arkansas. Cliff Carlo was rather non-committal. Roxie Daymon was a near relative, and the unsolved problem in the case of compromise and law did not admit of haste on the part of the Carlo family. Compromise was not the forte of Cousin Cæsar, To use his own words, “I have made the cast, and will stand the hazard of the die.” But the enterprise, with surrounding circumstances, would have baffled a bolder man than Cæsar Simon.
