  "question": "In what way was the city of Hamburg involved in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, especially through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'?",
  "gold_answer": "Hamburg was involved through the Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent, which reviewed Tristram Shandy and was edited by Bode.",
  "llm_answer": "The city of Hamburg played a significant role in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, particularly through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'.\n\nBode, a resident of Hamburg, was exceptionally proficient in English and was the editor of the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' from 1763 to 1770. In 1763, he published a review of 'Tristram Shandy' in the journal, which is considered to be one of the earliest reviews of the novel in Germany. This review is significant because it suggests that Bode was already familiar with Sterne's work and was promoting it to his readers.\n\nThe 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' was a prominent journal in Hamburg, and its review of 'Tristram Shandy' helped to introduce the novel to a wider audience in Germany. The journal's review was likely influential in shaping public opinion about Sterne's work and contributed to its growing popularity in Germany.\n\nBode's own translation of 'Tristram Shandy' was published in 1774, and it is considered to be one of the most important translations of the novel in Germany. Bode's translation was widely read and admired, and it helped to establish Sterne as a major literary figure in Germany.\n\nThe city of Hamburg also played a role in the reception of Sterne's works through the activities of other writers and intellectuals who were associated with the city. For example, the writer and critic, Johann Joachim Eschenburg, was a resident of Hamburg and was known for his enthusiasm for Sterne's work. Eschenburg's writings on Sterne helped to promote the novelist's reputation in Germany and contributed to the growing interest in his work.\n\nOverall, the city of Hamburg played a significant role in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, particularly through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'. The city's writers and intellectuals helped to promote Sterne's work and contributed to its growing popularity in Germany.",

      "text": "is not to be located with certainty, yet it may well have been Bode, the later apostle of Sterne-worship in Germany. Bode was a resident of Hamburg at this time, was exceptionally proficient in English and, according to Jördens[13] and Schröder,[14] he was in 1762-3 the editor of the _Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_. The precise date when Bode severed his connection with the paper is indeterminate, yet this, the second number of the new year 1764, may have come under his supervision even if his official connection ended exactly with the close of the old year. To be sure, when Bode ten years later published his own version of Shandy, he translated, with the exception of two rather insignificant cases, none of the passages verbally the same as the reviewer in this journal, but it would be unreasonable to attach any great weight to this fact. Eight or nine years later, when undertaking the monumental task of rendering the whole of Shandy into German, it is not likely that Bode would recall the old translations he had made in this review or concern himself about them. A brief comparison of the two sets of translations suggests that the critic was striving merely for accuracy in correcting the errors of Zückert, and that Bode in his formal translation shows a riper and more certain feeling for the choice of words; the effect of purposeful reflection is",

      "text": "Bode’s translation of the Sentimental Journey contains, further, a sketch of Sterne’s life,[26] his character and his works. Bode relates the familiar story of the dog, but misses the point entirely in rendering “puppy” by “Geck” in Sterne’s reply, “So lang er ein Geck ist.” The watchcoat episode is narrated, and a brief account is given of Sterne’s fortunes in London with Tristram Shandy and the sermons. Allusion has already been made to the hints thrown out in this sketch relative to the reading of Sterne in Germany. A translation from Shandy of the passage descriptive of Parson Yorick serves as a portrait for Sterne. A second edition of Bode’s work was published in 1769. The preface, which is dated “Anfang des Monats Mai, 1769,” is in the main identical with the first, but has some significant additions. A word is said relative to his controversy with a critic, which is mentioned later.[27] Bode confesses further that the excellence of his work is due to Ebert and Lessing,[28] though modesty compelled his silence in the previous preface concerning the source of his aid. Bode admits that even this disclosure is prompted by the clever guess of a critic in the _Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_,[29] who openly named Lessing as",

A reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[10] in an account of Bode’s and Wichmann’s renderings of “Tom Jones,” begs Bode to fulfill the hopes thus raised, saying he could give Yorick’s friends no more valuable or treasured gift. Böttiger in his biographical sketch of Bode expressed regret that the work never saw the light, adding that the work contained so many allusions to contemporary celebrities and hits upon Bode’s acquaintance that wisdom had consigned to oblivion.[11] A correspondent, writing to the _Teutscher Merkur_,[12] minimizes the importance of this so-called commentary, saying “er hatte nie einen Kommentar der Art, . . . auch nur angefangen auszuarbeiten. Die ganze Sache gründet sich auf eine scherzhafte Aeusserung gegen seinem damaligen Freund in Hamburg, welchen er oft mit der ihm eignen Ironie mit diesem Kommentar zu drohen pflegte.” The list of subscribers to Bode’s translation contained upwards of 650 names, among which are Boie, Claudius, Einsieder, Gerstenberg, Gleim, Fräulein",
