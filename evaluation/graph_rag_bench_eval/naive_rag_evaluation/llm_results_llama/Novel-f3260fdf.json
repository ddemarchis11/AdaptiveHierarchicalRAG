  "question": "Describe the reasoning path that links Mayab to the goddess Maia of Greece.",
  "gold_answer": "Mayab is a country of the Mayas, who are said to have originated from Mayab. Atlantis is the birthplace of Maia, a goddess in Greece.",
  "llm_answer": "The reasoning path that links Mayab to the goddess Maia of Greece is as follows:\n\n1. The author mentions that the name \"Maia\" is found in Greece as a goddess, the mother of the gods, and that she is also the daughter of Atlantis.\n2. The author then notes that the name \"Mayab\" is found in a country beyond the Atlantic Ocean, and that its inhabitants called themselves \"Mayas\".\n3. The author suggests that the name \"Mayab\" is derived from the word \"sieve\" (Mayab) due to the porosity of its soil, and that the inhabitants of this country took their name from it.\n4. The author then notes that the Egyptians used a sign of a sieve to signify a \"Lord\" or \"Master\", and that this sign was used to write the name of Egypt.\n5. The author suggests that this may indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants of the Nile valley were people from Mayab.\n6. The author then notes that the Mayas deified and paid divine honors to their eminent men and women after their death, and that this worship was carried to other countries where they emigrated.\n7. The author suggests that the Mayas may have established this worship among their new inhabitants, who came to forget that Mayab was a locality and converted it into a personality.\n8. The author notes that in Greece, Maia is considered the mother of the gods, and that this may be a remnant of the Mayan tradition of deifying their leaders.\n9. The author concludes that the name \"Maia\" in Greece may be linked to the Mayas of Mayab, and that this may indicate that the Mayas originated from beyond the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn summary, the reasoning path links Mayab to the goddess Maia of Greece through a series of connections:\n\n* Mayab is a country beyond the Atlantic Ocean\n* The name \"Mayab\" is derived from the word \"sieve\"\n* The Egyptians used a sign of a sieve to signify a \"Lord\" or \"Master\"\n* The Mayas deified and paid divine honors to their leaders\n* This worship was carried to other countries where they emigrated\n* The name \"Maia\" in Greece may be a remnant of this Mayan tradition\n* Maia is considered the mother of the gods in Greece, which may be linked to the Mayan tradition of deifying their leaders.",

      "text": "goddess MAIA was the daughter of _Atlantis_. We have seen that the names of the khati, those of their cities, that of Tyre, and finally that of Egypt, have their etymology in the Maya. Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more I could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas and the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned men of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of their ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had emigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the Chinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the rising sun, establish themselves in America. In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of CAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests in the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its details. It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their sister ISIS. Some of the names only have been changed when the members of the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching apotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped. That the story of _Isis_ and _Osiris_ is a mythical account of CHAACMOL and MOO, from all the",

They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established himself there. We do not find the etymology of his name in any book where mention is made of it. We are merely told that he was a wise magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura (demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men. Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are words belonging to the American Maya language. Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst the Chaldees. We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man. If we come to Greece, where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis. But if we come to the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of",

If identical customs and manners, and the worship of the same divinities under the same name, besides the traditions of a people pointing towards a certain point of the globe as being the birth-place of their ancestors, prove anything, then I must say that in Egypt also we meet with the tracks of the Mayas, of whose name we again have a reminiscence in that of the goddess Maia, the daughter of Atlantis, worshiped in Greece.

Its inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called themselves _Mayas_. It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a _Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve. Would not this seem to indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land, were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with the sign of land? We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent men and women after their death. This worship of their heroes they undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and Greece. It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization from the inhabitants of the",

We are told that Maya is born from Atlantis; in other words, that the Mayas came from beyond the Atlantic waters. Here, also, we find that Maia is called the mother of the gods _Kubeles_. _Ku_, Maya _God_, _Bel_ the road, the way. Ku-bel, the road, the origin of the gods as among the Hindostanees. These, we have seen in the Rig Veda, called Maya, the feminine energy--the productive virtue of Brahma. I do not pretend to present here anything but facts, resulting from my study of the ancient monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of the Maya language, in which the ancient inscriptions, I have been able to decipher, are written. Let us see if those _facts_ are sustained by others of a different character. I will make a brief parallel between the architectural monuments of the primitive Chaldeans, their mode of writing, their burial places, and give you the etymology of the names of their divinities in the American Maya language. The origin of the primitive Chaldees is yet an unsettled matter among learned men. Some professing one opinion, others another. All agree, however, that they were strangers to the lower",
