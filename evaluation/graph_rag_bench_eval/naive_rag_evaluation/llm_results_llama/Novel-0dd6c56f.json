It will make you feel exactly as if you were dead and buried.\" That not being the prominent object of our tour in Cornwall, we thanked him again, but as soon as he left the carriage determined among ourselves to take no further steps about visiting Gerrans. [Illustration: VIEW OF FLUSHING FROM THE GREEN BANK HOTEL, FALMOUTH.] However, in spite of the urgency of another fellow-traveller--it is always good to hear everybody's advice, and follow your own--we carried our love of quietness so far that we eschewed the magnificent new Falmouth Hotel, with its _table d'hote_, lawn tennis ground, sea baths and promenade, for the old-fashioned Green Bank, which though it had no green banks, boasted, we had been told, a pleasant little sea view and bay view, and was a resting-place full of comfort and homely peace. Which we found true, and would have liked to stay longer in its pleasant shelter, which almost conquered our horror of hotels; but we had now fairly weighed anchor and must sail on. \"You ought to go at once to the Lizard,\" said the friend who met us, and did everything for us at Falmouth--and the remembrance of whom, and of all that happened in our brief stay, will make the very name of the place sound sweet in our ears",

The building had just been finished and furnished for occupancy. A strong wind was raging and the little band of firemen were unable to save the structure. The names of Rev. D.D. Neill, Isaac Markley, Bartlett Presley and W.M. Stees were among the firemen who assisted in saving the furniture. The Sintominie hotel on the corner of Sixth and John streets, was the second hotel to receive a visit from the fire king. This hotel was constructed by the late C.W. Borup, and it was the pride of lower town. Howard Ward and E.C. Rich were preparing to open it when the fire occurred. Owing to the lack of fire protection the building was totally destroyed. Early in the winter of 1856 the Rice house, commonly supposed to be the first brick building erected in St. Paul, was burned to the ground. It was three stories high, and when in process of building was considered a visionary enterprise. The building was constructed by Henry M. Rice, and he spared no expense to make it as complete as the times would allow. It was situated on Third street near Market, and in the early days was considered St. Paul's principal hotel. In its parlor and barroom the second session of the territorial legislature was held, and the supreme court of the",

Larpenteur. The New England, a two-story log house, and one of the first hotels built in St. Paul was among the ruins. The New England was a feature in St. Paul, and it was pointed out to newcomers as the first gubernatorial mansion, and in which Gov. and Mrs. Ramsey had begun housekeeping in 1849. The Empire saloon was another historic ruin, for in its main portion the first printing office of the territory had long held forth, and from it was issued the first Pioneer, April 10, 1849. The Hotel to the Wild Hunter was also destroyed at this fire. In the fall of 1862 the Winslow house, located at Seven Corners, was entirely destroyed by fire. A defective stovepipe in the cupola caused the fire, and it spread so rapidly that it was beyond the control of the firemen when they arrived upon the scene. A few pieces of furniture, badly damaged, was all that was saved of this once popular hotel. The Winslow was a four-story brick building, and with the exception of the Fuller house the largest hotel in the city. The hotel was constructed in 1854 by the late J.M. Winslow.",
