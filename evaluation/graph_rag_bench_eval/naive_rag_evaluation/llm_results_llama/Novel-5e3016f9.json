As the brain has so much work to attend to, it must have very pure, good blood sent to it, to keep it strong. Good blood is made from good food. It can not be good if it has been poisoned with alcohol or tobacco. We must also remember that the brain needs a great deal of blood. If we take alcohol into our blood, much of it goes to the brain. There it affects the nerves, and makes a man lose control over his actions. EXERCISE. When you run, you can feel your heart beating. It gets an instant of rest between the beats. Good exercise in the fresh air makes the heart work well and warms the body better than a fire could do. DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE HEART? Your heart is made of muscle. You know what harm alcohol does to the muscles. Could a fatty heart work as well as a muscular heart? No more than a fatty arm could do the work of a muscular arm. Besides, alcohol makes the heart beat too fast, and so it gets too tired. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. Where is the heart placed?           2. Of what is it made?           3. What work does it",

As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the body. These tubes are called arteries (aer't[)e]r iz). Those tubes which bring the blood back again to the heart, are called veins (v[=a]nz). You can see some of the smaller veins in your wrist. If you press your finger upon an artery in your wrist, you can feel the steady beating of the pulse. This tells just how fast the heart is pumping and the blood flowing. The doctor feels your pulse when you are sick, to find out whether the heart is working too fast, or too slowly, or just right. Some way is needed to send the gray fluid that is made from the food we eat and drink, to every part of the body. To send the food with the blood is a sure way of making it reach every part. So, when the stomach has prepared the food, the blood takes it up and carries it to every part of the body. It then leaves with each part, just what it needs. THE BLOOD AND THE BRAIN.

If all this bad blood goes back to the heart, will the heart have to pump out bad blood next time? No, for the heart has neighbors very near at hand, ready to change the bad blood to pure, red blood again. THE LUNGS. These neighbors are the lungs. They are in the chest on each side of the heart. When you breathe, their little air-cells swell out, or expand, to take in the air. Then they contract again, and the air passes out through your mouth or nose. The lungs must have plenty of fresh air, and plenty of room to work in. [Illustration: _The lungs, heart, and air-passages._] If your clothes are too tight and the lungs do not have room to expand, they can not take in so much air as they should. Then the blood can not be made pure, and the whole body will suffer. For every good breath of fresh air, the lungs take in, they send out one of impure air. In this way, by taking out what is bad, they prepare the blood to go back to the heart pure and red, and to be pumped out through the body again. How the lungs can use the fresh air for doing this good work, you can not yet",

The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku lar) walls. Every time we breathe, these walls have to move. The muscles of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you breathe. All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is directed by the nerves.
