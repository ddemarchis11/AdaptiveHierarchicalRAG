  "llm_answer": "In the scenes where Latimer meets with the bishop to ask for Ellen's hand in marriage, the bishop's demeanor reveals both his confidence in Latimer and his role as a judge of Latimer's character and intentions in several ways:\n\n1. **Initial warmth and familiarity**: The bishop greets Latimer warmly, indicating that he has a positive opinion of the young man. He also mentions that he has enjoyed Latimer's company and has been impressed by his views and conversation. This suggests that the bishop has a certain level of confidence in Latimer's character and intentions.\n\n2. **Shift to a more formal tone**: However, as the conversation progresses, the bishop's tone becomes more formal and judicial. He begins to ask questions that imply he is evaluating Latimer's suitability as a suitor for his daughter's hand. This shift in tone reveals the bishop's role as a judge of Latimer's character and intentions.\n\n3. **Use of phrases like \"I must know\" and \"I must confess\"**: The bishop's use of phrases like \"I must know\" and \"I must confess\" suggests that he is taking on a more formal and authoritative role. He is no longer simply engaging in a friendly conversation, but is instead conducting a thorough examination of Latimer's character and intentions.\n\n4. **Expression of hope and expectation**: The bishop's statement that he is \"confident\" that Latimer will be able to answer his questions and that the conversation will \"satisfy us both\" suggests that he has a certain level of confidence in Latimer's character and intentions. However, this confidence is tempered by his role as a judge, and he is still evaluating Latimer's suitability as a suitor.\n\n5. **Body language and nonverbal cues**: The bishop's body language and nonverbal cues also reveal his role as a judge. He leans forward, touches the paper in front of him, and pushes the manuscript to one side, indicating that he is focused and intent on the conversation. He also glances at Latimer with a keen eye, suggesting that he is carefully evaluating the young man's responses.\n\nOverall, the bishop's demeanor reveals both his confidence in Latimer and his role as a judge of Latimer's character and intentions. He is a complex figure who is both warm and formal, confident and evaluative.",

Young Latimer bowed his head and murmured something inarticulately in reply, and then held his head erect again and waited, still watching the bishop's face. \"I think she might have told me,\" said the older man; \"but then I suppose this is the better way. I am young enough to understand that the old order changes, that the customs of my father's time differ from those of to-day. And there is no alternative, I suppose,\" he said, shaking his head. \"I am stopped and told to deliver, and have no choice. I will get used to it in time,\" he went on, \"but it seems very hard now. Fathers are selfish, I imagine, but she is all I have.\" Young Latimer looked gravely into the fire and wondered how long it would last. He could just hear the piano from below, and he was anxious to return to her. And at the same time he was drawn toward the older man before him, and felt rather guilty, as though he really were robbing him. But at the bishop's next words he gave up any thought of a speedy release, and settled himself in his chair. \"We are still to have a long talk,\" said the bishop. \"There are many things I must know, and of which I am sure you will inform me freely.

You see how preposterous it is, how unjust it is to me. You cannot mean--\" The girl raised her head and shrugged her shoulders slightly as though she were cold. \"Father,\" she said, wearily, \"ask him to go away, Why does he stay? Ask him to go away.\" Latimer stopped and took a step back as though some one had struck him, and then stood silent with his face flushed and his eyes flashing. It was not in answer to anything that they said that he spoke, but to their attitude and what it suggested. \"You stand there,\" he began, \"you two stand there as though I were something unclean, as though I had committed some crime. You look at me as though I were on trial for murder or worse. Both of you together against me. What have I done? What difference is there? You loved me a half-hour ago, Ellen; you said you did. I know you loved me; and you, sir,\" he added, more quietly, \"treated me like a friend. Has anything come since then to change me or you? Be fair to me, be sensible. What is the use of this? It is a silly, needless, horrible mistake. You know I love",

I believe there are some who consider me hard, and even narrow on different points, but I do not think you will find me so, at least let us hope not. I must confess that for a moment I almost hoped that you might not be able to answer the questions I must ask you, but it was only for a moment. I am only too sure you will not be found wanting, and that the conclusion of our talk will satisfy us both. Yes, I am confident of that.\" His manner changed, nevertheless, and Latimer saw that he was now facing a judge and not a plaintiff who had been robbed, and that he was in turn the defendant. And still he was in no way frightened. \"I like you,\" the bishop said, \"I like you very much. As you say yourself, I have seen a great deal of you, because I have enjoyed your society, and your views and talk were good and young and fresh, and did me good. You have served to keep me in touch with the outside world, a world of which I used to know at one time a great deal. I know your people and I know you, I think, and many people have spoken to me of you. I see why now. They, no doubt, understood what was coming better than myself, and were meaning to reassure",

However,\" he added, smiling, as he pushed the manuscript to one side, \"we are not going to talk about that now. What have you to tell me that is new?\" The younger man glanced up quickly at this, but the bishop's face showed that his words had had no ulterior meaning, and that he suspected nothing more serious to come than the gossip of the clubs or a report of the local political fight in which he was keenly interested, or on their mission on the East Side. But it seemed an opportunity to Latimer. \"I _have_ something new to tell you,\" he said, gravely, and with his eyes turned toward the open fire, \"and I don't know how to do it exactly. I mean I don't just know how it is generally done or how to tell it best.\" He hesitated and leaned forward, with his hands locked in front of him, and his elbows resting on his knees. He was not in the least frightened. The bishop had listened to many strange stories, to many confessions, in this same study, and had learned to take them as a matter of",

Can I risk that?\" \"But I tell you it is impossible,\" cried the young man. \"The woman is beyond the love of any man, at least such a man as I am, or try to be.\" \"Do you mean,\" asked the bishop, gently, and with an eager look of hope, \"that she is dead?\" Latimer faced the father for some seconds in silence. Then he raised his head slowly. \"No,\" he said, \"I do not mean she is dead. No, she is not dead.\" Again the bishop moved back wearily into his chair. \"You mean then,\" he said, \"perhaps, that she is a married woman?\" Latimer pressed his lips together at first as though he would not answer, and then raised his eyes coldly. \"Perhaps,\" he said. The older man had held up his hand as if to signify that what he was about to say should be listened to without interruption, when a sharp turning of the lock of the door caused both father and the suitor to start.
