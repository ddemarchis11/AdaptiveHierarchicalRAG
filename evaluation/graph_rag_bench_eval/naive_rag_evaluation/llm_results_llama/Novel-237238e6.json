  "question": "How can consuming candy ultimately lead to the presence of alcohol in the body, and what role does sugar play in this process?",
  "gold_answer": "Candy contains sugar, and sugar is changed into alcohol.",
  "llm_answer": "The text does not directly explain how consuming candy can lead to the presence of alcohol in the body. However, it does mention that sugar can be converted into fat, and that fat can be converted into alcohol through a process called fermentation.\n\nFermentation is a natural process that occurs when yeast or bacteria feed on sugars and convert them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process can occur in the body when there is an overgrowth of yeast or bacteria in the digestive system.\n\nIn the case of candy, if it contains sugar that is not fully digested or absorbed by the body, it can be fermented by the bacteria in the gut, producing alcohol as a byproduct. This process is more likely to occur if the individual has an imbalance of gut bacteria or other digestive issues.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the text does not provide a clear explanation of how consuming candy can lead to the presence of alcohol in the body. The relationship between sugar, fermentation, and alcohol production is more complex and involves multiple factors, including the type of sugar, the presence of yeast or bacteria, and the individual's digestive health.\n\nIn general, it's unlikely that consuming candy would lead to significant levels of alcohol in the body. However, it's possible that small amounts of alcohol could be produced through fermentation in the gut, particularly if the individual has underlying digestive issues or an imbalance of gut bacteria.",

We would not need to be quite so much afraid of a little candy if it were not for the poison with which it is often . Even what is called pure, white candy is sometimes not really such. There is a simple way by which you can find this out for yourselves. If you put a spoonful of sugar into a tumbler of water, it will all dissolve and disappear. Put a piece of white candy into a tumbler of water; and, if it is made of pure sugar only, it will dissolve and disappear. If it is not, you will find at the bottom of the tumbler some white earth. This is not good food for anybody. Candy-makers often put it into candy in place of sugar, because it is cheaper than sugar. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. Why do we need food?           2.

The Esquimaux, who live in the lands of snow and ice, catch a great many walrus and seal, and eat a great deal of fat meat. You would not be well unless you ate some fat or butter or oil. WHAT WILL MAKE FAT? Sugar will make fat, and so will starch, cream, rice, butter, and fat meat. As milk will make muscle and fat and bones, it is the best kind of food. Here, again, it is the earth that sends us our food. Fat meat comes from animals well fed on grain and grass; sugar, from sugar-cane, maple-trees, or beets; oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and starch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and other grains. Green apples and other unripe fruits are not yet ready to be eaten. The starch which we take for food has to be changed into sugar, before it can mix with the blood and help feed the body. As the sun ripens fruit, it changes its starch to sugar. You can tell this by the difference in the taste of ripe and unripe apples. CANDY.

This juice is mostly water, sweetened with a sugar of its own. It is flavored with something which makes us know, the moment we taste it, that it is grape-juice, and not cherry-juice or plum-juice. Apples also contain water, sugar, and apple flavor; and cherries contain water, sugar, and cherry flavor. The same is true of other fruits. They all, when ripe, have the water and the sugar; and each has a flavor of its own. Ripe grapes are sometimes gathered and put into great tubs called vats. In these the juice is squeezed out. In some countries, this squeezing is done by bare-footed men who jump into the vats and press the grapes with their feet. The grape-juice is then drawn off from the skins and seeds and left standing in a warm place. Bubbles soon begin to rise and cover the top of it with froth. The juice is all in motion. [Illustration: _Picking grapes and making wine._] If the cook had wished to use this grape-juice to make jelly, she would say: \"Now, I can not make my grape-jelly, for the grape-juice is spoiled.\" WHAT",
