  "llm_answer": "According to the discussion in the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, children's bones are more flexible and able to bend easily compared to the bones of old people because they contain more gristle. Gristle is a soft, elastic part of the bone that allows it to bend and twist without breaking. As people age, their bones contain more lime, which makes them harder and more prone to breaking. This is why children's bones are more flexible and able to bend easily, while old people's bones are more brittle and prone to breaking.",

Children's bones have more gristle than those of older people; so children's bones bend easily. I know a lady who has one leg shorter than the other. This makes her lame, and she has to wear a boot with iron supports three or four inches high, in order to walk at all. One day she told me how she became lame. \"I remember,\" she said, \"when I was between three and four years old, sitting one day in my high chair at the table, and twisting one foot under the little step of the chair. The next morning I felt lame; but nobody could tell what was the matter. At last, the doctors found out that the trouble all came from that twist. It had gone too far to be cured. Before I had this boot, I could only walk with a crutch.\" CARE OF THE SPINE. Because the spine is made of little bones with cushions between them, it bends easily, and children sometimes bend it more than they ought. If you lean over your book or your writing or any other work, the elastic cushions may get so pressed on the inner edge that they do not easily spring back into shape. In this way, you may grow round-shouldered or hump-backed. This bending over, also",

This bending over, also cramps the lungs, so that they do not have all the room they need for breathing. While you are young, your bones are easily bent. One shoulder or one hip gets higher than the other, if you stand unevenly. This is more serious, because you are growing, and you may grow crooked before you know it. Now that you know how soft your bones are, and how easily they bend, you will surely be careful to sit and stand erect. Do not twist your legs, or arms, or shoulders; for you want to grow into straight and graceful men and women, instead of being round-shouldered, or hump-backed, or lame, all your lives. When people are old, their bones contain more lime, and, therefore, break more easily. You should be kindly helpful to old people, so that they may not fall, and possibly break their bones. CARE OF THE FEET. Healthy children are always out-growing their shoes, and sometimes faster than they wear them out. Tight shoes cause corns and in-growing nails and other sore places on the feet. All of these are very hard to get rid of. No one should wear a shoe that pinches or hurts the foot. OUGHT A BOY TO USE TOBACCO? Perhaps some boy will say: \"Grown people are",

What parts of our bodies are jointed together so nicely? Our bones. How many bones have we? If you should count all your bones, you would find that each of you has about two hundred. Some are large; and some, very small. There are long-hones in your legs and arms, and many short ones in your fingers and toes. The backbone is called the spine. [Illustration: _Backbone of a fish._] If you look at the backbone of a fish, you can see that it is made up-of many little bones. Your own spine is formed in much the same way, of twenty-four small bones. An elastic cushion of gristle (gr[)i]s'l) fits nicely in between each little bone and the next. When you bend, these cushions are pressed together on one side and stretched on the other. They settle back into their first shape, as soon as you stand straight again. If you ever rode in a wheelbarrow, or a cart without springs, you know what a jolting it gave you. These little spring cushions keep you from being shaken even more severely every time you move. Twenty-four ribs, twelve on each side, curve around from the spine to the front, or breast, bone. (_See page 38._) They are",

(_See page 38._) They are so covered with flesh that perhaps you can not feel and count them; but they are there. Then you have two flat shoulder-blades, and two collar-bones that almost meet in front, just where your collar fastens. Of what are the bones made? Take two little bones, such as those from the legs or wings of a chicken, put one of them into the fire, when it is not very hot, and leave it there two or three hours. Soak the other bone in some weak muriatic (m[=u] r[)i] [)a]t'[)i]k) acid. This acid can be bought of any druggist. You will have to be careful in taking the bone out of the fire, for it is all ready to break. If you strike it a quick blow, it will crumble to dust. This dust we call lime, and it is very much like the lime from which the mason makes mortar. [Illustration: _Bone tied to a knot._] The acid has taken the lime from the other bone, so only the part which is not lime is left. You will be surprised to see how easily it will bend. You can twist it and tie it into a knot; but it will not easily break. You have seen gristle in",
