In February, 1861, the ladies of the different Protestant churches of St. Paul, with the aid of the Young Men's Christian association, gave a social and supper in this building for the purpose of raising funds for the establishment of a library. It was a sort of dedicatory opening of the building and hall, and was attended by large delegations from the different churches. Quite a large sum was realized. A room was fitted up on the second story and the beginning of what is now the St. Paul library soon opened up to the public. About 350 books were purchased with the funds raised by the social, and the patrons of the library were required to pay one dollar per year for permission to read them. Dr. T.D. Simonton was the first librarian. Subsequently this library was consolidated with the St. Paul Mercantile Library association and the number of books more than doubled. A regular librarian was then installed with the privilege of reading the library's books raised to two dollars per annum. The People's theater, an old frame building on the corner of Fourth and St. Peter streets, was the only real theatrical building in the city. H. Van Liew was the lessee and manager of this place of entertainment, and he was provided with a very good stock company. Emily Dow and her brother, Harry Gossan and Azelene Allen were among the members. During the summer of 1858",

Wallack came to St. Paul and played a two weeks' engagement. They were the most prominent actors who had yet appeared in this part of the country. \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" and \"Macbeth\" were on their repertoire. Probably \"Macbeth\" was never played to better advantage or to more appreciative audiences than it was during the stay of the Wallacks. Mrs. Wallack's Lady Macbeth was a piece of acting that few of the present generation can equal. Col. R.E.J. Miles was one of the stars at this theater, and it was at this place that he first produced the play of \"Mazeppa,\" which afterward made him famous. A.M. Carver, foreman of the job department of the St. Paul Times, often assisted in theatrical productions. Mr. Carver was not only a first-class printer, but he was also a very clever actor. His portrayal of the character of Uncle Tom in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" which had quite a run, and was fully equal to any later production by full fledged members of the dramatic profession. Mr. Carver was one of the first presidents of the International Typographical union, and died in Cincinnati many years ago, leaving a memory that will ever be cherished by all",

They had just received their Minie rifles and bayonets, and, with the drum-major headgear worn by military companies in those days, presented a very imposing appearance. The Pioneer Guards were followed by the City Guards, under Capt. John O'Gorman. A detachment of cavalry and the City Battery completed the military part of the affair. The fire department, under the superintendence of the late Charles H. Williams, consisting of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company, Minnehaha Engine company, Hope Engine company and the Rotary Mill company was the next in order. One of the most attractive features of the occasion was the contribution of the Pioneer Printing company. In a large car drawn by six black horses an attempt was made to give an idea of printers and printing in the days of Franklin, and also several epochs in the life of the great philosopher. In the car with the representatives of the art preservative was Miss Azelene Allen, a beautiful and popular young actress connected with the People's theater, bearing in her hand a cap of liberty on a spear. She represented the Goddess of Liberty. The car was ornamented with flowers and the horses were decorated with the inscriptions \"Franklin,\" \"Morse,\" \"Field.\" The Pioneer book bindery was also represented in one of the floats, and workmen, both male and female, were employed in different branches of the business.

The sight of a group of prisoners bound by a chain calls to his memory his former sentimental extravagance, and he exclaims: “Twenty years ago, when I was still a sentimental traveler, I would have wasted many an ‘Oh’ and ‘alas’ over this scene; at present, since I have learned to know the world and mankind somewhat more intimately, I think otherwise.” Johann Christian Bock (1724-1785), who was in 1772 theater-poet of the Ackerman Company in Hamburg, soon after the publication of the Sentimental Journey, identified himself with the would-be Yoricks by the production of “Die Tagereise,” which was published at Leipzig in 1770. The work was re-issued in 1775 with the new title “Die Geschichte eines empfundenen Tages.”[25] The only change in the new edition was the addition of a number of copperplate engravings. The book is inspired in part by Sterne directly, and in part indirectly through the intermediary Jacobi. Unlike the work of Schummel just treated, it betrays no Shandean influence, but is dependent solely on the Sentimental Journey. In outward form the book resembles Jacobi’s “Winterreise,” since verse is introduced to vary the prose narrative. The attitude of the author toward his journey, undertaken",

It was not until the winter of 1866-67 that St. Paul could boast of a genuine opera house. The old opera house fronting on Wabasha street, on the ground that is now occupied by the Grand block, was finished that winter and opened with a grand entertainment given by local talent. The boxes and a number of seats in the parquet were sold at auction, the highest bidder being a man by the name of Philbrick, who paid $72 for a seat in the parquet. This man Philbrick was a visitor in St. Paul, and had a retinue of seven or eight people with him. It was whispered around that he was some kind of a royal personage, and when he paid $72 for a seat at the opening of the opera house people were sure that he was at least a duke. He disappeared as mysteriously as he had appeared. It was learned afterward that this mysterious person was Coal Oil Johnny out on a lark. The first regular company to occupy this theater was the Macfarland Dramatic company, with Emily Melville as the chief attraction. This little theater could seat about 1,000 people, and its seating capacity was taxed many a time long before the Grand opera house in the rear was constructed.
