I've cooked Dandy Dick! [_He moves from the table in horror._] Oh! I'm only a hamatoor sportsman and I can't afford a uncertainty. [_As THE DEAN returns, BLORE starts up guiltily._] Can I help you any more, Sir? THE DEAN. No, remove these dreadful things, and don't let me see you again to-night!

But after to-morrow I'll retire from the Turf, if only to reclaim 'im. [_He goes out._ THE DEAN. [_Putting on his coat._] I don't contemplate my humane task with resignation.

Blore, I feel it would be a humane act to administer to the poor ignorant animal in my stable a simple Bolus as a precaution against chill.

In America Mr. Daly produced \"Dandy Dick\" with Miss Ada Rehan in Mrs. John Wood's part, but no very great success was achieved; whereas in Australia its reception was so enthusiastic that it ran for quite an unusual time both in Melbourne and Sydney. In the character of the Dean, Mr. G. W. Anson achieved perhaps the greatest of his Australian successes, and Mr. Robert Brough made his mark as the policeman. MALCOLM C. SALAMAK. _December_, 1892.
