  "question": "What types of musical instruments were found in the Kensington museum, such as the cither, harpsichord, clavichord, spinet, and virginal, and which cultures—like the North American Indians—are represented by the specimens in the museum's collection?",
  "gold_answer": "The Kensington museum contained the cither, harpsichord, clavichord, spinet, virginal, and specimens of musical instruments of the North American Indians.",
  "llm_answer": "The Kensington museum, likely referring to the South Kensington Museum in London, contains a collection of various musical instruments, including:\n\n1. Cither\n2. Harpsichord\n3. Clavichord\n4. Spinet\n5. Virginal\n\nThese instruments were popular during the last three centuries and have been preserved in the museum. \n\nThe museum's collection also includes specimens of musical instruments from various cultures, including:\n\n1. North American Indians: The museum contains specimens of their musical instruments, such as rattles, drums, flutes, and whistles, which are genuine old Indian contrivances.\n2. Asiatic nations: The museum has instruments still in use in Egypt and western Asia, which are similar to those represented on monuments dating from a period of three thousand years ago.\n3. Aztecs in Mexico and Peruvians: The museum contains pipes and flutes made of pottery or bone, which are remarkably well-preserved and provide valuable insights into the musical system prevalent among these people.\n4. African instruments: Some African instruments, introduced by slaves, are also found in the museum, such as the marimba, which has become popular with the natives of Guatemala in central America.",

      "text": "and the _chitarrone_. It is unnecessary to enter here into a detailed description of some other instruments which have been popular during the last three centuries, for the museum at Kensington contains specimens of many of them of which an account is given in the large catalogue of that collection. It must suffice to refer the reader to the illustrations there of the cither, virginal, spinet, clavichord, harpsichord, and other antiquated instruments much esteemed by our forefathers. Students who examine these old relics will probably wish to know something about their quality of tone. “How do they sound? Might they still be made effective in our present state of the art?” are questions which naturally occur to the musical inquirer having such instruments brought before him. A few words bearing on these questions may therefore not be out of place here. [Illustration] It is generally and justly admitted that in no other branch of the art of music has greater progress been made since the last century than in the construction of musical instruments. Nevertheless, there are people who think that we have also lost something here which might with advantage be restored. Our various instruments by being more and more perfected are becoming too much alike in quality of sound, or in that character of tone which the French call _timbre_, and the Germans _Klangfarbe_, and which professor Tyndall in his lectures on sound has translated _clang-tint_. Every musical composer knows how much more",

In Peru a similar experiment, resorted to by the priests who accompanied Pizarro’s expedition, proved equally successful. They dramatized certain scenes in the life of Christ and represented them with music, which so greatly fascinated the Indians that many of them readily embraced the new faith. Nor are these entertainments dispensed with even at the present day by the Indian Christians, especially in the village churches of the Sierra in Peru; and as several religious ceremonies have been retained by these people from their heathen forefathers, it may be conjectured that their sacred musical performances also retain much of their ancient heathen character. Most of the musical instruments found among the American Indians at the present day are evidently genuine old Indian contrivances as they existed long before the discovery of America. Take, for example, the peculiarly shaped rattles, drums, flutes, and whistles of the North American Indians, of which some specimens in the Kensington museum are described in the large catalogue. A few African instruments, introduced by the <DW64> slaves, are now occasionally found in the hands of the Indians, and have been by some travellers erroneously described as genuine Indian inventions. This is the case with the African _marimba_, which has become rather popular with the natives of Guatemala in central America: but such adaptations are very",

      "text": "instruments which were highly popular about a hundred years ago have either fallen into disuse or are now so much altered that they may almost be considered as new inventions. Among Asiatic nations, on the other hand, we meet with several instruments which have retained unchanged through many centuries their old construction and outward appearance. At South Kensington may be seen instruments still in use in Egypt and western Asia, precisely like specimens represented on monuments dating from a period of three thousand years ago. By a reference to the eastern instruments of the present time we obtain therefore a key for investigating the earlier Egyptian and Assyrian representations of musical performances; and, likewise, for appreciating more exactly the biblical records respecting the music of the Hebrews. Perhaps these evidences will convey to some inquirers a less high opinion than they have hitherto entertained, regarding the musical accomplishments of the Hebrew bands in the solemn processions of king David or in Solomon’s temple; but the opinion will be all the nearer to the truth. There is another point of interest about such collections, and especially that at South Kensington, which must not be left unnoticed. Several instruments are remarkable on account of their elegant shape and tasteful ornamentation. This is particularly the case with some specimens from Asiatic countries. The beautiful designs with which they are embellished may afford valuable patterns for study and for adoption in works of art. CHAPTER II. A really complete account of all the musical instruments from the earliest time known to us would require much more space than",

Several of them are constructed in a manner which, in some degree, reveals the characteristics of the musical system prevalent among the people who used the instruments. And although most of these interesting relics, which have been obtained from tombs and other hiding-places, may not be of great antiquity, it has been satisfactorily ascertained that they are genuine contrivances of the Indians before they were influenced by European civilization. Some account of these relics is therefore likely to prove of interest also to the ethnologist, especially as several facts may perhaps be found of assistance in elucidating the still unsolved problem as to the probable original connection of the American with Asiatic races. Among the instruments of the Aztecs in Mexico and of the Peruvians none have been found so frequently, and have been preserved in their former condition so unaltered, as pipes and flutes. They are generally made of pottery or of bone, substances which are unsuitable for the construction of most other instruments, but which are remarkably well qualified to withstand the decaying influence of time. There is, therefore, no reason to conclude from the frequent occurrence of such instruments that they were more common than other kinds of which specimens have rarely been discovered. [Illustration] The Mexicans possessed a small whistle formed of baked clay, a considerable number of which have been found. Some specimens (of which we give engravings) are singularly grotesque in shape, representing caricatures of",

The reader unacquainted with the pentatonic scale may ascertain its character by playing on the pianoforte the scale of C major with the omission of _f_ and _b_ (the _fourth_ and _seventh_); or by striking the black keys in regular succession from _f_-sharp to the next _f_-sharp above or below. Another curious wind-instrument of high antiquity, the _cheng_, (engraved, p. 46) is still in use. Formerly it had either 13, 19, or 24 tubes, placed in a calabash; and a long curved tube served as a mouth-piece. In olden time it was called _yu_. The ancient stringed instruments, the _kin_ and _chê_, were of the dulcimer kind: they are still in use, and specimens of them are in the South Kensington museum. The Buddhists introduced from Thibet into China their god of music, who is represented as a rather jovial-looking man with a moustache and an imperial, playing the _pepa_, a kind of lute with four silken strings. Perhaps some interesting information respecting the ancient Chinese musical instruments may be gathered from the famous ruins of the Buddhist temples _Ongcor-Wat_ and _Ongcor-Thôm_, in Cambodia.
