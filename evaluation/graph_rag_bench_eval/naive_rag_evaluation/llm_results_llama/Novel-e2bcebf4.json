The rest of the company coming soberly in, each gentleman with his partner, saw the heaving and quaking mountain of nuts beneath which the mole was struggling, and he was rescued amid much laughter and merriment. That was a supper indeed! There were nuts of all kinds,--butternuts, chestnuts, beech-nuts, hickories, and hazels. There were huge piles of acorns, of several kinds,--the long slender brown-satin ones, and the fat red-and-brown ones, with a woolly down on them. There were partridge-berries and checkerberries, and piles of fragrant, spicy leaves of wintergreen. And there was sassafras-bark and spruce-gum, and a great dish of golden corn,--a present from the field-cousins. Really, it gives one an appetite only to think of it! And I verily believe that there never was such a nibbling, such a gnawing, such a champing and cracking and throwing away of shells, since first the forest was a forest. When the guests were thirsty, there was root-beer, served in birch-bark goblets; and when one had drunk all the beer one ate the goblet; which was very pleasant, and moreover saved some washing of dishes. And so all were very",

I am disappointed in you, sir; distinctly disappointed!\" There was a pause, in which the delinquent Cracker found nothing to say, and then his uncle added:-- \"And in what condition are your teeth, pray? I suppose you are letting them grow, while you eat those wretched messes of soft food. Have you _any_ proper food, at all?\" \"Oh, yes!\" exclaimed Cracker. \"Indeed, Uncle Munkle, my teeth are in excellent condition. Just look at them!\" and he exhibited two shining rows of teeth as sharp as those of a newly-set saw. \"We have plenty of nuts; more than I ever had before, I assure you. Toto got quantities of them in the autumn, on purpose for me; and there are great heaps of hazels and beech-nuts and hickories piled up in the barn-chamber, where I can go and help myself when I please. And almonds, too!\" he added. \"Oh, they are _so_ jolly!\" Uncle Munkle looked mollified; he even seemed interested. \"Almonds?\" he said. \"They are foreign nuts, and don't grow in this part of the world. I tasted some once. Where did Toto get them, do you think?\" \"He bought them of a pedler,\" said",

But I shall hand the nuts to Cracker first, for he has told us a very good story, whether it is true or not.\" CHAPTER XI. THE apples and nuts went round again and again, and for a few minutes nothing was heard save the cracking of shells and the gnawing of sharp white teeth. At length the parrot said, meditatively:-- \"That was a very stupid cow, though! Are all cows as stupid as that?\" \"Well, I don't think they are what you would call brilliant, as a rule,\" Toto admitted; \"but they are generally good, and that is better.\" \"Hem! possibly!\" said Miss Mary, dryly. \"That is probably why we have no cows in Central Africa. Our animals being all, without exception, clever _and_ good, there is really no place for creatures of the sort you describe.\" \"How about the bogghun, Miss Mary?\" asked the raccoon, slyly, with a wink at Toto. The parrot ruffled up her feathers, and was about to make a sharp reply; but suddenly remembering the raccoon's brave defence of her an hour before, she smoothed her plumage again, and replied gently,-- \"I confess that I forgot the bogghun,",

After a hearty supper, in the course of which Toto related as much of his and Bruin's adventures in the hermit's cave as he thought proper, the whole family gathered around the blazing hearth. Toto brought the pan of apples and the dish of nuts; the grandmother took up her knitting, and said, with a smile: \"And who will tell us a story, this evening? We have had none for two evenings now, and it is high time that we heard something new. Cracker, my dear, is it not your turn?\" \"I think it is,\" said the squirrel, hastily cramming a couple of very large nuts into his cheek-pouches, \"and if you like, I will tell you a story that Mrs. Cow told me a day or two ago. It is about a cow that jumped over the moon.\" \"What!\" cried Toto. \"Why, I've known that story ever since I was a baby! And it isn't a story, either, it's a rhyme,-- \"Hey diddle diddle, The cat and the fiddle, The cow--\" \"Yes, yes! I know, Toto,\" interrupted the squirrel. \"She told me that, too, and said it was a pack of lies, and that people like you didn't know anything about the real truth of the matter.

Ho! ho! what fun it will be! Good-by, Mrs. Speckle! good-by, Cluckety!\" and off ran boy Toto, with his basket of eggs, leaving the two old hens to scratch about in the hay, clucking rather sadly over the memories of their own chickenhood, when they, too, went to parties, instead of laying eggs for other people's festivities. In the cottage, what a bustle was going on! The grandmother was at her pastry-board, rolling out paste, measuring and filling and covering, as quickly and deftly as if she had had two pairs of eyes instead of none at all. The bear, enveloped in a huge blue-checked apron, sat with a large mortar between his knees, pounding away at something as if his life depended on it.
