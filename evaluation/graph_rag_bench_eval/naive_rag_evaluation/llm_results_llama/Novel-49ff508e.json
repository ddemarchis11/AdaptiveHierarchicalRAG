Initially, he encountered three little girls from the East Side who were sitting on a bench beside him, gazing at the swans. However, after a brief conversation with them, he decided to rent a swan-boat and take a ride around the lake. It was during this ride that he came face to face with the burglar.",

But the bench on which he sat was in the shade, and the asphalt walk leading to the street was in the sun, and his cigarette was soothing, so he ignored the near presence of the three little girls, and remained where he was. \"I s'pose,\" said one of the two little girls, in a high, public school voice, \"there's lots to see from those swan-boats that youse can't see from the banks.\" \"Oh, lots,\" assented the girl with long hair. \"If you walked all round the lake, clear all the way round, you could see all there is to see,\" said the third, \"except what there's in the middle where the island is.\" \"I guess it's mighty wild on that island,\" suggested the youngest. \"Eddie Case he took a trip around the lake on a swan-boat the other day. He said that it was grand. He said youse could see fishes and ducks, and that it looked just as if there were snakes and things on the island.\" \"What sort of things?\" asked the other one, in a hushed voice. \"Well, wild things,\" explained the elder, vaguely; \"bears and animals like that, that grow in wild places.\" Van Bibber lit a fresh cigarette, and settled himself comfortably and",

He had told his groom to bring a horse he wanted to try to the Fifty-ninth Street entrance at ten o'clock, and the groom had not appeared. Hence Van Bibber's crossness. He waited as long as his dignity would allow, and then turned off into a by-lane end dropped on a bench and looked gloomily at the Lohengrin swans with the paddle-wheel attachment that circle around the lake. They struck him as the most idiotic inventions he had ever seen, and he pitied, with the pity of a man who contemplates crossing the ocean to be measured for his fall clothes, the people who could find delight in having some one paddle them around an artificial lake. Two little girls from the East Side, with a lunch basket, and an older girl with her hair down her back, sat down on a bench beside him and gazed at the swans. The place was becoming too popular, and Van Bibber decided to move on. But the bench on",

But the elder girl objected. \"I'm afraid maw wouldn't like our taking money from any one we didn't know,\" she said with dignity; \"but if you're going anyway and want company--\" \"Oh! my, no,\" said Van Bibber, hurriedly. He tried to picture himself riding around the lake behind a tin swan with three little girls from the East Side, and a lunch basket. \"Then,\" said the head of the trio, \"we can't go.\" There was such a look of uncomplaining acceptance of this verdict on the part of the two little girls, that Van Bibber felt uncomfortable. He looked to the right and to the left, and then said desperately, \"Well, come along.\" The young man in a blue flannel shirt, who did the paddling, smiled at Van Bibber's riding-breeches, which were so very loose at one end and so very tight at the other, and at his gloves and crop. But Van Bibber pretended not to care. The three little girls placed the awful lunch basket on the front seat and sat on the middle one, and Van",

Then he stepped quickly to where it lay and picked it up and said, \"Now, if you try to get up I'll shoot at you.\" He felt an unwarranted and ill-timedly humorous inclination to add, \"and I'll probably miss you,\" but subdued it. The burglar, much to Van Bibber's astonishment, did not attempt to rise, but sat up with his hands locked across his knees and said: \"Shoot ahead. I'd a damned sight rather you would.\" His teeth were set and his face desperate and bitter, and hopeless to a degree of utter hopelessness that Van Bibber had never imagined. \"Go ahead,\" reiterated the man, doggedly, \"I won't move. Shoot me.\" It was a most unpleasant situation. Van Bibber felt the pistol loosening in his hand, and he was conscious of a strong inclination to lay it down and ask the burglar to tell him all about it. \"You haven't got much heart,\" said Van Bibber, finally. \"You're a pretty poor sort of a burglar, I should say.\" \"What's the use?\" said the man, fiercely. \"I won't go back--I won't go back there alive.
