Everywhere, on the stone flags, coolies were dumping down bundles, boxes, jute-bags crammed with heavy objects. Among them, still brawling in bad Hindustani, the little captain gave his orders. At sight of Heywood, however, he began once more to caper, with extravagant grimaces. By his smooth, ruddy face, and tunic of purest white, he seemed a runaway parson gone farther wrong than ever. \"I've come to stay a month!\" he cried; and dancing up, caught Heywood's hands and whirled him about. \"I was fair bursting to see ye, my boy! And here we are, at last!\" Though his cheeks were flushed, and eyes alarmingly bright, he was beyond question sober. Over his head, Heywood and Rudolph exchanged an anxious glance. \"Good! but this is Hackh's house--the nunnery,\" said the one; and the other added, \"You're just in time for dinner.\" The captain found these facts to be excruciating. He clapped Rudolph on the arm, and crowed:-- \"Nunnery? We'll make it a bloomin' chummery!--Dinner be 'anged! A banquet. What's more, I've brought the chow\"--he",

How long ago, he thought, the steel was forged for this day. \"It is Fate.\" He looked up sadly. \"Come, show me how to begin; so that I can stand up to him.\" \"Here, then.\" Slowly, easily, his long limbs transformed with a sudden youthful grace, Heywood moved through the seven positions of On Guard. \"Try it.\" Rudolph learned only that his own clumsy imitation was hopeless. \"Once more.--He can't see us.\" Again and again, more and more rapidly, they performed the motions of this odd rehearsal. Suddenly Heywood stepped back, and lowering his point, looked into his pupil's face, long and earnestly. \"For the last time,\" he said: \"won't you let me tell him? This is extremely silly.\" Rudolph hung his head, like a stubborn child. \"Do you still think,\" he answered coldly, \"that I would beg off?\" With a hopeless gesture of impatience, Heywood stepped forward briskly. \"Very well, then. Once more.\" And as their blades clashed softly together, a quick light danced in his eyes. \"Here's how our friend will stick you!\" His point cut a swift little circle, and sped home. By a wild instinct, the novice beat it awkwardly aside. His",

In the shade of the nunnery gate they found Rudolph, who, raising his rattan, saluted them with a pale and stoic gravity. \"Are we ready?\" he asked; and turning, took a slow, cool survey of the nunnery, as though looking his last--from the ditch at their feet to the red tiles, patched with bronze mould, that capped the walls and the roof. \"I never left any place with less regret. Come, let's go.\" The three men had covered some ground before Rudolph broke the silence. \"You'll find a few little things up there in my strong-box, Maurice. Some are marked for you, and the rest--will you send them Home, please?\" He hesitated. \"I hope neither of you will misunderstand me. I'm horribly afraid, but not--but only because this fellow will make me look absurd. If I knew the first motion!\" He broke out angrily. \"I cannot bear to have him laugh, also! I cannot bear!\" Heywood clapped him on the shoulder, and gave a queer cough. \"If that's all, never you fear! I'll teach you your guard. 'Once in a while we can finish in style.' Eh?--Rudie, you blooming German, I--I think we must have been brothers! We'll pull it off yet.\" Heywood spoke with a strange alacrity, and",

No more arrows. Converts behaving splendidly. Two or three have begged for guns.\" \"Give 'em this.\" Heywood skipped up the ladder, to return with a rifle. \"And this belt--Kempner's. Poor chap, he'll never ask you to return them.--Anything else?\" \"No,\" answered Gilly, taking the dead man's weapon, and moving off into the darkness. \"No, except \"--He halted. \"Except if we come to a pinch, and need a man for some tight place, then give me first chance. Won't you? I could do better, now, than--than you younger men. Oh, and Hackh; your efforts to-night--Well, few men would have dared, and I feel immensely grateful.\" He disappeared among the orange trees, leaving Rudolph to think about such gratitude. \"Now, then,\" called Heywood, and stooped to the white bundle at their feet. \"Don't stand looking. Can't be helped. Trust old Gilly to take it like a man. Come bear a hand.\" And between them the two friends carried to the nunnery a tiresome theorist, who had acted once, and now, himself tired",

He started, turned for some rush of overwhelming speech, when a head popped through the window behind them. \"Boot and saddle, Mrs. Forrester,\" announced Heywood. His lean young face was very droll and knowing. \"We're leaving, bottom-side.\" \"Thank you so much, Maurice,\" she answered, perhaps dryly. \"You're a dear, to climb all those dreadful stairs.\" \"Oh!\" said Heywood, with his gray eyes fastened on Rudolph, \"no trouble.\" All three went down the dark well together. When the company were mounted, and trooping downhill through the camphor shadow, Heywood's pony came sidling against Rudolph's, till legging chafed legging. \"You blossomed, old boy,\" he whispered. \"Quite the star, after your comedy turn.\" He reined aside, grinning. \"What price sympathy on a pagoda?\" For that moment, Rudolph could have struck down the one sure friend he had in China.
