  "llm_answer": "In the context of Lower Canadian politics, the struggles between French Canadians and the Chateau Clique, along with the direct conflict between the Chateau Clique and the Patriotes, significantly influenced the shaping and pursuit of reform within the colony.\n\nThe Chateau Clique, a group of English-speaking bureaucrats and politicians, dominated the government of Lower Canada and sought to maintain British control over the colony. They were opposed by the French-speaking Patriotes, who sought greater autonomy and recognition of their language and culture. The conflict between these two groups was a major factor in the shaping of reform within the colony.\n\nThe Patriotes, led by figures such as Louis-Joseph Papineau, sought to reform the government of Lower Canada to give greater power to the elected assembly and to recognize the rights of French-speaking Canadians. They were opposed by the Chateau Clique, who sought to maintain British control over the colony and to limit the power of the elected assembly.\n\nThe conflict between the Chateau Clique and the Patriotes led to a series of reforms, including the introduction of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, which sought to limit the power of the governor and to give greater power to the elected assembly. However, these reforms were ultimately unsuccessful, and the conflict between the Chateau Clique and the Patriotes continued.\n\nThe struggles between French Canadians and the Chateau Clique also influenced the shaping of reform within the colony. The French-speaking population of Lower Canada sought greater recognition of their language and culture, and they were opposed by the English-speaking Chateau Clique, who sought to maintain British control over the colony.\n\nThe conflict between the Chateau Clique and the Patriotes ultimately led to the Rebellion of 1837-1838, in which the Patriotes sought to overthrow the British government and establish an independent republic. However, the rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful, and the conflict between the Chateau Clique and the Patriotes continued.\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, the British government sent Lord Durham to investigate the causes of the conflict and to recommend reforms. Durham's report, known as the Durham Report, recommended the union of Upper and Lower Canada, which was ultimately achieved in 1840. The Durham Report also recommended the establishment of responsible government in Lower Canada, which was achieved in 1848.\n\nIn summary, the struggles between French Canadians and the Chateau Clique, along with the direct conflict between the Chateau Clique and the Patriotes, significantly influenced the shaping and pursuit of reform within the colony. The conflict between these two groups led to a series of reforms, including the introduction of the Ninety-Two Resolutions and the establishment of responsible government in Lower Canada.",

This, though not exactly a suspension of the constitution of Lower Canada and a measure quite legally within the competency of the House of Commons, was a flat negative to the claim of the Lower-Canadian Assembly to control over the executive government, through the power of the purse or otherwise. A long and important debate in Parliament followed on these resolutions. Some of the chief political leaders of the day took part in the discussion. Daniel O'Connell, the great {60} tribune of the Irish people, took up the cudgels for the French Canadians. Doubtless it seemed to him that the French Canadians, like the Irish, were victims of Anglo-Saxon tyranny and bigotry. Sir George Grey, the colleague of Gosford, Lord Stanley, a former colonial secretary, and William Ewart Gladstone, then a vigorous young Tory, spoke in support of the resolutions. The chief opposition came from the Radical wing of the Whig party, headed by Hume and Roebuck; but these members were comparatively few in number, and the resolutions were passed by overwhelming majorities.
