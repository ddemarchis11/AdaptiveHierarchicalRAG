  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — My days with my mistress were filled with warmth and chatter. Today, I said farewell to Corinna, her eyes glistening with sorrow. I was snatched away by envy, separated from her gentle hands. I have heard it said that my mistress is born to be a cause of trouble to her lover, and perhaps, even my loss plays a part in the tangled affairs of the heart.",
  "llm_answer": "March 15th, Year of the Golden Sun\n\nOh, the memories that flood my mind like a river of sorrow. I can hardly believe it's been a week since I left this mortal coil. My life was a tapestry of joy and companionship, woven with the threads of love and affection. I was the beloved parrot of my mistress, Corinna, and I reveled in her attention and adoration.\n\nI remember the day I arrived at her doorstep, a gift from a far-off land, my vibrant plumage and melodious voice captivating her heart. She would spend hours with me, teaching me to mimic her words, and I would delight her with my clever imitations. I was more than just a pet; I was her confidant, her companion, and her friend.\n\nBut alas, my presence was not without its consequences. Her lover, a poet, would often visit, and I would chatter and squawk, trying to get his attention. He would laugh and play with me, but I could sense the tension between them. He would try to woo her with his words, but I would interrupt, stealing the spotlight with my antics. I didn't mean to cause trouble, but I was a jealous bird, and I couldn't bear to share her attention.\n\nOne fateful day, I said my final farewell to Corinna. I remember the look of sadness in her eyes as I lay on my perch, my tongue faltering as I whispered my last words: \"Corinna, farewell!\" I knew I was leaving her behind, but I also knew that I had lived a life filled with love and joy.\n\nAs I look back, I realize that my departure was not just a loss for Corinna, but also for the poet. He had grown accustomed to my chatter and my presence, and my absence left a void in his life. I had become a part of their little world, and my leaving caused a ripple effect that echoed through their relationship.\n\nBut even in death, I find solace in the knowledge that I lived a life worth living. I brought joy and companionship to those around me, and my memory will live on in the hearts of Corinna and the poet. As I rest in my little tomb, surrounded by the beauty of nature, I am at peace, knowing that I was loved and cherished while I was here.\n\nFarewell, dear friends. May my story be a reminder to cherish the time we have with those we love, and to never take their presence for granted.",

All, who poise yourselves in your career in the liquid air; but you, above the rest, affectionate turtle-dove, [360] lament him. Throughout life there was a firm attachment between you, and your prolonged and lasting friendship endured to the end. What the Phocian youth [361] was to the Argive Orestes, the same, parrot, was the turtle-dove to you, so long as it was allowed _by fate._ But what _matters_ that friendship? What the beauty of your rare plumage? What your voice so ingenious at imitating sounds? What avails it that _ever_ since you were given, you pleased my mistress? Unfortunate pride of _all_ birds, you are indeed laid low. With your feathers you could outvie the green emerald, having your purple beak tinted with the ruddy saffron. There was no bird on earth more skilled at imitating sounds; so prettily [362] did you utter words with your lisping notes. Through envy, you were snatched away _from us_: you were the cause of no cruel wars; you were a chatterer, and the lover of peaceful concord.

If there is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole bird _of its kind. There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers; the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate. Received in this home in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his words.
