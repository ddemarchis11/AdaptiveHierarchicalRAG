When the quaking shadows grew thin and spare, and the lighted clearings dangerously wide, he swerved to the right through a rolling bank of smoke. They coughed as they ran. Once Rudolph paused, with the heat of the fire on his cheeks. \"The nunnery is burning,\" he said hopelessly. His guide halted, peered shrewdly, and listened. \"No, they are still shooting,\" he answered, and limped onward, skirting the uproar. At last, when by pale stars above the smoke and flame and sparks, Rudolph judged that they were somewhere north of the nunnery, they came stumbling down into a hollow encumbered with round, swollen obstacles. Like a patch of enormous melons, oil-jars lay scattered. \"Hide here, and wait,\" commanded Wutzler. \"I will go see.\" And he flitted off through the smoke. Smuggled among the oil-jars, Rudolph lay panting. Shapes of men ran",

Anyhow,--point two,--your house is all hillocks behind, and shops roundabout: here's just one low ridge, and the rest clear field. Third: the Portuguese built a well of sorts in the courtyard; water's deadly, I dare say, but your place has no well whatever. And as to four, suppose--in a sudden alarm, say, those cut off by land could run another half-chance to reach the place by river.--By the way, the nunnery has a bell to ring.\" Gilbert Forrester shoved the map along to his neighbor, and cleared his throat. \"Gentlemen,\" he declared slowly, \"you once did me the honor to say that in--in a certain event, you would consider me as acting head. Frankly, I confess, my plans were quite--ah!--vague. I wish to--briefly, to resign, in favor of this young--ah--bachelor.\" \"Don't go rotting me,\" complained Heywood, and his sallow cheeks turned ruddy. \"I merely bring up these points. And five is this: your compound's very cramped, where the nunnery could shelter the goodly blooming fellowship of native converts.\" Chantel laughed heartily, and stretched his legs",

Sniping all night, will it be?--or shall we get a fair chance at 'em?\" The captain, a small, white, recumbent spectre, lifted his head and appeared to sniff the smoke judicially. \"They get a chance at us, more like!\" he grumbled. \"My opinion, the blighters have shot and burnt themselves into a state o' mind; bloomin' delusion o' grandeur, that's what. Wildest of 'em will rush us to-night, once--maybe twice. We stave 'em off, say: that case, they'll settle down to starve us, right and proper.\" \"Siege,\" assented Heywood. \"Siege, like you read about.\" The captain lay flat again. \"Wish a man could smoke up here.\" Heywood laughed, and turned his head:-- \"How much do you know about sieges, old chap?\" \"Nothing,\" Rudolph confessed. \"Nor I, worse luck. Outside of school--_testudine facia,_ that sort of thing. However,\" he went on cheerfully, \"we shall before long\"--He broke off with a start. \"Rudie! By Jove, I forgot! Did you find them? Where's Bertha Forrester?\" \"Gone,\" said Rudolph, and struggling to explain, found his late adventure",

[Illustration: Portuguese Nunnery:--Sketch Map.] \"What strategy!\" he chuckled, preening his moustache. \"Your mythical siege--it will be brief! For me, I vote no to that: no rice-Christians filling their bellies--eating us into a surrender!\" He made a pantomime of chop-sticks. \"A compound full, eating, eating!\" One or two nodded, approving the retort. Heywood, slightly lifting his chin, stared at the speaker coldly, down the length of their council-board. The red in his cheeks burned darker. \"Our everlasting shame, then,\" he replied quietly. \"It will be everlasting, if we leave these poor devils in the lurch, after cutting them loose from their people. Excuse me, padre, but it's no time to mince our words. We made them strangers in their own land. Desert 'em? Damned if we do!\" No one made reply. The padre, who had looked up, looked down quickly, musing, and smoothed his white hair with big fingers that somewhat trembled. \"Besides,\" continued the speaker, in a tone of apology, \"we'll need 'em to man the works.
