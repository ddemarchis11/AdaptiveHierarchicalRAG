Her love of talking: Eily says, \"An' I _loove_ to talk!\" which suggests that she enjoys speaking and communicating, possibly as a way to gain attention and admiration, which can be associated with wealth and status.\n4. Her reaction to the Green Man's gift: When the Green Man grants her wish, Eily is initially thrilled and excited, indicating that she is pleased with the prospect of possessing wealth and status.\n5. Her conversation with the doctor: Eily's conversation with the doctor, where she talks about her family's connections to the Countess's household and her mother's supposed ability to make butter from skim milk, suggests that she is trying to impress the doctor and gain his attention, possibly as a way to gain wealth or status.\n\nOverall, Eily's words and actions suggest that she aspires to be wealthy and is motivated by a desire for status and admiration.",

Don't decide hastily, or ye may be sorry for it.\" \"Sorry!\" cried Eileen, \"what for wud I be sorry? Sure I'd be richer than the Countess o' Kilmoggen hersilf, let alone the Queen, be the time I'd talked for an hour. An' I _loove_ to talk!\" she added softly, half to herself. The Green Man laughed outright at this. \"Well, Eily,\" he said, \"ye shall have yer own way. Stoop down to me here!\" Eileen bent down, and he touched her lips three times with the scarlet tassel of his cap. \"Slanegher Banegher!\" he said. \"The charm is worked.

The child stood quite still, with her hands clasped, thinking harder than she had ever thought in all her life before; and the Green Man sat on the toadstool and watched her, with eyes which twinkled with some amusement, but no malice. \"Take yer time, my dear,\" he said, \"take yer time! Ye'll not meet a Green Man every day, so make the best o' your chance!\" Suddenly Eily's face lighted up with a sudden inspiration. \"Och!\" she cried, \"sure I have it, yer Riverence's Grace--Honor, I shud say!

Eily paused, fairly out of breath, just as Mrs. O'Shaughnessy entered, bringing her rather scanty supper. There was quite a pile of jewels in her lap and about her feet, while a good many had rolled to a distance; but her heart sank within her as she compared the result of three hours' steady talking with the end to which the rapacious doctor aspired. She was allowed to eat her supper in peace, but no sooner was it finished than the questioning began again, and it was not until",

With her eyes shut, she would not have believed her ears; but the double evidence was too much for her. The diamonds and pearls kept on falling, falling, fast and faster. They filled Eileen's lap, they skipped away over the floor, while the doctor's wife pursued them with frantic eagerness. Each diamond was clear and radiant as a drop of dew, each pearl lustrous and perfect; but they gave no pleasure now to the fairy-gifted child. She could only think of the task that lay before her,--to FILL this great, empty room; of the millions and millions, and yet again millions of gems that must fall from her lips before the floor would be covered even a few inches deep; of the weeks and months,--perhaps the years,--that must elapse before she would see her parents and Phelim again. She remembered the words of the fairy: \"A day may come when you will wish with all your heart to have the charm removed.\" And then, like a flash, came the recollection of those other words: \"When that day comes, come here to this spot,\" and do so and so. In fancy, Eileen was transported again to the pleasant green forest; was looking at the Green Man as he sat on",
