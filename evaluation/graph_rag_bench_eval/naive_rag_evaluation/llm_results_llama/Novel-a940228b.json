  "question": "Retell the story of Corinna’s farewell to her parrot as if you are Corinna, writing in her personal diary. Include the role of Isis as invoked in the triplets.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today was a day of sorrow. My beloved parrot, companion and confidant, was snatched away by envious fate, taken from my side. I said my farewells with heavy heart. In my grief, I called upon Isis, hoping she would turn her features to me and grant comfort. The gods are distant, yet my pain feels as if I am born to be a cause of trouble to my lover.",
  "llm_answer": "February 10th, \n\nToday was the most devastating day of my life. I can barely bring myself to write these words, but I must confess the truth. My beloved parrot, my faithful companion, my confidant, has left me. I am consumed by grief, and my heart aches with every passing moment.\n\nAs I lay on my deathbed, I knew that my time was drawing to a close. I called out to my parrot, and with my final breath, I whispered \"Corinna, farewell!\" I could feel its presence beside me, its gentle eyes gazing at me with love and devotion.\n\nBut even in death, my parrot's spirit remained strong. It spoke out, its voice echoing in my mind, a final farewell to the one it loved. I am told that it was buried in a small grove at the foot of the Elysian hill, a place of beauty and tranquility, where the innocent birds roam free.\n\nAs I reflect on my life, I am reminded of the words of the poet, who invoked the aid of Isis, the great goddess of Egypt, to help me through my labor. He prayed to her, to Anubis, and to Osiris, to grant me life and to bring me comfort. And now, as I face my own mortality, I am grateful for that prayer, for it has brought me peace and solace in my final hours.\n\nMy parrot, dear friend, I will carry you in my heart forever. May your spirit soar free, and may you find joy and happiness in the afterlife. Farewell, my dear one.",

And yet your words did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue cried aloud, \"Corinna, farewell!\" [370] At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green. If there is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole bird _of its kind. There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers; the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate. Received in this home in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his words. [372] A sepulchre covers his bones; a sepulchre small as his body; on which a little stone has _this_ inscription, well suited to itself: \"From this very tomb [377] I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress. I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.\" ELEGY VII. _He attempts to convince his mistress,",

THE apples and nuts went round again and again, and for a few minutes nothing was heard save the cracking of shells and the gnawing of sharp white teeth. At length the parrot said, meditatively:-- \"That was a very stupid cow, though! Are all cows as stupid as that?\" \"Well, I don't think they are what you would call brilliant, as a rule,\" Toto admitted; \"but they are generally good, and that is better.\" \"Hem! possibly!\" said Miss Mary, dryly. \"That is probably why we have no cows in Central Africa. Our animals being all, without exception, clever _and_ good, there is really no place for creatures of the sort you describe.\" \"How about the bogghun, Miss Mary?\" asked the raccoon, slyly, with a wink at Toto. The parrot ruffled up her feathers, and was about to make a sharp reply; but suddenly remembering the raccoon's brave defence of her an hour before, she smoothed her plumage again, and replied gently,-- \"I confess that I forgot the bogghun,",
