    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies the Sultan as the ruler of Morocco and mentions his residence in Fez, which aligns partially with the Gold Answer. However, it introduces unsupported claims about despotic power and subjects being considered slaves, which are not grounded in the retrieved context. Additionally, it does not explicitly mention the Sultan's palace in Morocco, as stated in the Gold Answer."
