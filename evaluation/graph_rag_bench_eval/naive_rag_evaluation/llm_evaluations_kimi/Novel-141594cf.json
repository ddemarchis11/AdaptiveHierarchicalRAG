  "question": "How does the narrative depict the integration of new members into the established group at the Deanery, specifically through Blore's action of being told to show in Major Tarver and the process by which Major Tarver is ultimately accepted by Salome?",
  "gold_answer": "Major Tarver is shown being introduced by Blore and ultimately accepted by Salome, illustrating the process by which new individuals are incorporated into the group.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative shows integration as a staged, almost theatrical negotiation rather than a natural absorption.  \nBlore’s role is purely mechanical: he is “told to show the gentlemen hin” and, once the awkwardness is exposed, is instantly dismissed with the icy command, “You needn’t wait, Blore!” His function is to open the door—nothing more. The real work of acceptance is performed by Salome herself. She begins with startled confusion, shifts to violent nodding when her father issues the dinner invitation, and finally moves to physical reassurance—taking Tarver’s hat, guiding the conversation—signalling that the outsider is now provisionally inside. Thus Blore ushers the body through the door, but Salome’s gesture of possession (“taking his hat”) confers membership.",
