    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Dozmare Pool as the location of Tregeagle's dwelling, which is supported by the retrieved context. However, the Gold Answer specifies 'Cornwall' as the dwelling location, which is broader and also correct. The Model Answer misses this broader aspect, focusing only on the specific location within Cornwall."
