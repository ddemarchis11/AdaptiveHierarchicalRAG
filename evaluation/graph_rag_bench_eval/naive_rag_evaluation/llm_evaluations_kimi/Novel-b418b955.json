  "gold_answer": "The Devil's Throat is identified as a prominent feature of Kynance Cove, which is situated in Cornwall.",
  "llm_answer": "The Devil’s Throat (also called Hell’s Mouth) is a yawning cave with a wide fissure that lies between two rocks on the seaward side of Kynance Cove. It is reached only after a risky scramble along the cliff-face and a perilous jump across a gap; miss your footing and you drop straight into the boiling waves below. Local advice is explicit: visitors may safely explore Asparagus Island off the cove, but they are warned “don’t try the Devil’s Throat.”",
