  "gold_answer": "Toser was visited by Captain Balfour and has Moorish baths.",
  "llm_answer": "In the narrative of Captain Balfour’s travels, Toser is presented as a notable stop in the Jereed region.  The Arabs of Toser proudly claim it is “the finest city in El-Jereed,” describing it as having an area as large as Algiers, encircled by a mud wall and containing mosques, schools, fondouks (inns), and—significantly—“Moorish baths, a luxury rare on the confines of the Desert.”  Thus, within Balfour’s account the city’s importance is underlined both by his personal visit and by the exceptional presence of these Moorish baths, which are singled out as an uncommon amenity so near the desert.",
