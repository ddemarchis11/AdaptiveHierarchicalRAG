    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that the coach arrived at the station, which is a clear and specific destination. The Model Answer incorrectly claims that the stagecoach does not reach any named destination, contradicting the Gold Answer and failing to align with the retrieved context. Additionally, the Model Answer does not provide evidence from the context to support its claim."
