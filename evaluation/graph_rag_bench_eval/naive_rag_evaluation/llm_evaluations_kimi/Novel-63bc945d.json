  "question": "How are the legal, familial, and romantic storylines intertwined through the engagement of Roxie Daymon to Simon, Simon's obtaining a promise from Rose Simon, and Governor Morock's offer to arrange testimony for Roxie Daymon?",
  "gold_answer": "Roxie Daymon was engaged to Simon, Simon obtained a promise from Rose Simon, and Governor Morock offered to arrange the testimony for Roxie Daymon.",
  "llm_answer": "The three strands knot around the question of who will control Simon’s estate.\n\n1. Romantic  \n   - Roxie and young Simon meet, court, and become engaged.  \n   - That engagement gives Roxie a personal, emotional claim on Simon and, she hopes, on whatever he will leave behind.\n\n2. Familial  \n   - Simon is already under a twenty-year-old $20,000 obligation to “Rose and Suza,” two sisters who are Roxie’s aunts.  \n   - Because the debt is still outstanding, those women (and any heirs they name) have a legal/financial interest in Simon’s property that competes with Roxie’s.\n\n3. Legal  \n   - On his death-bed Simon dictates a new will that bypasses the earlier obligation and leaves “all of his possessions, without reserve, to Roxie Daymon.”  \n   - Governor Morock, the only witness, offers—for “a few thousands”—to “arrange the testimony” that will make the will stick in court.  \n   - Cousin Caesar, acting for the Rose-Suza side, is preparing to break that will.\n\nThus the engagement (romantic) gives Roxie the motive to secure the estate; the old debt to her aunts (familial) gives Caesar the standing to attack the will; and Morock’s willingness to sell perjured testimony (legal) is the device meant to defeat that attack and keep the entire fortune in Roxie’s hands.",
