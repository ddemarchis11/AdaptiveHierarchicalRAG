  "question": "Imagine you are launce, a fish found at Lizard. Write a diary entry about the day the boat ventured into your cave.",
  "gold_answer": "Launce’s Diary: The day was peaceful until a boat, with John Curgenven aboard, entered our cave. The water stirred as the boat’s shadow passed over us. The other fishes, always chasing me, seemed distracted by the newcomers. I kept close to the rocks at Lizard, wary of both humans and my fellow fish.",
  "llm_answer": "**Diary of Launce, the Lizard Sand-Eel**  \n*Night of the Thunder-Cave*\n\nThey came again. Not the moon-feet children with their crooked spears and fire-smells, but the big wooden beast that coughs and bleeds black water. It nosed into my cave—*my* cave—where I hide when the moon is too bright and the tide too low. I was curled in the green-dark, tail tucked under a ridge of stone, dreaming of shrimp. Then came the *thump-thump* of oars, the shiver of water, and their shadows fell across the roof like predatory gulls.\n\nI froze. We all froze—my cousins half-buried in the sand, the pipefish clinging to the wall like striped quills. Even the blind prawns stopped their frantic dance. The boat-beast stopped too, right where the light dies and the tunnel narrows to a throat. A hush, then *BOOM!* A thunderclap inside stone. The cave screamed back, the sound rolling over itself like waves stacked tall. My heart beat in my gills. They do this—fire their noise-stick to hear the cave roar. As if the cave were a conch they could blow. As if we were not inside it, trembling.\n\nLight spilled—white, unnatural. One of them held a sun in their hand, a small cruel sun they could switch on and off. It found the silver on my flank; I felt it like a hook. I dove deeper, sand exploding around me in a storm. Others fled too—launce, young blennies, a velvet crab who left one claw behind in his panic. The water thickened with our fear.\n\nThey stayed only a dozen heartbeats, though it felt like a tide-cycle. Laughed, even. One voice—soft, female—said, “Give me but five, nay, two minutes more!” as if the cave were a fair-booth and we the painted prizes. Then the boat-beast turned, drank the light back into itself, and drifted out. The darkness returned, bruised and ringing.\n\nWe waited until the ripples from their oars became the normal pulse of the sea. Slowly, cousins re-emerged, peppered with sand like seasoning. I wrote this in the silt with my tail, then erased it with a flick. Let no record remain for the next intruders. The cave is ours again—until the moon swells and the thunder-boat returns.\n\nTonight I will burrow deeper, below the reach of light and noise. Let them have the open water. The cave keeps its own silence, and we keep its secrets.",
