  "question": "In what way was the city of Hamburg involved in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, especially through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'?",
  "gold_answer": "Hamburg was involved through the Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent, which reviewed Tristram Shandy and was edited by Bode.",
  "llm_answer": "Hamburg played a central part in the German reception of Sterne’s *Tristram Shandy* through two closely-linked channels:\n\n1. The newspaper *Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent* (from 1763-1770) served as an important critical forum.  \n   - In 1764 it printed a detailed, often quoted review of the first German translation (Zückert 1763), correcting its mistakes and offering sample renderings of Sterne’s text.  \n   - The same paper later carried notices and polemics connected with later translations and with Bode’s own work.\n\n2. Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, resident in Hamburg, was successively editor of that newspaper (1762/63) and, a decade later, the translator-publisher of the most influential German version of *Tristram Shandy* (Hamburg, 1774, 9 parts).  \n   - His editorial activity in the 1760s put him in direct contact with contemporary discussion of Sterne; the 1764 review may already reflect his hand.  \n   - In 1774 he issued the complete Hamburg translation, prefaced by a biographical-critical sketch of Sterne that became a standard source for German readers.  \n   - Bode’s list of subscribers (over 650 names) and the re-issue of a second edition in 1769 show how, from Hamburg, his work spread Sterne’s reputation throughout Germany.\n\nThus, through Bode’s dual role as editor of the *Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent* and as translator-publisher, Hamburg functioned as the chief German centre for reviewing, interpreting and disseminating *Tristram Shandy*.",
