    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies the stomach as the part of the body that adapts to variations in food, whereas the Gold Answer specifies the digestive apparatus. The retrieved context does not provide explicit support for the claim that the stomach adapts to food variations, making the answer unfaithful and missing the key fact from the Gold Answer."
