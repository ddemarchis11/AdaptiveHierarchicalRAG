  "question": "Imagine you are Johann Christian Bock. Write a diary entry about your inspiration from Maria of Moulines and your literary achievements.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Jacobi has been a true muse. His story inspired me to pursue my own literary journey, leading to my latest production, 'Die Tagereise'. However, I remain aware of the shifting tides, as Schummel’s lack of influence on my work and the reviews from the Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek suggest our field is ever-changing.",
  "llm_answer": "**Diary of Johann Christian Bock**  \n*Hamburg, 15 October 1772*  \n\nToday the rain taps the leaded panes like a nervous prompter, and I find myself thinking again of Moulines. Not the real town—God knows I have never crossed the Channel—but the Moulines that lives under my ribs, where Maria still sits beneath the poplars, her lap full of withered leaves and her reason gone. When I first read Yorick’s account of her, I felt the same jolt I once knew when the Ackermann’s curtain rose on a hushed auditorium: the sudden hush of a soul laid bare. I said to myself, “That is the Germany I must write.” Not the Germany of polished hexameters and courtly elegies, but the one that bleeds when a lamb is led to slaughter, that buries its dead lap-dog beneath a rose-bush and weeps aloud.  \n\nSo I stitched my *Tagereise* together—prose for the road, verse for the heart-places. I let the wanderer meet a girl whose innocence is her only shield, just as Maria’s madness was hers; I let him stroke a stranger’s cheek, dry her tears, and part like a brother, because Yorick taught me that the briefest touch may weigh more than an embrace. I gave the old beggar a dead cur, so readers might remember the ass of Lyons; I set the scene at an inn where the hostess tells of a half-crazed ward, because Maria deserved a Jacques to mourn her.  \n\nThe copperplates added in ’75 were the publisher’s whim—yet I confess I smiled when the engraver drew the wanderer’s hand hovering above the girl’s tear-stained face: the moment before contact, where sentiment hovers like breath on glass. That is the instant I live for, the instant Germany had forgotten in its rush to be rational.  \n\nTonight I hear them rehearsing my prologue downstairs; the boards creak like an old man’s knees. I think: if ever an actor speaks my lines with the same tremor Yorick gave to “Dear, tender little Maria,” I shall die content. For I have not merely imitated the English parson—I have smuggled his ghost into Hamburg, dressed in a German coat, and set him walking among us, teaching that to feel keenly is the bravest journey of all.  \n\n*J. C. Bock*",
