  "gold_answer": "Roxie consulted Gov. Morock, Gov. Morock was to pick up the crumbs for Roxie, she was taught the art of penmanship by Ben Robertson, was visited by Aunt Patsy Perkins, and thought of Aunt Patsy.",
  "llm_answer": "Roxie’s relationships with the three named figures are sketched in the following ways:\n\n1. Governor Morock  \n   - Roxie, now “hopelessly destitute and penniless,” goes to the fashionable lawyer to see what can be salvaged.  \n   - Morock tells her that every suit has gone against the estate and that “Daymon should have employed me ten years ago.”  \n   - He then offers to “pick up the crumbs” for her: he believes he can secure “two or three hundred bales of cotton” left on the Simon plantations by arranging a deal through a Federal army officer.  \n   - His fee for this service is “half” the proceeds; a bale, he says, is worth four-hundred dollars.  \n   - Roxie, affecting ignorance of the details, simply instructs him to “do the best you can” and leaves the office.  Her own good sense disapproves of Morock, yet she does not break the connection.\n\n2. Ben Robertson  \n   - In the moment before she begins to write, Roxie pauses “to thank from the bottom of her heart old Ben Robertson, who in the country school had taught her the art of penmanship.”  He is remembered as the mentor who gave her the skill she is now using.\n\n3. Aunt Patsy Perkins  \n   - Aunt Patsy is a visitor in the Daymon parlor, “floating upon the surface of upper-tendom in Chicago” and renowned for fast, influential talk.  \n   - Roxie receives her courteously, offers her an easy chair, and listens while Aunt Patsy unburdens herself about the prospect of her husband’s “plain, poor” cousin Sally coming to visit.  \n   - Roxie interjects mildly, reminding Aunt Patsy that Jim is “kinsfolk on your side of the house,” prompting Aunt Patsy to defend her own kindness toward the poor relation.",
