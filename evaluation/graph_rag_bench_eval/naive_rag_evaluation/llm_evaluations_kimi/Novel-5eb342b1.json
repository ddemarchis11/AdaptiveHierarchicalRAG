  "question": "During the debates in the Lower Canada Assembly regarding the grievances against the colonial government, which prominent figure opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions that were presented as the Patriote party's demands?",
  "gold_answer": "Quesnel opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions.",
  "llm_answer": "The prominent figure who opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions was **Neilson**.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 0.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 1.0,
    "evidence_coverage": 0.0,
    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Quesnel opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions, while the Model Answer incorrectly identifies Neilson as the opponent. The retrieved context does mention Neilson as one of the members of the Patriote party who opposed the Resolutions, but the question specifically asks for the prominent figure, which the Gold Answer identifies as Quesnel. Thus, the Model Answer is incorrect in terms of correctness and evidence coverage, but it is faithful to the retrieved context."
