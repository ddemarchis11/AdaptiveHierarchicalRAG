  "question": "In 'Pen Pictures,' how is Cousin Cæsar's involvement both in military affairs and within his family relationships portrayed? Please include details about his close counsel with Cliff Carlo regarding legal matters, his service under General Price during the Civil War, and the circumstances in which he was ultimately left alone by Steve Brindle.",
  "gold_answer": "Cousin Cæsar was in close counsel with Cliff Carlo, served under Gen. Price, and was left alone by Steve Brindle.",
  "llm_answer": "Cousin Cæsar’s life is shown as a tangle of battlefield and courtroom.  \n- Family / legal side: He sits in close counsel with Cliff Carlo on the Arkansas river-bank planning how to pay the costs of the contested Simon estate; Carlo is non-committal because Roxie Daymon, a kinswoman, is involved and the Carlo family will not rush into a compromise. Cæsar, refusing to settle, says, “I have made the cast, and will stand the hazard of the die.”  \n- Military side: When the Civil War begins he enlists in General Sterling Price’s Missouri force. Early in September he is counted “No. 77” in the company roll and fights at Lexington (where Price captures Mulligan’s guns) and later at the triple-fort assault on Independence Day.  \n- The break with Steve Brindle: Steve, once his life-saving comrade, later appears in the Federal ranks. After the failed attack Cæsar, wounded and helpless on the field, calls out “S-t-e-v-e!”; Brindle and a Cherokee do pull him out of danger, but once Cæsar is safe and risen to wealth he “did not know S-t-e-v-e Brindle,” deliberately cutting the tie that had once kept him from being left alone.",
