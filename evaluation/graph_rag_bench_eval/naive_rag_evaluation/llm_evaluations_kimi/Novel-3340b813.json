  "question": "How does the novel describe the commercial activities of Fez, including its trade with other parts of Morocco and its role as a departure point for caravans to Timbuctoo, within the broader African context?",
  "gold_answer": "Fez has trade with Morocco and sends caravans to Timbuctoo.",
  "llm_answer": "The text portrays Fez as a thriving commercial hub whose activity rivals that of a European city. In its great square, Al-Kaisseriah, merchants from Europe, Africa and “the whole world” gather daily “as at a fair,” and every species of manufacture and natural product is on display. Fez serves as the fixed departure point for two major annual caravans: one bound for Central Africa/Timbuctoo and another for Mecca. The African caravan first concentrates at Tafilett and Touat before completing the ninety-day march to Timbuctoo, while the pilgrimage caravan follows the same route as far as Touat, then veers north-east via Ghadames, Fezzan and Angelah to Alexandria. These outward-bound caravans carry investments valued at about a million dollars, underlining Fez’s pivotal role in trans-Saharan and inter-continental trade networks.",
