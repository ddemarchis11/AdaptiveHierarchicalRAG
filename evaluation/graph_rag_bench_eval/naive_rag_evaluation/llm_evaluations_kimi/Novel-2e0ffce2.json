  "question": "Write a diary entry as the Parrot, describing your life with your mistress, the farewell, and being snatched away, while referencing the trouble caused to her lover.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — My days with my mistress were filled with warmth and chatter. Today, I said farewell to Corinna, her eyes glistening with sorrow. I was snatched away by envy, separated from her gentle hands. I have heard it said that my mistress is born to be a cause of trouble to her lover, and perhaps, even my loss plays a part in the tangled affairs of the heart.",
  "llm_answer": "**Diary of the Parrot**  \n*Entry: The Seventh Day*  \n\nBy the perch outside my mistress’s window, I preened my emerald feathers—each one a shard of her laughter, each curl of my tongue a mimicry of her voice. She called me *her little echo*, and I lived to repeat it back to her, a thousand times, until the words tasted of poppy and nut.  \n\nToday, the air tasted of iron. Her lover stood beneath the lattice, his cloak dripping rain or tears—I could not tell. He cried, *“Corinna, farewell!”* and I, fool bird, cried it too, louder, shriller, because it made her smile. She pressed her cheek to my cage. *“Hush, darling. He’ll think you’re mocking him.”*  \n\nI *was* mocking him. What else is a parrot for? I’d learned his groans at midnight, his stammered prayers when she denied him entry. I’d screech them back at dawn, just to watch him flinch. *Sluggish porter! Cruel doorposts!*—his own words, served in my syrupy voice, until he beat the threshold with his fists. She laughed until her shoulders shook.  \n\nBut envy has claws sharper than mine. The seventh day rose blood-red. A gust—*that stormy North wind*—ripped the latch. Wings I’d never used spasmed. As I tumbled, I saw her reach, mouth wide in a silent *no*. My tongue, traitor to the end, cried *“Corinna, farewell!”*—the lover’s phrase, now mine, now hers, now no one’s.  \n\nDarkness smelled of wet earth and copper. My feathers, once brighter than Juno’s peacock, muddied. Somewhere, the lover wept—not for me, but for the silence I’d leave in her room. *What avails it* that I pleased her? The crow survives nine ages; the parrot, one cruel gust.  \n\nIf there’s a grove beyond, let it be full of guileless birds. I’ll perch there still, repeating *“Corinna, farewell!”* until the stars themselves grow weary.  \n\n—*Etched on a tomb smaller than my body*",
