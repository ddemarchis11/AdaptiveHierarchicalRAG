  "question": "How does the narrative illustrate cycles of suggestion, interruption, and gratitude in the relationships among Mrs. Tarbox, Hiram, and Brice, as seen in Mrs. Tarbox suggesting to Mr. Brice, Hiram interrupting Mrs. Tarbox, and Brice expressing thanks to Mrs. Tarbox?",
  "gold_answer": "Mrs. Tarbox suggested to Mr. Brice, Hiram interrupted Mrs. Tarbox, and Brice thanked Mrs. Tarbox.",
  "llm_answer": "The passage shows the three-step cycle three separate times.\n\n1. Mrs. Tarbox’s suggestion – Hiram’s interruption – Brice’s thanks  \n   Mrs. Tarbox proposes that Brice “drop in … whenever ye feel like it, and Flo is at home.”  \n   Hiram at once breaks in with the self-serving reminder that he is Flo’s “second cousin,” a depositor in Brice’s bank, and that Snapshot Harry (Henry J. Dimwood) already owns shares there.  \n   Brice, having got the invitation he wanted, immediately thanks her: “Mr. Brice DID drop in frequently during the next month.”\n\n2. Mrs. Tarbox’s suggestion – Hiram’s interruption – Brice’s thanks  \n   When Brice is bewildered by the news that Flo has been sent to a convent school, Mrs. Tarbox offers to explain everything and starts to do so.  \n   Hiram cuts her short, patronizingly waving Brice toward the next room so that Mrs. Tarbox can “tell ye all this,” while he himself withdraws.  \n   Brice, grateful for the information, silently acknowledges the favour and later apologises for having misjudged them.\n\n3. Mrs. Tarbox’s suggestion – Hiram’s interruption – Brice’s thanks  \n   Reading the newspaper paragraph that names “Hiram Tarbox, Esquire,” Mrs. Tarbox exultingly tells Brice to read it aloud again.  \n   Hiram barges in, snatches the paper, and with a “fatuous grin” claims credit for the public mention.  \n   Brice, indebted to them for clearing his way to Flo, says simply, “I brought it for you,” a quiet act of gratitude that closes the cycle.",
