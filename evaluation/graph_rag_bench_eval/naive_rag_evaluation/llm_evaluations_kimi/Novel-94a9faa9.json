  "question": "Throughout Dragon's Blood, what does the recurring portrayal of Rudolph trembling in the presence of Heywood suggest about the nature of their interpersonal dynamic, and how does this reaction inform the reader about power relations or emotional tension between these two characters in various narrative situations?",
  "gold_answer": "Rudolph’s consistent trembling in Heywood’s presence suggests a persistent power imbalance or sense of intimidation, which frames the subsequent events across all chains.",
  "llm_answer": "The text never shows Rudolph “trembling” in Heywood’s presence, so the question is based on an inference the passages do not support. What the excerpts do give is a single moment when the light itself is described as “trembling,” while the men grope out from under the thatched roof. Rudolph’s own physical reaction is not mentioned. Because the narrative never repeats, or even records once, that Rudolph quivers or shakes when Heywood speaks, the device cannot be read as a “recurring” index of power or emotional tension between them. Any conclusion about their interpersonal dynamic would have to rest on evidence the supplied context simply does not contain.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the retrieved context does not support the claim of Rudolph trembling in Heywood's presence, nor does it provide evidence of a recurring portrayal of such behavior. However, the Model Answer fails to address the Gold Answer's interpretation of the interpersonal dynamic and power imbalance, which is central to the question. While the Model Answer is faithful to the context, it does not align with the Gold Answer or provide the necessary evidence to support the question's premise."
