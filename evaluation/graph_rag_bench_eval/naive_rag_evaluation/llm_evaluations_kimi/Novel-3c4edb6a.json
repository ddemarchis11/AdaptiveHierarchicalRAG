    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Elsie Maud Inglis as the founder and leader of the Scottish Women's Hospitals and mentions her involvement in Serbia in 1915. However, it misses the specific connection described in the Gold Answer, which highlights her role in sending Miss Burke to America, leading to American aid for the Scottish Women's Hospitals and their journey to Serbia. The retrieved context partially supports the Model Answer but does not explicitly confirm all details provided, such as her personal leadership in Serbia in 1915."
