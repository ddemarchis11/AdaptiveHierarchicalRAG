    "explanation": "The Model Answer partially connects David's musical practices to the harp's presence in British history by mentioning the cithara and its relation to David. However, it does not explicitly mention the lyre or kinnor, which are central to the Gold Answer. Additionally, the claim about the British cithara (cithara Anglica) is not supported by the retrieved context, making the answer unfaithful to the provided evidence."
