  "question": "How does the coke fire contribute to the revivification of bone-black within the furnace system?",
  "gold_answer": "The coke fire produces flames that heat the retorts, which are used to revivify bone-black.",
  "llm_answer": "The coke fire built in the fire-place (Y) generates flames that spread through the fire chamber, directing heat toward the bottom and then dividing into two currents that pass along the backs of the cast-iron retorts (D). These retorts, of undulating form and encased in refractory clay blocks, contain the bone-black. As the hot combustion gases travel through the lateral flues (V) and unite in the drier, they heat the retorts, facilitating the revivification of the bone-black inside.",
