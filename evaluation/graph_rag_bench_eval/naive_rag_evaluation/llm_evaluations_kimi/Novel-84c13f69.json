  "question": "Who provides meals for The Dean during his time in custody, drawing upon her past experience as the Deanery cook?",
  "gold_answer": "Hannah provides meals for The Dean.",
  "llm_answer": "Hannah, Noah Topping’s wife and former cook at the Deanery, provides the meals.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 1.0,
    "faithfulness_to_context": 0.5,
    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Hannah as the person providing meals for The Dean, aligning with the Gold Answer. However, the claim that Hannah is Noah Topping's wife and a former cook at the Deanery is not explicitly supported by the retrieved context, which reduces faithfulness. All key facts from the Gold Answer are included, so evidence coverage is complete."
