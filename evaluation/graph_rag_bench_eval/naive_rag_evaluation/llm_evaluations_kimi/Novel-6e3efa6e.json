  "question": "According to the narrative, how is the relationship between Mayab and Hindostan described, particularly in terms of their similarity and the presence of Maya in Hindostan, and how does this relate to the cultural or historical connections with the Mayas?",
  "gold_answer": "Mayab is said to have similarity with Hindostan, and Hindostan has Maya.",
  "llm_answer": "The text says that the name “Maya” and many words of the American-Maya language are found in Hindostan, and that a prince called Maya “established himself there” in remote times.  \nIt therefore treats the presence of “Maya” in Hindostan as the result of an eastward movement: a colony that started from Mayab carried its name, customs and heroes (later deified) into India. The shared traits—Maya as “mother of the gods,” the astride carrying of children, the red hand-prints on temple walls, the elephant-headed Ganeza, etc.—are explained not as Hindostan civilizing the Mayas, but as Mayas exporting their own culture eastward and, in the process, bequeathing to Hindostan the traditions that still echo the original Maya civilization of Mayab.",
