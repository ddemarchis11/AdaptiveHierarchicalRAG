    "explanation": "The Gold Answer states that Rudolph went up the wall, while the Model Answer claims he climbed onto the roof of the nunnery. The retrieved context does not provide evidence to support either claim directly, making the Model Answer unfaithful to the context. However, the Model Answer partially aligns with the Gold Answer in describing Rudolph ascending to a higher vantage point, but it introduces unsupported details about the roof."
