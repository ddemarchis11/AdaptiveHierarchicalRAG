  "question": "In the scenes where Latimer meets with the bishop to ask for Ellen's hand in marriage, how does the bishop's demeanor reveal both his confidence in Latimer and his role as a judge of Latimer's character and intentions?",
  "gold_answer": "The bishop had confidence in Latimer, spoke with him, and was judging him.",
  "llm_answer": "The bishop’s manner shifts from personal, almost paternal warmth to formal, judicial scrutiny, and this very movement shows both his prior confidence in Latimer and his present duty to test him.  \n\n1. Confidence shown  \n- He begins by admitting he “likes you very much,” reminding Latimer that he has long enjoyed his society and has heard others speak well of him.  \n- He acknowledges that Latimer’s “views and talk were good and young and fresh, and did me good,” evidence of an established trust.  \n- He even confesses that for a moment he “almost hoped that you might not be able to answer the questions,” betraying how much he would prefer not to find Latimer unworthy.  \n\n2. Shift to judge  \n- The bishop explicitly signals the change: “His manner changed, nevertheless, and Latimer saw that he was now facing a judge and not a plaintiff … and that he was in turn the defendant.”  \n- He frames the coming interrogation (“There are many things I must know … I am sure you will inform me freely”) as an unavoidable inquiry, not a casual conversation.  \n- He warns that whatever “separated you in the past … may come to an end when you are married … Can I risk that?”—a judge’s weighing of future harm.  \n- Each hypothetical possibility (the other woman dead, married, etc.) is offered to force Latimer to supply proof of irreproachable intentions.  \n\nThus, the bishop’s gentle openness at the outset demonstrates the confidence he has already placed in Latimer, while the deliberate, measured shift to pointed, searching questions reveals his conscious assumption of the role of moral judge, determined to satisfy himself of Latimer’s worthiness before granting Ellen’s hand.",
