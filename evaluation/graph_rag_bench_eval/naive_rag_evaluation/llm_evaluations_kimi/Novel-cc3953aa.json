  "question": "How does Mr. Darbey's status as an officer of the Hussars relate to his being seen by The Dean and spoken to by Sheba?",
  "gold_answer": "The Dean sees Darbey, Mr. Darbey is an officer of the Hussars, Sheba speaks to Mr. Darbey.",
  "llm_answer": "Mr. Darbey’s status as an officer of the Hussars is the reason the Dean invites him (and Major Tarver) to stay for dinner; when the Dean greets them he simply mis-names him “Mr. Garvey.” Sheba, who is present, promptly corrects the Dean—“Mr. Darbey!”—so the Dean then repeats “Darbey!” and goes on speaking to him. Thus Darbey’s commission in the regiment brings him into the house and into conversation with the Dean, with Sheba supplying his proper name.",
