  "llm_answer": "Key events shaping Suza Fairfield’s life and relationships:\n\n1. Orphaned infancy – taken in and brought up by old Aunt Katy Demitt, who moves to Port William and gives the girl both an education and a social standing.  \n2. Childhood discovery – at eleven Suza is shown Aunt Katy’s hidden hoard of five-hundred dollars in gold and silver and the foster-mother’s witnessed will that leaves “all her earthly possessions” to Suza; from that moment Suza alone knows Aunt Katy’s secrets.  \n3. Emergence as “the belle of Port William” – her beauty and accomplishments attract many suitors, yet she refuses every offer, choosing to remain in Aunt Katy’s house.  \n4. The river rescue – she pulls Don Carlo, “the hero of Shirt-Tail Bend,” from the Ohio River, an act that makes the neighborhood pair the two romantically.  \n5. Public engagement – after church one evening Don Carlo and Suza ride home together; the village soon reports that “Suza Fairfield, the belle of Port William, and Don Carlo … were engaged to be married,” sealing her social position as both belle and betrothed.",
