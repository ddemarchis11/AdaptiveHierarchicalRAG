  "question": "In the context of surveying as discussed in the text, for what purpose is the determination of latitude needed?",
  "gold_answer": "Latitude is needed for determination of true meridian.",
  "llm_answer": "In the context described, the determination of latitude is needed in order to find the azimuth of Polaris, which is essential for establishing a true meridian.",
  "scores": {
    "answer_correctness": 1.0,

    "evidence_coverage": 1.0,
    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly states that latitude is needed for establishing a true meridian, which aligns with the Gold Answer. Additionally, it provides further context by explaining that latitude is used to find the azimuth of Polaris, a step in determining the true meridian. This extra detail is relevant, supported by the retrieved context, and does not contradict the core truth of the Gold Answer."
