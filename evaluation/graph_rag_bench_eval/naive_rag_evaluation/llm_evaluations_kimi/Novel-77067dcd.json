  "question": "Which evidence establishes the connection between the harp in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript and the cymbals used by Egyptians?",
  "gold_answer": "The harp is in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript, which is in the British Museum, which has cymbals that were used by Egyptians.",
  "llm_answer": "The provided context does not establish any direct connection between the harp in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript and the cymbals used by Egyptians. The text mentions both instruments separately—describing the Anglo-Saxon harp and listing Egyptian cymbals among Hebrew instruments—but does not link them in terms of origin, influence, or shared usage. Thus, no evidence in the given material connects these two instruments.  \n\n\\boxed{No evidence in the provided context establishes a connection between the Anglo-Saxon harp and Egyptian cymbals.}",
