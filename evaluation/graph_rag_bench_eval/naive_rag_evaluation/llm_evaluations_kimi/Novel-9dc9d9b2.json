    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that Dr. Wolfred Nelson was held in Bermuda, which contradicts the Gold Answer and is not supported by the Retrieved Context. The Gold Answer specifies Montreal as the location where Nelson was held as a prisoner, and the context does not provide evidence for Bermuda being the place of imprisonment."
