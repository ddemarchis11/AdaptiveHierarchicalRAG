  "gold_answer": "By leveraging local support through colleagues and international aid via American influence, Elsie Inglis mobilized resources for the Scottish Women's Hospitals’ mission in Serbia.",
  "llm_answer": "Dr. Elsie Maud Inglis first secured local backing by persuading the Scottish Federation to adopt the Scottish Women’s Hospitals scheme in October 1914 and then sending Miss Burke—whom she had personally recruited from the London Society office—to tour and raise funds, thereby keeping the Treasury chest filled.\n\nInternationally, she exploited American sympathy by dispatching Miss Burke to the United States; Burke’s speeches so moved American audiences that they sent substantial financial aid, which was then used to equip and dispatch a complete S.W.H. unit to support the Serbian army on the Bulgarian front.",
