  "question": "How do the interactions between Rose and Brindle Bill—specifically Rose's disbelief of Brindle Bill—illustrate the roles of belief and skepticism in shaping the dynamics of their characters throughout the novel?",
  "gold_answer": "Rose did not believe Brindle Bill, illustrating the role of skepticism in their character dynamics.",
  "llm_answer": "Rose’s flat refusal to credit anything Brindle Bill says turns the two of them into the story’s living debate between belief and skepticism.  Bill’s whole power is that people *accept* his tales—once they are sworn to, the bank hands over the money.  Rose, however, treats him as a perjurer in advance: “I would not believe him on oath.”  That steadfast disbelief does not stop the swindle; Simon overrides her and lets Bill’s testimony stand.  Yet her skepticism still frames the moral compass of the episode: the money is taken on a lie that only Rose refuses to pretend is truth.  Thus, while belief (embodied by Simon and the compliant witnesses) moves the plot, Rose’s skepticism keeps the ethical score, exposing how much of the “proof” is manufactured and how much of the fortune is tainted.",
