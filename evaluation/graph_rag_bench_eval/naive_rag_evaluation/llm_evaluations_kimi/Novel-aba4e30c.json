    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly captures Heywood's mix of teasing and support towards Rudolph, which aligns with the context. However, it misses the specific detail that Heywood scoffed at Rudolph, as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the Model Answer claims Heywood is referred to as 'Heywood,' whereas the Gold Answer specifies he was called 'Maurice,' which is supported by the context. While the Model Answer provides relevant details, it does not fully align with the Gold Answer or the retrieved context."
