    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly lists the individuals who wrote letters to Sabinus, naming Penelope, Phaedra, Dido, Phyllis, Hypsipyle, and Sappho instead of Ulysses, Phaon, Hippolytus, Jason, and Demophoôn as stated in the Gold Answer. Additionally, the retrieved context does not support the claims made in the Model Answer, making it unfaithful and lacking evidence coverage."
