  "question": "How do the triplets demonstrate the diffusion of harp-related musical practices from the Middle East into Europe?",
  "gold_answer": "The kinnor, rendered as harp, is found in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript, showing a link from the Middle East (kinnor) to Europe (Anglo-Saxon manuscript).",
  "llm_answer": "The triplets trace the harp’s east-to-west movement in three steps:  \n1. Persia originated the chang harp, which Arabs adopted as the junk.  \n2. Turks, taking their music from Persia, kept the same frame-harp form; a 17th-century sketch of a Turkish woman playing it shows the instrument entering European view.  \n3. Arabs carried the harp into Spain, whence it spread to France, Germany, and England, completing the Middle-Eastern harp’s diffusion across Europe.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer provides a detailed explanation of the diffusion of harp-related musical practices but does not directly address the specific connection between the kinnor (Middle Eastern harp) and the Anglo-Saxon manuscript mentioned in the Gold Answer. While the model traces the harp's diffusion from Persia to Europe, it introduces details about the chang, junk, and Turkish harp that are partially supported by the context but not directly relevant to the Gold Answer's focus. Additionally, the connection to the Anglo-Saxon manuscript is missing, reducing evidence coverage and faithfulness."
