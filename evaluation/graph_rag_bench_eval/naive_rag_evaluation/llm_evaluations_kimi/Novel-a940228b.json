  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today was a day of sorrow. My beloved parrot, companion and confidant, was snatched away by envious fate, taken from my side. I said my farewells with heavy heart. In my grief, I called upon Isis, hoping she would turn her features to me and grant comfort. The gods are distant, yet my pain feels as if I am born to be a cause of trouble to my lover.",
  "llm_answer": "**Corinna’s Diary**  \n*Seventh day of the fasting moon, before the gates of dawn*\n\nI can scarcely hold the stylus, yet I must set down what has happened, lest memory fade with the dew.  \nMy little green echo, my feathered gossip, is gone.  He who had learned to shape my name—“Corinna”—with a tongue more nimble than any slave’s, spoke it once more as the seventh night-watch ended.  I had kept the fast of Isis, counting the critical days as the physicians bid, and on this seventh I laid the tiny cage beside my bed so his last breath might mingle with mine.  The North wind rattled the shutters like a spear on a shield; I heard the distaff of Destiny snap.  His eyes, bright as Egyptian glass, fixed on me, and from that scarlet beak came the final syllables—“Corinna… vale.”  I think he wished to comfort me, as though death were only another room into which he flew before me.\n\nI wrapped him in linen striped like the robes of Isis, knotting the cloth thrice—once for the maiden, once for the mother, once for the crone—then carried him to the garden where the myrtle shadows the wall.  There I dug a grave no longer than my forearm.  While I worked I whispered the invocation I had used in labour when I feared for my own life:  \n\n“Isis of Pharos, of Memphis, of the seven-mouthed Nile, by the sistrum that shakes the heavens, by the jackal face of Anubis who guards the threshold, by the serpent that coils around thy altar—receive this small soul.  Let the obscene birds be driven from the Elysian grove; let the Phoenix and the swan make room for my prattling lover of words.  May he range in the green meadows where guiltless creatures never know the knife.  To thee I offer these three locks of hair, three drops of milk, three pinches of spice—one for each name of the Goddess.”\n\nI pressed the miniature stone atop the earth and scratched the epitaph I had composed:  \n\n“From this very tomb I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress.  I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.”\n\nThe moon sank; the first cock crowed.  I feel hollow, yet strangely light, as if the bird had taken part of my own heart with him to prove that love can survive the tongue that once proclaimed it.  Tomorrow I shall visit the temple of Isis, clad in linen, and sit the appointed hours before her feet until the sun walks across the courtyard.  Perhaps she will send me a dream in which a green wing brushes my cheek and the word “Corinna” echoes forever.",
