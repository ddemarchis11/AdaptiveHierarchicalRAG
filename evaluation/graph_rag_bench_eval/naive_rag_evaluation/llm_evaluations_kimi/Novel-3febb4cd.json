  "question": "In the narrative's exploration of skeletal structure and childhood development, how is the spine described in terms of its composition, and what characteristics of children's bones and growth—such as the ease with which bones bend and the tendency for children to outgrow their shoes—are highlighted?",
  "gold_answer": "The spine is made of bones; bones bend easily in children, who are always out-growing shoes.",
  "llm_answer": "The spine is described as being made of twenty-four small bones, with an elastic cushion of gristle fitted between each pair. Children’s bones contain more gristle than those of older people, so they bend easily; healthy children also out-grow their shoes faster than they wear them out.",
