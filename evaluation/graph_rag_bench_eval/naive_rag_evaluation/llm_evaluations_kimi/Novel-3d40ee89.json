    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies Miss Trotter's role as the manager of the Summit House and her selection of Frida Jansen for a position, which aligns partially with the Gold Answer. However, it explicitly denies Miss Trotter's resignation, which contradicts the Gold Answer and is not clearly supported by the retrieved context. The context does not provide definitive evidence about her resignation, leaving the Model Answer partially faithful and incomplete in evidence coverage."
