    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly states that the fiddle-bow is used with the _ravanastron_, which is not supported by the context or the Gold Answer. The Gold Answer clearly states that the fiddle is played with a fiddle-bow, and the context does not provide evidence linking the fiddle-bow specifically to the _ravanastron_. The Model Answer fails to address the question correctly and is not faithful to the retrieved context."
