    "explanation": "The Model Answer correctly identifies that the book includes a section on tobacco and relates it to the treatment of its effects, as supported by the context. However, it does not explicitly name the book 'Child's Health Primer,' which is the key fact in the Gold Answer. While the Model Answer is faithful to the retrieved context, it misses the specific naming of the book, reducing evidence coverage and correctness."
