    "explanation": "The Model Answer incorrectly identifies pipes and flutes as the musical instruments used by the Aztecs, which is not consistent with the Gold Answer specifying the huehuetl and teponaztli. While the context mentions pipes and flutes, it does not support them as the primary instruments of the Aztecs, nor does it mention the huehuetl and teponaztli, leading to a failure in evidence coverage and correctness."
