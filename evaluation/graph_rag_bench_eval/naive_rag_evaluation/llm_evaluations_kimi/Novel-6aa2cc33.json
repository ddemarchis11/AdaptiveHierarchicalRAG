  "question": "How does the narrative chain connect Cornwall's legendary expression to Arthur and his associates, particularly through Arthur's relationship with Sir Bedevere and the pivotal event of Excalibur being thrown away?",
  "gold_answer": "Cornwall is said to find its legendary expression in Arthur, who is connected to Sir Bedivere and pivotal events like the throwing of Excalibur, tying the region's narrative identity to Arthurian legend.",
  "llm_answer": "The narrative chain links Cornwall’s legendary expression to Arthur and his knights by anchoring the whole cycle of stories in a local Cornish landscape. Arthur’s last act—commanding Sir Bedivere (the “bold Sir Bedivere” of Tennyson) to throw Excalibur into Dozmare Pool—takes place on Bodmin Moor. That single, poignant scene, re-told in the “Idylls of the King,” fuses the king, the faithful knight and the sword into a living Cornish legend: the arm rising from the water to catch the blade fixes the moment in local memory and makes Bedivere’s obedience the final proof of fealty. Because the pool, the moor and the neighbouring town can still be pointed out, the story is not just read but visited; the landscape itself becomes the enduring expression of Arthurian loyalty and loss, passed on by Cornish folk who still show the spot “where Arthur gave his sword to the lake.”",
