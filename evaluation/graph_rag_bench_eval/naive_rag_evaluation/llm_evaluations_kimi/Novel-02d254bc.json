  "question": "How was Aunt Patsy Perkins's ability to communicate and her conversational style described in the narrative, especially in relation to her social interactions in Chicago and her remarks to Mrs. Daymon?",
  "gold_answer": "Aunt Patsy Perkins could talk faster and more than any woman west of the Alleghany Mountains.",
  "llm_answer": "Aunt Patsy is portrayed as an exceptionally fast, fluent, and forceful talker. The narrative says she “could talk faster and more of it than any woman west of the Alleghany Mountains,” and the ladies of Chicago’s upper circles willingly took her advice. In conversation with Mrs. Daymon she speaks in vivid, emphatic bursts—comparing her hatred of Perkins’s “dratted poor kin” to the difference between two white beans on a fence, vowing that she will “make it hot for old Perkins,” and declaring, “A woman has nothing but her tongue, and while I live I will use mine.”",
