  "gold_answer": "The Mayas had many customs and attainments identical to those of the Egyptians, were compared to the Egyptians, and had relations with Asiatic peninsulas.",
  "llm_answer": "Augustus Le Plongeon’s *Vestiges of the Mayas* presents several lines of evidence and comparison regarding connections between the Mayas and the Egyptians, as well as relationships with civilizations of the Asiatic peninsulas:\n\n### **Connections Between the Mayas and the Egyptians:**\n1. **Cultural and Religious Similarities**: Le Plongeon notes that many customs and attainments of the Egyptians were identical to those of the Mayas. However, he also emphasizes that the Mayas had religious rites and habits unknown to the Egyptians.\n2. **Directional Ancestral Beliefs**: The Egyptians are said to have always pointed to the West as the birthplace of their ancestors and worshipped gods and goddesses whose remains are still in *Mayab* (the Maya region).\n3. **Monumental Evidence**: Le Plongeon argues that the monuments themselves indicate the respective antiquity of the two nations, suggesting that the Maya civilization may be older than the Egyptian.\n\n### **Relationships with Civilizations of the Asiatic Peninsulas:**\n1. **Limited Commonalities**: Le Plongeon states that the religious lores and customs shared between the Mayas and the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas are too few to support the idea that the Mayas received their civilization from them.\n2. **Evidence of Contact, Not Origin**: Instead, these shared elements suggest that relations existed at some point, with an interchange of habits and beliefs—similar to what happens between modern civilized nations.\n3. **Physical Evidence in Art and Sculpture**:\n   - The figures sculpted on the obelisks of Copan show a discernible Asiatic type.\n   - Conversely, the features of statues in Hindostan’s temples are unmistakably American.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nLe Plongeon does **not** support the theory that the Maya received their civilization from Egypt or Asia Minor. Instead, he presents evidence of **cultural exchanges** and **ancient contacts**, while asserting the **antiquity and originality** of Maya civilization.",
