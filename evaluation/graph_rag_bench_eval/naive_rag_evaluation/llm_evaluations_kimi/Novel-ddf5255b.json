  "question": "How did Papineau's actions during the period leading up to and following the Ninety-Two Resolutions affect his relationship with John Neilson, including Neilson's opposition to the resolutions, his eventual break with Papineau, and his alignment with Augustin Cuvillier?",
  "gold_answer": "Papineau's actions alienated John Neilson, who opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions and broke with Papineau, following the lead of Augustin Cuvillier.",
  "llm_answer": "Papineau’s increasingly radical course—especially his push for the Ninety-Two Resolutions—drove John Neilson into open opposition. Neilson objected to the expulsion of Mondelet, opposed Bourdages’s resolutions to abolish the Legislative Council, and publicly rebuked Papineau for intemperate language. When the Ninety-Two Resolutions came to a vote, Neilson (with Cuvillier, Quesnel and Stuart) went into the minority against them, formally breaking with Papineau. Thereafter Neilson and Cuvillier acted together: both were defeated in the general election that followed, and both were thereafter counted among the “Mugwump” seceders no longer within Papineau’s party.",

    "explanation": "The Model Answer accurately captures the essence of the Gold Answer, detailing how Papineau's actions alienated Neilson, leading to his opposition to the Ninety-Two Resolutions and eventual break with Papineau. It also correctly mentions Neilson's alignment with Cuvillier, supported by the retrieved context. The additional details provided, such as Neilson's objections to specific actions and the election outcomes, are relevant, grounded in the context, and enhance the explanation without deviating from the core truth."
