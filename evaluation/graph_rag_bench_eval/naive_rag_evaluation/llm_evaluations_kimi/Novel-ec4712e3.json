  "question": "In what way did the storm affect the journey of the coach along the mountain road, considering the storm's fury spent on the mountain and the incident where the coach ran upon the pole-straps of the arrested horses?",
  "gold_answer": "The storm spent its fury on the mountain, and the coach ran upon the pole-straps.",
  "llm_answer": "The storm made the mountain road so treacherous that the coach could only crawl downward in near-darkness, its leather roof flexing like an umbrella as snow and wind battered it. Once the storm’s fury had been left higher up the mountain, the coach finally gained speed on the descending terrace, but it was still moving cautiously when it jolted to a halt after striking the taut pole-straps of the now-stopped horses—an incident that occurred only after the worst of the weather had passed.",
