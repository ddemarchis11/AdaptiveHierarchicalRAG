  "question": "What is the significance of the pentatonic scale in different musical traditions, such as its use in Scotch national dances, its adoption in Chinese musical instruments, and its presence in the intervals produced by the Peruvian syrinx?",
  "gold_answer": "The pentatonic scale is used in Scotch national dances, is adopted by Chinese instruments, and is produced by the Peruvian syrinx.",
  "llm_answer": "The pentatonic scale is significant across these traditions because it appears as the deliberate structural basis for their music: Scotch national dances derive their most conspicuous characteristics from the exclusive use of pentatonic intervals; ancient Chinese instruments were constructed to produce only those intervals; and the Peruvian syrinx was purposely built so that its pipes yield no other than the pentatonic set of tones.",
