  "question": "In the chapter where Trost discusses technological advancement, how does the text describe the relationship between the human organism and the machine, especially with regard to the idea that the machine is an extension of the human organism?",
  "gold_answer": "The machine is described as an extension of the human organism.",
  "llm_answer": "The text describes the machine as “simply extensions of the human organism, so to speak, limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more subtle finger-tips.” It stresses that these “wonder-workers” remain subordinate: they “need our tendance and regulation, obey the mandates of our consciousness,” and “depend upon us.” Thus, the machine is portrayed as an amplified, yet always dependent, part of the human body rather than a rival or replacement.",
