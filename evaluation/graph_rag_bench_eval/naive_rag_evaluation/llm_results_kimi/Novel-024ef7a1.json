You have learned about the twenty-four little bones in the spine, and the ribs that curve around from the spine to the front, or breast-bone. These bones, with the shoulder-blades and the collar-bones, form a bony case or box. In it are some of the most useful organs of the body. This box is divided across the middle by a strong muscle, so that we may say it is two stories high. The upper room is called the chest; the lower one, the abdomen ([)a]b d[=o]'m[)e]n). In the chest, are the heart and the lungs. In the abdomen, are the stomach, the liver, and some other organs. THE STOMACH. The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful a bag as could be made, you will say, when I tell you what it can do. The outside is made of muscles; the lining prepares a juice called gastric (g[)a]s'tr[)i]k) juice, and keeps it always ready for use. Now, what would you think if a man could put into a bag, beef, and apples, and potatoes, and bread and milk, and sugar, and salt, tie up the bag and lay it away on a shelf",
