  "question": "What is the close personal relationship between Miss Piney Tibbs and Cissy Trixit as depicted in the social scenes of Canada City?",
  "gold_answer": "Miss Piney Tibbs is the bosom friend of Cissy Trixit.",
  "llm_answer": "Miss Piney Tibbs and Cissy Trixit are described as “bosom friends,” with Cissy acting as Piney’s social patron. In Canada City’s hierarchy, Cissy—daughter of the town’s leading banker—ranks far above Piney, whose father merely keeps the hotel. Their relationship is thus one of intimate friendship in which Cissy is the acknowledged superior and Piney her grateful protégée.",

What kep' ye?\" \"How does it look?\" responded Cissy, as a relevant reply. The \"it\" referred to Cissy's new hat, and to the young girl the coherence was perfectly plain. Miss Tibbs looked at \"it\" severely. It would not do for a protegee to be too complaisant. \"Hem! Must have cost a heap o' money.\" \"It did! Came from the best milliner in San Francisco.\" \"Of course,\" said Piney, with half assumed envy. \"When your popper runs the bank and just wallows in gold!\" \"Never mind, dear,\" replied Cissy cheerfully. \"So'll YOUR popper some day. I'm goin' to get mine to let YOUR popper into something--Ditch stocks and such. Yes! True, O King! Popper'll do anything for me,\" she added a little loftily. Loyal as Piney was to her friend, she was by no means convinced of this. She knew the difference between the two men, and had a vivid recollection of hearing her own father express his opinion of Cissy's respected parent as a \"Gold Shark\" and \"Quartz Miner Crusher.\" It did not,",

Nevertheless, she was somewhat consoled by the ravishing effect of the bowknot she had just tied, and turned away not wholly dissatisfied. Indeed, as the acknowledged belle of Canada City and the daughter of its principal banker, small wonder that a certain frank vanity and childlike imperiousness were among her faults--and her attractions. She bounded down the stairs and into the front parlor, for their house possessed the unheard-of luxury of a double drawing-room, albeit the second apartment contained a desk, and was occasionally used by Cissy's father in private business interviews with anxious seekers of \"advances\" who shunned the publicity of the bank. Here she instantly flew into the arms of her bosom friend, Miss Piney Tibbs, a girl only a shade or two less pretty than herself, who, always more or less ill at ease in these splendors, was awaiting her impatiently. For Miss Tibbs was merely the daughter of the hotel-keeper; and although Tibbs was a Southerner, and had owned \"his own <DW65>s\" in the States, she was of inferior position and a protegee of Cissy's. \"Thank goodness you've come,\" exclaimed Miss",

Indeed, Mr. Windibrook was told that he had declared that the prosperity of Canada City was only a mushroom growth, and it seems too shocking to repeat, dear, but they say he said that the new church--OUR church--was simply using the Almighty as a big bluff to the other towns. Of course, Mr. Windibrook couldn't see him after that. Why, he even said your father ought to send you to school somewhere, and not let you grow up in this half civilized place.\" Strangely enough, Cissy did not hail this corroboration of her dislike to young Masterton with the liveliness one might have expected. Perhaps it was because Piney Tibbs was no longer present, having left Cissy at the parsonage and returned home. Still she enjoyed her visit after a fashion, romped with the younger",

Following her friend down the steps of the veranda, they passed into the staring graveled walk of the new garden, only recently recovered from the wild wood, its accurate diamond and heart shaped beds of vivid green set in white quartz borders giving it the appearance of elaborately iced confectionery. A few steps further brought them to the road and the wooden \"sidewalk\" to Main Street, which carried civic improvements to the hillside, and Mr. Trixit's very door. Turning down this thoroughfare, they stopped laughing, and otherwise assumed a conscious half artificial air; for it was the hour when Canada City lounged listlessly before its shops, its saloons, its offices and mills, or even held lazy meetings in the dust of the roadway, and the passage down the principal street of its two prettiest girls was an event to be viewed as if it were a civic procession. Hats flew off as they passed; place was freely given; impeding barrels and sacks were removed from the wooden pavement, and preoccupied indwellers hastily summoned to the front door to do homage to Cissy Trixit and Piney as they went by. Not but that Canada City, in the fierce and unregenerate days of its youth, had seen fairer and higher <DW52> faces, more gayly bedizened, on its thoroughfares, but never anything so fresh and innocent.",

A ring at the front doorbell startled her; without waiting for the servant to answer it, she stepped out on the veranda, and saw a boy whom she recognized as a waiter at the hotel kept by Piney's father. He was holding a note in his hand, and staring intently at the house and garden. Seeing Cissy, he transferred his stare to her. Snatching the note from him, she tore it open, and read in Piney's well-known scrawl, \"Dad won't let me come to you now, dear, but I'll try to slip out late to-night.\" Why should she want to come? She had said nothing about coming NOW--and why should her father prevent her? Cissy crushed the note between her fingers, and faced the boy. \"What are you staring at--idiot?\" The boy grinned hysterically, a little frightened at Cissy's straightened brows and snapping eyes. \"Get away! there's no answer.\" The boy ran off, and Cissy returned to the drawing-room. Then it occurred to her that the servant had not answered the bell. She rang again furiously. There was no response. She called down the basement staircase, and heard only the echo of her voice in the depths. How still the house",
