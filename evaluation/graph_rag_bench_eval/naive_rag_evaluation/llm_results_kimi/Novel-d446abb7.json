  "question": "Imagine you are the Duke of Wellington. Write a diary entry about your efforts to emancipate the Catholics and your thoughts on the Irish and English relations.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — Today I continued my advocacy for Catholic emancipation. I am aware that the Catholics of this era know the necessity of modesty, especially considering their Irish heritage. There is a sentiment in high places that the Irish have been too lenient toward the English, and yet, England itself is a nation with a sense of common descent and unity. My hope is that these reforms will foster greater harmony across all these groups.",
  "llm_answer": "Wellington’s Private Journal  \nHorse Guards, 5 April 1829, 11 o’clock at night\n\nI have this day carried the third reading of the Relief Bill through the Lords by a majority of 105.  My hand still shakes, less from the fatigue of three nights’ debate than from the recollection of the faces that confronted me from the Tory benches—men who, under the old Penal code, would have hailed me as the champion of Protestant ascendancy, and who now looked on me as little better than a Papist incendiary.  I took no pleasure in their discomfiture; I have seen too many fields of real battle to relish a civil war of words.  Yet I would rather face Soult’s columns again than the hatred I encountered this week from my own countrymen.\n\nThe Irish question is not, as the country squires pretend, a question of theology; it is a question of property and of fear.  For two centuries we told the Irish that to be loyal they must first cease to be Irish; we set their religion up as a mark of disaffection, and then complained that they were disaffected.  I have known Catholic gentlemen in Kerry who could recite the penal statutes by heart, yet who fought under my colours in the Peninsula with a courage no Englishman could surpass.  Their loyalty was personal, not statutory; and I have ever held that a loyalty which must be enforced by the gallows is not worth the rope.\n\nThe Bill I have forced through Parliament does no more than restore to Roman Catholics the common rights of subjects; yet to hear the speeches of the ultras one would suppose we had handed St. Paul’s over to the Pope.  I told the Lords to-night that if they rejected the measure they would not long be called upon to debate it, for Ireland would debate it for them with pike and torch.  I spoke with the memory of 1798 still raw in my nostrils.  They credit me with foresight; it is only memory.\n\nAs for myself, I have been taxed with apostasy.  They forget that in 1809 I stood on the ridge of Talavera and saw Irish muskets hold the French at bay; that at Waterloo the 27th (Inniskillings) died in square rather than yield; that for every English regiment that broke, an Irish one stood fast.  I have never asked a man in the field what he believed of the Real Presence; I asked only that he stand.  It is the same in civil life.  Give a man security for his conscience and he will give you security for his estate; deny him both and you teach him that he has nothing to lose.\n\nYet I am no romantic.  The Irish are not angels, nor are the English devils.  I have seen too much of both races to believe in the exclusive virtue of either.  The Irish peasant is patient, witty, improvident; the English squire is sturdy, prejudiced, and just after his fashion.  The misfortune is that our institutions were framed to fit the squire and to fetter the peasant.  I have removed one fetter to-day; the rest must follow, or the iron will enter the soul of both islands.\n\nI think of my father’s Ireland—of the country I knew as a boy in County Meath, where the chapel at Dangan had to be roofed with straw lest the yeomanry take offence at a steeple.  I remember the priest saying Mass while a lookout watched from the hill for the approach of the dragoons.  Those days are ended, if the King will but sign.  Yet I know that emancipation is only the first breach in the wall; behind it lies the wider question of the land, the Church, the whole fabric of a society built upon conquest.  I shall not live to see that fabric altered; but I have made a beginning, and I have done it without firing a musket.\n\nTo-morrow I must ride to the Palace and advise His Majesty to give the Royal Assent.  I have been warned that the King hesitates, that he fears for his coronation oath.  I shall remind him that the crown he wears was secured by the same Parliament which now advises him, and that the safety of the crown lies not in the exclusion of the subject but in the justice of the sovereign.  If he refuses, I shall lay my commission at his feet; I will not govern against the only principle which makes government possible—the confidence of the governed.\n\nMidnight strikes.  The town is quiet, yet I seem to hear the echo of the division bell still ringing in the stone corridors.  It is the knell of an old ascendancy, and perhaps—though I dare not hope—the birth-note of a new nationality.  I have spent my life in keeping empires intact; to-night I have risked the dissolution of my own party to keep the United Kingdom itself from dissolution.  Posterity will call it statesmanship or treachery, according as it succeeds or fails.  I call it necessity.\n\nA.E.W.",

I gathered that our national troubles in the first two decades of this century were not at all due to the mistakes of our administrators; and that England, with its fine Church and Constitution, would have been exceedingly well off if every British subject had been thankful for what was provided, and had minded his own business--if, for example, numerous Catholics of that period had been aware how very modest they ought to be considering they were Irish. The times, I heard, had often been bad; but I was constantly hearing of \"bad times\" as a name for actual evenings and mornings when the godfathers who gave them that name appeared to me remarkably comfortable. Altogether, my father's England seemed to me lovable, laudable, full of good men, and having good rulers, from Mr Pitt on to the Duke of Wellington, until he was for emancipating the Catholics; and it was so far from prosaic to me that I looked into it for a more exciting romance than such as I could find in my own adventures, which consisted mainly in fancied crises calling for the resolute wielding of domestic swords and firearms against unapparent robbers, rioters, and invaders who, it seemed, in my father's prime had more chance of being real.
