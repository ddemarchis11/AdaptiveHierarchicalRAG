In this, as in many other things, we are to some extent in the position of a dwarf on the shoulders of a giant; the dwarf may, indeed, see further than the giant; but he remains a dwarf, and the giant a giant. The question has been much discussed as to what the original food of man was, and some people have made it a subject of excited contention. The most reasonable conclusion is that man is naturally a frugivorous or fruit-eating animal, like his cousins the monkeys, whom he still so much resembles. This forms a further argument in favor of his being originated in warm regions, where fruits of all kinds were plentiful. It is pretty clear that the resort to animal food, whether the result of the pressure of want from failure of vegetable products, or a mere taste and a desire for change and more appetizing food, is one that took place many ages ago, probably in the earliest anthropoid, if not in the latest pithecoid stage. No doubt some advantage was recognized in the more rapid digestion and the comparative ease with which the hunter or fisher could obtain food, instead of waiting for the ripening of fruits in countries which had more or less prolonged periods of cold and inclement weather. Some anatomical changes have",

In other ways, also, which it would take too long to tell you here, doctors have learned how these magical food-bags take care of our food. WHY DOES THE FOOD NEED TO BE CHANGED? Your mamma tells you sometimes at breakfast that you must eat oat-meal and milk to make you grow into a big man or woman. Did you ever wonder what part of you is made of oat-meal, or what part of milk? That stout little arm does not look like oat-meal; those rosy cheeks do not look like milk. If our food is to make stout arms and rosy cheeks, strong bodies and busy brains, it must first be changed into a form in which it can get to each part and feed it. When the food in the stomach is mixed and prepared, it is ready to be sent through the body; some is carried to the bones, some to the muscles, some to the nerves and brain, some to the skin, and some even to the finger nails, the hair, and the eyes. Each part needs to be fed in order to grow. WHY DO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GROWING NEED FOOD? Children need each day to make larger and larger bones, larger muscles, and a larger skin to cover the larger body. Every day, each part is also wearing out a little, and needing",
