  "question": "How do the triplets demonstrate the interplay between local rulers—such as the Emperor residing at Mequinez and the Sultan in Salee—and foreign influences, as seen through historical events like England's occupation of Tangier, the French bombardment of Mogador, and the Portuguese destruction of Anfa, thereby highlighting the regions' internal governance and external challenges?",
  "gold_answer": "Local rulers such as the Emperor and Sultan govern regions, but their domains have experienced foreign actions like the English occupation of Tangier, French bombardment of Mogador, and Portuguese destruction of Anfa, showing both internal authority and external challenges.",
  "llm_answer": "The triplets show that local rulers—the Emperor at Mequinez and the Sultan in Salee—constantly balanced their own authority against the pressure of foreign powers.  \nEngland’s earlier occupation of Tangier, the French bombardment of Mogador, and the earlier Portuguese destruction of Anfa each exposed the limits of that authority: when a European fleet appeared, the Moroccan governors either fled (as at Mogador) or were forced to negotiate from a position of weakness.  \nAt the same time, the rulers tried to re-assert control by turning on their own subjects—refusing to let the British Consul leave Mogador, ordering Jews to resume distinctive dress, or allowing tribal levies to plunder the Jewish quarter—thereby shifting the cost of external defeat onto internal groups.  \nThus the triplets reveal a recurring pattern: foreign military action exposes the fragility of central governance, and the local court responds by tightening internal controls and sacrificing scapegoat communities, illustrating how external challenges repeatedly reshape, but never fully erase, the internal apparatus of Moroccan rule.",

Hearing that the Jews of Tangier, on returning from Gibraltar, would often adopt the European dress, and so, by disguising themselves, be treated like Christians and Europeans, he ordered all these would-be Europeans forthwith to be undressed, and to resume their black turban. Alas, how were all these Passover, Tabernacle and wedding festivals, these happy and joyous days of the Jewish society of Mogador, changed on the bombardment of that city! What became of the rich and powerful merchants, the imperial vassals of commerce with their gorgeous wives bending under the weight of diamonds, pearls, and precious gems, during that sad and unexpected period? The newspapers of the day recorded the melancholy story. Many of the Jews were massacred, or buried underneath the ruins of the city; their wives subjected to plunder; the rest were left wandering naked and starving on the desolate sandy coast of the Atlantic, or hidden in the mountains, obtaining a momentary respite from the rapacious fury of the savage Berbers and Arabs. It is well known that, while the French bombarded Tangier and Mogador from without, the Berber and Arab tribes, aided by the _canaille_ of the Moors, plundered the city from within. Several of the Moorish rabble",

The batteries were silenced, and the Moorish authorities with many of the inhabitants fled, leaving the city unprotected against the wild tribes, who this evening and the next morning, sacked and fired the city. On the 16th, nine hundred French were landed on the isle of Mogador. After a rude encounter with the garrison, they took possession of it and its forts. Their loss was, after twenty-eight hours' bombarding, trifling, some twenty killed and as many more wounded; the Moors lost some five hundred on the isle killed, besides the casualties in the city. The British Consul and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, with others, were obliged to remain in the town during the bombardment on account of their liabilities to the Emperor. The escape of these people from destruction was most miraculous. The bombarding squadron reached on the 10th, the English frigate, 'Warspite,' on the",

The Governor and his troops, about sunset, disgracefully and precipitately fled, followed by nearly all the Moorish population, thereby abandoning Mogador to pillage, and the European Jews to the merciless wild tribes, who, though levied to defend the town, had, for some hours past, hovered round it like droves of famished wolves. As the Governor fled out, terrified as much at the wild tribes as of the French, in rushed these hordes, led on by their desperate chiefs. These wretches undismayed, unmoved by the terrors of the bombarding ravages around, strove and vied with each other in the committal of every act of the most unlicensed ferocity and depredation, breaking open houses, assaulting the inmates, murdering such as shewed resistance, denuding the more submissive of their clothing, abusing women--particularly in the Jewish quarter--to all which atrocities the Europeans were likewise exposed. At the most imminent hazard of their lives, the British Consul and his wife, with a few others, escaped from these ruffians. Truly providential was their flight through streets, resounding with the most turbulent confusion and sanguinary violence. It was",

If the English subject be guilty, he shall not be punished with more severity than a Moor would be; should he escape, no other subject of the English nation shall be arrested in his stead, and if the escape be made after the decision, in order to avoid punishment, he shall be sentenced as a Moor would be who had committed the same crime. Should any dispute occur in the English territories, between a Moor and an English subject, it shall be decided by an equal number of the Moors residing there and of Christians, according to the custom of the place, if not contrary to the Moorish law.\" In the amended clause of Article VIII. We have for any complaint, substituted serious personal injury, and I cannot but observe that the making of the Emperor the final judge, in such case, is a stretch of too great confidence in Moorish justice. Not that a Sultan of Morocco is necessarily bad or worse than an European Sovereign, but because a personage of such power and character, armed with unbounded attributes of despotism over his own subjects, who are considered his Abeed, or slaves, whilst feebly aided by the perception of the common rights of men, and imperfectly acquainted with European civilization, can never, unless, indeed by accident or miracle, justly decide upon the case of an Englishman, or upon a dispute between his own and a foreign subject; for",

The Governor even peremptorily refused permission for the wife of the Consul to leave, upon the cruel sophism that, \"The Christian religion asserts the husband and wife to be one, consequently,\" added the Governor, \"as it is my duty, which I owe to my Emperor, to prevent the Consul from leaving Mogador, I must also keep his wife.\" The fact is the Moors, in their stupidity, and perhaps in their revenge, thought the retaining of the British Consul and the Europeans might, in some way or other, contribute to the defence of themselves, save the city, or mitigate the havoc of the bombardment. At any rate, they would say, \"Let the Christians share the same fate and dangers as ourselves.\" During the bombardment, the Moors for two hours fought well, but their best gunner, a Spanish",
