She listened, with exclamations of pity and concern, to Cracker's account of the poor old hermit, and agreed with Bruin that aid must be sent to him without delay. \"I will pack a basket at once,\" she said, \"with nourishing food, bandages for the broken leg, and some simple medicines; and Toto, you will take it to the poor man, will you not, dear?\" \"Of course I will!\" said Toto, heartily. But Bruin said: \"No, dear Madam! I will go myself. Our Toto's heart is big, but he is not strong enough to take care of a sick person. It is surely best for me to go.\" The grandmother hesitated. \"Dear Bruin,\" she said, \"of course you _would_ be the best nurse on many accounts; but if the man is weak and nervous, I am afraid--you alarmed him once, you know, and possibly the sight of you, coming in suddenly, might--\" \"Speak out, Granny!\" cried Toto, laughing. \"You think Bruin would simply frighten the man to death, or at best into a fit; and you are quite right. I'll tell you what, old fellow!\" he added, turning to Bruin, who looked sadly crestfallen at this throwing of cold",

Now, I confess I do not see _how_ a pig's tail could be worn on the head, or how it could be unbraided; that is, if the Chinese pigs have tails like that of our friend in the sty yonder.\" Toto laughed aloud at this, and even the grandmother could not help smiling a very little; but she gently told Bruin what a Chinaman's pig-tail was, and how he wore it. Meantime, Miss Mary, the parrot, looked on with an air of dignified amusement. \"My respected father,\" she",

You never were anything but a boy, were you?\" \"Oh, no, of course not!\" said Toto. \"But that is different. When Granny was young, she was a girl, you see.\" \"I don't believe it!\" said the bear, stoutly. \"I--do--_not_--believe it! I saw a girl once--many years ago; it squinted, and its hair was frowzy, and it wore a hideous basket of flowers on its head,--a dreadful creature! Madam never can have looked like _that_!\" At this moment a knock was heard at the door. Toto flew to open it, and with a beaming face ushered in the old hermit, who entered leaning on his stick, with his crow perched on one shoulder and the hawk on the other. Then, what greetings followed! What introductions! What bows and courtesies, and whisking of tails and flapping of wings! The hermit's bow in greeting to the old lady was so stately that Master <DW53> was consumed with a desire to imitate it; and in so doing, he",

I don't remember what I did with it. Oh, yes, I do, though!\" he added hastily. \"It is there, on that chair. Bruin! Bruin, I say! mind what you are about. It is just behind you.\" Thus adjured, the good bear, who had been gravely revolving by himself in the corner until he was quite blind, tried to stop short; at the same instant the squirrel and the parrot, stumbling against his shaggy paw, fell over it in a confused heap of feathers and fur. He stepped hastily back to avoid treading on them, lost his balance, and sat down heavily--on the custard pie! At the crash of the platter, the squirrel released Miss Mary, who flew screaming to her perch; the grandmother wrung her hands and lamented, begging to be told what had happened, and who was hurt; and the unfortunate Bruin, staggering to his feet, stared aghast at the ruin he had wrought. It was a very complete ruin, certainly, for the platter was in small fragments, while most of its contents were clinging to his own shaggy black coat. \"Well, old fellow,\" said",

Snowing fast outside, is isn't it, Bruin?\" \"Yes!\" replied the bear. \"That makes it all the more jolly inside!\" said the squirrel. \"What are we to do this evening? Is it a story evening, or dancing-school and games?\" \"We had dancing-school last night,\" said the bear. \"I haven't got over it yet. I backed into the fire twice in 'forward and back, and cross over.' Let us have a story to-night.\" \"Yes!\" said the grandmother. \"It is just the night for a story; and if you wish it, I will tell you one myself.\" \"Oh! please, Madam!\" \"Thank you, Madam!\" \"Hurrah! Granny!\" resounded on all sides, for the grandmother's stories were very popular; so, settling herself back in her chair, and beginning a new row in her knitting, the good woman said:-- \"This story was told to me by my own grandmother.
