Some bacon and eggs and green things and coffee.\" VAN BIBBER AS BEST MAN Young Van Bibber came up to town in June from Newport to see his lawyer about the preparation of some papers that needed his signature. He found the city very hot and close, and as dreary and as empty as a house that has been shut up for some time while its usual occupants are away in the country. As he had to wait over for an afternoon train, and as he was down town, he decided to lunch at a French restaurant near Washington Square, where some one had told him you could get particular things particularly well cooked. The tables were set on a terrace with plants and flowers about them, and covered with a tricolored awning. There were no jangling horse-car bells nor dust to disturb him, and almost all the other tables were unoccupied. The waiters leaned against these tables and chatted in a French argot; and a cool breeze blew through the plants and billowed the awning, so that, on the whole, Van Bibber was glad he had come. There was, beside himself, an old Frenchman scolding over his late",

There was, beside himself, an old Frenchman scolding over his late breakfast; two young artists with Van <DW18> beards, who ordered the most remarkable things in the same French argot that the waiters spoke; and a young lady and a young gentleman at the table next to his own. The young man's back was toward him, and he could only see the girl when the youth moved to one side. She was very young and very pretty, and she seemed in a most excited state of mind from the tip of her wide-brimmed, pointed French hat to the points of her patent-leather ties. She was strikingly well-bred in appearance, and Van Bibber wondered why she should be dining alone with so young a man. \"It wasn't my fault,\" he heard the youth say earnestly. \"How could I know he would be out of town? and anyway it really doesn't matter. Your cousin is not the only clergyman in the city.\" \"Of course not,\" said the girl, almost tearfully, \"but they're not my cousins and he is, and that would have made it so much, oh, so very much different. I'm awfully frightened!\" \"Runaway couple,\" commented Van Bibber. \"Most interesting. Read about 'em often; never seen 'em. Most interesting.\" He bent his head over an entree,",

I have your pistol, you know.\" The man placed the bags inside the kitchen door; and, with a doubtful look at his custodian, stepped out into the street, and walked, as he was directed to do, toward the Grand Central station. Van Bibber kept just behind him, and kept turning the question over in his mind as to what he ought to do. He felt very guilty as he passed each policeman, but he recovered himself when he thought of the wife and child who lived in the West, and who were \"straight.\" \"Where to?\" asked Van Bibber, as he stood at the ticket-office window. \"Helena, Montana,\" answered the man with, for the first time, a look of relief. Van Bibber bought the ticket and handed it to the burglar. \"I suppose you know,\" he said, \"that you can sell that at a place down town for half the money.\" \"Yes, I know that,\" said the burglar. There was a half-hour before the train left, and Van Bibber took his charge into the restaurant and watched him eat everything placed before him, with his eyes glancing all the while to the right or left. Then Van Bibber gave him some money and told him to write to him, and",

He stepped out of the boat eagerly and helped out the girl with long hair as though she had been a princess and tipped the rude young man who had laughed at him, but who was perspiring now with the work he had done; and then as he turned to leave the dock he came face to face with A Girl He Knew and Her brother. Her brother said, \"How're you, Van Bibber? Been taking a trip around the world in eighty minutes?\" And added in a low voice, \"Introduce me to your young lady friends from Hester Street.\" \"Ah, how're you--quite a surprise!\" gasped Van Bibber, while his late guests stared admiringly at the pretty young lady in the riding-habit, and utterly refused to move on. \"Been taking ride on the lake,\" stammered Van Bibber; \"most exhilarating. Young friends of mine--these young ladies never rode on lake, so I took 'em. Did you see me?\" \"Oh, yes, we saw you,\" said Her brother, dryly, while she only smiled at him, but so kindly and with such perfect understanding that Van Bibber grew red with pleasure and bought three long strings of tickets for the swans at some absurd discount, and gave each little girl a string. \"There,\" said Her brother to the little ladies from Hester Street, \"now you can take",

The girl saw nothing of this mutual recognition, for she was looking with startled eyes at a hansom that had dashed up the side street and was turning the corner. \"Ted, O Ted!\" she gasped. \"It's your brother. There! In that hansom. I saw him perfectly plainly. Oh, how did he find us? What shall we do?\" Ted grew very red and then very white. \"Standish,\" said Van Bibber, jumping up and reaching for his hat, \"pay this chap for these things, will you, and I'll get rid of your brother.\" Van Bibber descended the steps lighting a cigar as the elder Standish came up them on a jump. \"Hello, Standish!\" shouted the New Yorker. \"Wait a minute; where are you going? Why, it seems to rain Standishes to-day! First see your brother; then I see you. What's on?\" \"You've seen him?\" cried the Boston man, eagerly. \"Yes, and where is he? Was she with him? Are they married? Am I in time?\" Van Bibber answered these different questions to the effect that he had seen young Standish and Mrs. Standish not a half an hour before, and that they were just then taking a cab for Jersey City, whence they were to depart for Chicago. \"The driver",
