Yuba Bill swallowed the glass of whiskey at a gulp, wiped his mouth and eyes, smothered a second explosion, and then gravely confronted Brice. \"When do you think it was taken, and how?\" \"It must have been taken when I left the coach on the road and went over to that settler's cabin,\" said Brice bitterly. \"Yet I believed everything was safe, and I left two men--both passengers--one inside and one on the box, that man who sat the other side of you.\" \"Jee whillikins!\" ejaculated Bill, with his hand to his forehead, \"the men I clean forgot to pick up in the road, and now I reckon they never intended to be picked up, either.\" \"No doubt a part of the gang,\" said Brice, with increased bitterness; \"I see it all now.\" \"No!\" said Bill decisively, \"that ain't Snapshot Harry's style; he's a clean fighter, with no underhand tricks. And I don't believe he threw down that tree, either. Look yer, sonny!\" he added, suddenly laying his hand on Brice's shoulder, \"a hundred to one that that was the work of a couple o' d----d sneaks or traitors in that gang",

The man he was seeking was within his possible reach, if the story he had heard was true. The detectives would not be likely to interfere with his plans, for he was the only man who really wished to meet the fugitive. The presence of Poole made him uneasy, though he had never met the man before. Was it barely possible that he was on the same mission on behalf of others? IF what he heard was true, there might be others equally involved with the absconding manager. But then the spies--how could the deputy sheriff elude them, and how could HE? He was turning impatiently away from the window when his eye caught sight of a straggling file of Chinamen breasting the storm on their way up the hill. A sudden idea seized him. Perhaps THEY were the spies in question. He remembered the driver's story. A sudden flash of intuition made him now understand the singular way the file of coolies which they met had diverted their course after passing the wagon. They had recognized the deputy on the box. Stay!--there was another Chinaman in the coach; HE might have given them the signal. He glanced hurriedly around the room for him; he was gone. Perhaps he had already joined the file he had just seen. His only hope was to follow them--but how? and how to do it",

BILSON'S HOUSEKEEPER FROM SAND HILL TO PINE A NIECE OF SNAPSHOT HARRY'S I There was a slight jarring though the whole frame of the coach, a grinding and hissing from the brakes, and then a sudden jolt as the vehicle ran upon and recoiled from the taut pole-straps of the now arrested horses. The murmur of a voice in the road was heard, followed by the impatient accents of Yuba Bill, the driver. \"Wha-a-t? Speak up, can't ye?\" Here the voice uttered something in a louder key, but equally unintelligible to the now interested and fully awakened passengers. One of them dropped the window nearest him and looked out. He could see the faint glistening of a rain-washed lantern near the wheelers' heads, mingling with the stronger coach lights, and the glow of a distant open cabin door through the leaves and branches of the roadside. The sound of falling rain on the roof, a soft swaying of wind-tossed trees, and an impatient movement on the box-seat were all they heard. Then",

He resented the interference youthfully by doing the very thing he would have preferred NOT to do, and with assumed carelessness--yet feeling in his pocket to assure himself that the key of the treasure compartment was safe--turned to follow them. \"Won't YOU come too?\" said the journalist, politely addressing the cynical passenger. \"No, I thank you! I'll take charge of the coach,\" was the smiling rejoinder, as he settled himself more comfortably in his seat. The little procession moved away in silence. Oddly enough, no one, except the lady, really cared to go, and two--the expressman and journalist--would have preferred to remain on the coach. But the national instinct of questioning any purely arbitrary authority probably was a sufficient impulse. As they neared the opened door of what appeared to be a four-roomed, unpainted, redwood boarded cabin, the passenger who had occupied the seat near the window said,-- \"I'll go first and sample the shanty.\" He was not, however, so far in advance of them but that the others could hear quite distinctly his offhand introduction of their party on the threshold, and the somewhat lukewarm response of the inmates. \"We thought we'd just drop in and be sociable until the coach was ready to start again,\" he continued, as the other passengers entered. \"This yer gentleman is Ned Brice, Adams &",

Seen from the coach top, the horses appeared to be cleaving their way through a dark, shining olive sea, that parted before and closed behind them, as they slowly passed. The leaders were just emerging from it, and Bill was gathering up his slackened reins, when a peremptory voice called, \"Halt!\" At the same moment the coach lights flashed upon a masked and motionless horseman in the road. Bill made an impulsive reach for his whip, but in the same instant checked himself, reined in his horses with a suppressed oath, and sat perfectly rigid. Not so the expressman, who caught up his rifle, but it was arrested by Bill's arm, and his voice in his ear! \"Too late!--we're covered!--don't be a d----d fool!\" The inside passengers, still encompassed by obscurity, knew only that the stage had stopped. The \"outsiders\" knew, by experience, that they were covered by unseen guns in the wayside branches, and scarcely moved. \"I didn't think it was the square thing to stop you, Bill, till you'd got through your work,\" said a masterful but not unpleasant voice, \"and if you'll just hand down the express box, I'll pass you and the rest of your load through free.
