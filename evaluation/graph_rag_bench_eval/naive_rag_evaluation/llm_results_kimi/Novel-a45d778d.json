It was her mustang he was ridin' when the row happened near her house.\" \"Well?\" said the editor, with disconcerting placidity. \"Well,\"--hesitated the foreman, \"you see, they're a bad lot, those Greasers, especially the Ramierez, her husband.\" The editor knew that the foreman was only echoing the provincial prejudice against this race, which he himself had always combated. Ramierez kept a fonda or hostelry on a small estate,--the last of many leagues formerly owned by the Spanish grantee, his landlord,--and had a wife of some small coquetries and redundant charms. Gambling took place at the fonda, and it was said the common prejudice against the Mexican did not, however, prevent the American from trying to win his money. \"Then you think Ramierez was jealous of the colonel? But in that case he would have knifed him,--Spanish fashion,--and not without a struggle.\" \"There's more ways they have o' killin' a man than that; he might hev been dragged",

From what he himself had said, the theory of the foreman as to the motives of the attack might have been possible, and the assault itself committed while the colonel was unconscious. Mr. Grey, however, kept this to himself, briefly told his foreman that he found no reason to add to the account already in type, and dismissed the subject from his mind. The colonel left the town the next day. One morning a week afterward, the foreman entered the sanctum cautiously, and, closing the door of the composing-room behind him, stood for a moment before the editor with a singular combination of irresolution, shamefacedness, and humorous discomfiture in his face. Answering the editor's look of inquiry, he began slowly, \"Mebbe ye remember when we was talkin' last week o' Colonel Starbottle's accident, I sorter allowed that he knew all the time WHY he was attacked that way, only he wouldn't tell.\" \"Yes, I remember you were incredulous,\" said the editor, smiling. \"Well, I take it all back! I reckon he told all he knew. I was wrong! I cave!\" \"Why?\" asked the editor wonderingly. \"Well, I have been through the mill myself!\" He unbuttoned his shirt collar, pointed to his neck, which showed a slight abrasion and a small livid mark of",

Senor Ramierez was not aware of any suspicious loiterers among the frequenters of the fonda, and except from some drunken American or Irish revelers he had been free of disturbance. Ah! the peon--an old vaquero--was not an angel, truly, but he was dangerous only to the bull and the wild horses--and he was afraid even of Cota! Mr. Grey was fain to ride home empty of information. He was still more concerned a week later, on returning unexpectedly one afternoon to his sanctum, to hear a musical, childish voice in the composing-room. It was Cota! She was there, as Richards explained, on his invitation, to view the marvels and mysteries of printing at a time when they would not be likely to \"disturb Mr. Grey at his work.\" But the beaming face of Richards and the simple tenderness of his blue eyes plainly revealed the sudden growth of an evidently sincere passion, and the unwonted splendors of his best clothes showed how carefully he had prepared for the occasion. Grey was worried and perplexed, believing the girl a malicious flirt. Yet nothing could be more captivating than her simple and childish curiosity, as she watched Richards swing the lever of the press, or stood by his side as he marshaled the type",

For in that case, I may say, without vanity, that--er--the--er senora would have come to my assistance.\" \"But not her husband?\" The old-fashioned shirt-frill which the colonel habitually wore grew erectile with a swelling indignation, possibly half assumed to conceal a certain conscious satisfaction beneath. \"Mr. Grey,\" he said, with pained severity, \"as a personal friend of mine, and a representative of the press,--a power which I respect,--I overlook a disparaging reflection upon a lady, which I can only attribute to the levity of youth and thoughtlessness. At the same time, sir,\" he added, with illogical sequence, \"if Ramierez felt aggrieved at my attentions, he knew where I could be found, sir, and that it was not my habit to decline giving gentlemen--of any nationality--satisfaction--sir!--personal satisfaction.\" He paused, and then added, with a singular blending of anxiety and a",

A man as peppery as the colonel would have been equally alert in defense. \"They feared that you might have been ill used by some evilly disposed person during your unconsciousness,\" explained the editor diplomatically; \"but as you say THAT was only for a moment, and that you were aware of everything that happened\"--He paused. \"Perfectly, sir! Perfectly! As plain as I see this julep before me. I had just left the Ramierez rancho. The senora,--a devilish pretty woman, sir,--after a little playful badinage, had offered to lend me her daughter's mustang if I could ride it home. You know what it is, Mr. Grey,\" he said gallantly. \"I'm an older man than you, sir, but a challenge from a d----d fascinating creature, I trust, sir, I am not yet old enough to decline.
