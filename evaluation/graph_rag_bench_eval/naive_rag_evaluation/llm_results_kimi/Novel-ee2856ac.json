  "question": "According to the CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER, how does the consumption of alcohol impact the brain's ability to function, specifically in terms of poisoning the mind, preventing clear thinking, and interfering with the nerves that carry the brain's messages?",
  "gold_answer": "Alcohol poisons the mind and prevents the brain from thinking well by affecting the nerves through which the brain sends messages.",
  "llm_answer": "The CHILD'S HEALTH PRIMER states that alcohol acts as a poison to the brain and nerves. It deadens the nerves so they cannot carry messages correctly, which prevents the brain from thinking clearly. The text emphasizes that alcohol does not strengthen the mind but instead injures the brain and nerves, ultimately interfering with their ability to function properly.",

      "text": "for going without the rum.\" STRENGTH OF MIND. We have been talking about the strength of muscles; but the very best kind of strength we have is brain strength, or strength of mind. Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can not carry their messages correctly. Then the brain can not think well. Alcohol does not strengthen the mind. Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make him useful and happy. Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole. Would you be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a palace, and had a million of dollars? If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not let alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it. REVIEW QUESTIONS.           1. What things were left out of our bill of fare?           2. How could you measure your strength?           3. How can you gain strength?           4. Why does drinking beer not make",

      "text": "one part of the brain has to take care of all the rest of the body, and keep every organ at work, of course it can never go to sleep itself. If it did, the heart would stop pumping, the lungs would leave off breathing, all other work would stop, and the body would be dead. But there is another part of the brain which does the thinking, and this part needs rest. When you are asleep, you are not thinking, but you are breathing and other work of the body is going on. If the thinking part of the brain does not have good quiet sleep, it will soon wear out. A worn-out brain is not easy to repair. If well cared for, your brain will do the best of work for you for seventy or eighty years without complaining. The nerves are easily tired out, and they need much rest. They get tired if we do one thing too long at a time; they are rested by a change of work. IS ALCOHOL GOOD FOR THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN? Think of the wonderful work the brain is all the time doing for you! You ought to give it the best of food to keep it in good working order. Any drink that contains alcohol is not a food to make one strong; but is a poison to hurt, and at last to kill. It injures the brain and nerves so that they can not work well, and send their messages properly. That is why the drunkard does not",
