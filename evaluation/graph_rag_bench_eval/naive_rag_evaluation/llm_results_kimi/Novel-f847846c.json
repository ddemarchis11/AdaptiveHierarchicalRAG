  "question": "Imagine you are Young Simon. Write a diary entry about your family connections and your feelings about the events involving your cousin Cæsar and Roxie.",
  "gold_answer": "As the only son of S. S. Simon, I often hear stories about our family. My cousin, Cæsar, has been at the center of recent events, from delivering a note to the Governor to helping Simon learn about Roxie's family. I hear Roxie has been charged, and I worry for her. Our family feels so interconnected, especially with big-sis raising Cæsar and our ties to the Carlow and Brindle families.",
  "llm_answer": "April 6, 1861  \nOn board the steamer bound for New Orleans  \n\nI feel the river mist on my face and the tremor of the engines in my bones, and I must set down what I dare not speak aloud.  \n\nI am Simon—Simon who bears the name of a father I never knew, and of an uncle whose fortune I never sought.  Until this winter I believed myself the last twig on a dead tree; my mother’s people, the Wades, were “poor trash,” and Roxie’s blunt honesty only echoed what I had always felt.  Yet yesterday cousin Cæsar—grave, silent Cæsar—unfolded a tale that makes my blood hurry even while it chills me.  Twenty thousand dollars, twenty years of interest, a vanished will, and heirs scattered from Kentucky to Chicago—heirs that include the bright-eyed girl who laughs at my awkwardness and calls herself “nothing but poor trash” too.  The irony is a bitter sweetness on my tongue: the heir to an Arkansas cotton kingdom may be the very woman who once had no surname but Daymon.  \n\nCæsar watches me as a physician watches a pulse—steady, measuring.  He has carried these secrets since before I could walk, and now, because a spring and a winter have silvered my own temples, he delivers them like a physician’s draught—half hope, half poison.  He says the claim against the estate is lawful, that Roxie’s right is as clean as river gravel, yet he whispers of “compromise” and “hazards of the die.”  I hear the click of the dice even now, though the gaming table is still miles away.  \n\nI love her—there, I have written it.  I love Roxie for the quick courage that let her board this boat alone, for the scorn she casts upon pretense, for the way she steadied my arm when the coughing took me on the hurricane deck.  But love feels a paltry coin when I must lay it beside the knowledge that my death may be the key that unlocks her fortune.  The doctors in St. Thomas spoke of “months, perhaps weeks”; Cæsar’s eyes, though he never repeated the phrase, have said the same.  If I wed her and die, she gains a million; if I flee from her, she may lose even the poor comfort of a name.  The arithmetic is brutal, and my heart rebels against the ledger.  \n\nTonight she asked me for no promise, only smiled when the river moon silvered her cheek and said, “We will sort it out in Chicago come spring.”  Chicago seems an eternity away; spring seems a cruelty.  Yet I caught Cæsar’s glance over her head—anxious, protective, almost tender—and understood that he, too, is gambling: that the die he casts is not merely for land and cotton but for the right of two outcasts to claim a future.  \n\nSo I write this by lamplight, while the boat bears us southward through the dark.  If I die before we reach the city, let these pages speak for me: that I was not merely the last Simon, but a man who tried to turn the curse of an inheritance into a dowry for the woman he loved; that cousin Cæsar, dour and faithful, was the truest kinsman fortune ever gave me; and that Roxie—Roxie Daymon, Roxie Fairfield, Roxie whoever she chooses to be—shall have from my hand whatever justice the law can be forced to yield, even if it be the last act of a dying prince of poor trash.  \n\nThe engines throb like a heart.  Mine answers, unevenly.  I shall seal this entry and place it in Cæsar’s keeping, so that if the Angel of caution again lays finger to lip, some echo of my voice may yet reach her.",

Cousin Cæsar now told young Simon the whole story. Twenty-thousand dollars, with twenty years interest, was against his estate. Roxie Daymon, the young lady on the boat, was an heir, others lived in Kentucky--all of which cousin Cæsar learned from a descendant of Brindle Bill.

Young Simon and cousin Cæsar left for the West Indies.--Young Simon and Roxie Daymon were engaged to be married the following spring at Chicago. Simon saw many beautiful women in his travels--but the image of Roxie Daymon was ever before him. The good Angel of observation has failed to inform us, of Roxie Daymon's feelings and object in the match. A young and beautiful woman; full of life and vigor consenting to wed a dying man, _hushed_ the voice of the good Angel, and he has said nothing. Spring with its softening breezes returned--the ever to be remembered spring of 1861. The shrill note of the iron horse announced the arrival of young Simon and cousin Cæsar in Chicago, on the 7th day of April, 1861. Simon had lived upon excitement, and reaching the destination of his hopes--the great source of his life failed--cousin Cæsar carried him into the hotel--he never stood alone again--the marriage was put off--until Simon should be better. On the second day, cousin Cæsar was preparing to leave the room, on business in a distant part of the city. Roxie had been several times alone with Simon, and was then present. Roxie handed a sealed note to cousin Cæsar, politely asking him to deliver it. The note was inscribed, Gov. Morock, No.",

Cousin Cæsar had been absent but a short time, when that limb of the law appeared and wrote a will dictated by young Simon; bequeathing all of his possessions, without reserve to Roxie Daymon. “How much,” said Roxie, as the Governor was about to leave. “Only ten dollars, madam,” said the Governor, as he stuffed the bill carelessly in his vest pocket and departed. Through the long vigils of the night cousin Cæsar sat by the side of the dying man; before the sun had silvered the eastern horizon, the soul of young Simon was with his fathers. The day was consumed in making preparations for the last, honor due the dead. Cousin Cæsar arranged with a party to take the remains to Arkansas, and place the son by the side of the father, on the home plantation. The next morning as cousin Cæsar was scanning the morning papers, the following brief notice attracted his attention: “Young Simon, the wealthy young cotton planter, who died in the city yesterday, left by his last will and testament his whole estate, worth more than a million of dollars, to Roxie Daymon, a young lady of this city.” Cousin Cæsar was bewildered and astonished. He was a stranger in the",

My father's name was Cæsar Simon, and I bear his name. My mother's name was Nancy Wade. I do not remember either of them I was partly raised by my sisters, and the balance of the time I have tried to raise myself, but it seems it will take me a Iong time to _make a raise_--” at this point, Brindle interfered in breathless suspense, with the inquiry, “Did you have an uncle named S. S. Simon?” “I have heard my sister say as much,” continued Simon. “Then your dream is interpreted,” said Brindle, emphatically. “Your Uncle, S. S. Simon, has left one of the largest estates in Arkansas, and now you are on the steam wagon again,” said Brindle, slapping his companion on the shoulder. Brindle had been instructed by his mother, and made Cousin Cæsar acquainted with the outline of all the history detailed in this narrative, except the history of Roxie Daymon _alias_ Roxie Fairfield, in Chicago. The next day the two men were hired as hands to go down the river on a flat-bottom boat. Roxie Daymon, whose death has been recorded, left an only daughter, now grown to womanhood, and bearing her",

But place upon the beam the pea of their actions while upon the stage, _on either side_, an the poise may be up or down. More than this, your orator has nothing to say of the war, except its effect upon the characters we describe. The bright blossoms of a May morning were opening to meet the sunlight, while the surrounding foliage was waving in the soft breeze ol spring; on the southern bank of the beautiful Ohio, where the momentous events of the future were concealed from the eyes of the preceding generation by the dar veil of the coming revolutions of the globe. We see Cousin Cæsar and Cliff Carlo in close counsel, upon the subject of meeting the expenses of the contest at law over the Simon estate, in the State of Arkansas. Cliff Carlo was rather non-committal. Roxie Daymon was a near relative, and the unsolved problem in the case of compromise and law did not admit of haste on the part of the Carlo family. Compromise was not the forte of Cousin Cæsar, To use his own words, “I have made the cast, and will stand the hazard of the die.” But the enterprise, with surrounding circumstances, would have baffled a bolder man than Cæsar Simon.
