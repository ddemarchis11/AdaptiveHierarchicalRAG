After a hearty supper, in the course of which Toto related as much of his and Bruin's adventures in the hermit's cave as he thought proper, the whole family gathered around the blazing hearth. Toto brought the pan of apples and the dish of nuts; the grandmother took up her knitting, and said, with a smile: \"And who will tell us a story, this evening? We have had none for two evenings now, and it is high time that we heard something new. Cracker, my dear, is it not your turn?\" \"I think it is,\" said the squirrel, hastily cramming a couple of very large nuts into his cheek-pouches, \"and if you like, I will tell you a story that Mrs. Cow told me a day or two ago. It is about a cow that jumped over the moon.\" \"What!\" cried Toto. \"Why, I've known that story ever since I was a baby! And it isn't a story, either, it's a rhyme,-- \"Hey diddle diddle, The cat and the fiddle, The cow--\" \"Yes, yes! I know, Toto,\" interrupted the squirrel. \"She told me that, too, and said it was a pack of lies, and that people like you didn't know anything about the real truth of the matter. So now, if you will just listen to me, I will tell you how it really",

I should like very much to come, Woodmouse, if you think it would not trouble any of your family. I promise you that <DW53> shall be on his very best behavior, and--I'll tell you what!\" he added, \"I will provide the music, as I did last summer, at the Rabbit's Rinktum.\" \"No, not really! will you, though?\" cried the little woodmouse, his slender tail quivering with delight. \"We shall be infinitely obliged, Mr. Toto, infinitely obliged, sir! We shall count upon you both. Bring Cracker, too, and any other friends who may be staying with you. Would your grandmother, possibly--eh? care to come?\" \"Thank you!\" said Toto, gravely, \"I think not. My grandmother never goes out in the evening.\" \"We might bring Bruin!\" suggested <DW53>, with a sly wink at Toto. But here the poor little woodmouse looked so unutterably",

You never were anything but a boy, were you?\" \"Oh, no, of course not!\" said Toto. \"But that is different. When Granny was young, she was a girl, you see.\" \"I don't believe it!\" said the bear, stoutly. \"I--do--_not_--believe it! I saw a girl once--many years ago; it squinted, and its hair was frowzy, and it wore a hideous basket of flowers on its head,--a dreadful creature! Madam never can have looked like _that_!\" At this moment a knock was heard at the door. Toto flew to open it, and with a beaming face ushered in the old hermit, who entered leaning on his stick, with his crow perched on one shoulder and the hawk on the other. Then, what greetings followed! What introductions! What bows and courtesies, and whisking of tails and flapping of wings! The hermit's bow in greeting to the old lady was so stately that Master <DW53> was consumed with a desire to imitate it; and in so doing, he",

Last of all, you should have seen the dear old grandmother, the beloved Madam, with her snowy curls and cap and kerchief; and the ebony stick which generally lived in a drawer and silver paper, and only came out on great occasions. How proud Toto was of his Granny! and how the others all stood around her, gazing with wondering admiration at her gold-bowed spectacles (for those she usually wore were of horn) and the large breastpin, with a weeping-willow displayed upon it, which fastened her kerchief. \"Made out of your grandfather's tail, did you say, Toto?\" said the bear, in an undertone. \"Astonishing!\" \"No, no, Bruin!\" cried the boy, half pettishly. \"Made out of his _hair_! Surely you might know by this time that we have no tails.\" \"True! true!\" murmured the bear, apologetically. \"I beg your pardon, Toto, boy. You are not really vexed with old Bruin?\" Toto rubbed his curly head affectionately against the shaggy black one, in token of amity, and the bear continued:-- \"When Madam was a young grandmother, was she as beautiful as she is now?\" \"Why, yes, I fancy so,\" replied",

When all was told, Toto proceeded to unpack the basket he had brought, which contained gingerbread, eggs, apples, and a large can of butter-milk marked \"For Bruin.\" Many were the joyous exclamations called forth by this present of good cheer; and it seemed as if the old hermit could not sufficiently express his gratitude to Toto and his good grandmother. \"Oh, don't!\" cried the boy, half distressed by the oft-repeated thanks. \"If you only knew how we _like_ it! It's so jolly, you know. Besides,\" he added, \"I want you to do something for _me_ now, Mr. Baldhead, so that will turn the tables. A shower is coming up, and it is early yet, so I need not go home for an hour. So, will you not tell us a story? We are very fond of stories,--Bruin and Pigeon Pretty and I.\" \"A story! a story!\" cried every one, eagerly. \"A story, hey?\" said the good hermit, smiling. \"With all my heart, dear lad!
