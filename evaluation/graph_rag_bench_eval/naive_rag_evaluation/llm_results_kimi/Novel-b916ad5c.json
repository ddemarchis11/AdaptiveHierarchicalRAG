  "question": "What chain of evidence links the kinnor to the British Museum’s collection of cymbals?",
  "gold_answer": "The kinnor is rendered as harp, which is in the Anglo-Saxon manuscript that is in the British Museum, which also has cymbals.",
  "llm_answer": "The chain of evidence linking the kinnor to the British Museum’s collection of cymbals is that both are part of the museum’s holdings of ancient musical instruments. Specifically, the text mentions that “Among the Egyptian antiquities in the British museum are also several small bells of…” and earlier references to cymbals and other instruments like the sistrum and tambourine, indicating that the kinnor (as an ancient instrument) is contextually grouped within this same collection framework.",

      "text": "This is an evidence of fine feeling on the part of Sterne’s widow, with which she has never been duly credited. But an anonymous editor published early in 1775[34] a volume entitled “Letters from Yorick to Eliza,” a brief little collection, the source of which has never been clear, but whose genuineness has never been questioned. The editor himself waives all claim to proof “which might be drawn concerning their authenticity from the character of the gentleman who had the perusal of them, and with Eliza’s permission, faithfully copied them at Bombay.” In July of this same year[35] was published a volume entitled “Sterne’s Letters to His Friends on Various Occasions, to which is added his History of a Watchcoat with Explanatory Notes,” containing twelve letters (one by Dr. Eustace) and the watchcoat story. Some of these letters had appeared previously in British magazines, and one, copied from the _London Magazine_, was translated in the _Wandsbecker Bothe_ for April 16, 1774.[36] A translation of the same letter was given in the _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_, 1774, pp. 286-7. Three of these letters only are accepted by Prof. Saintsbury (Nos. 7, 124, the letter of Dr. Eustace, and 125). Of the others,",

Might it not help the ethnologists to follow the migrations of the human race from this western continent to the eastern and southern shores of Asia, across the wastes of the Pacific Ocean? I am told by unimpeachable witnesses that they have seen the red or bloody hand in more than one of the temples of the South Sea islanders; and his Excellency Fred. P. Barlee, Esq., the actual governor of British Honduras, has assured me that he has examined this seemingly indelible imprint of the red hand on some rocks in caves in Australia. There is scarcely a monument in Yucatan that does not preserve the imprint of the open upraised hand, dipped in red paint of some sort, perfectly visible on its walls. I lately took tracings of two of these imprints that exist in the back saloon of the main hall, in the governor's house at Uxmal, in order to calculate the height of the personage who thus attested to those of his race, as I learned from one of my Indian friends, who passes for a wizard, that the building was _in naa_, my house. I may well say that the archway of the palace of the priests, toward the court, was nearly covered with them. Yet I am not aware that such symbol was ever used",

The third kind of drum was almost identical with the _darabouka_ (or _darabukkeh_) of the modern Egyptians. The Tambourine was either round, like that which is at the present time in use in Europe as well as in the east; or it was of an oblong square shape, slightly incurved on the four sides. The Sistrum consisted of a frame of bronze or brass into which three or four metal bars were loosely inserted, so as to produce a jingling noise when the instrument was shaken. The bars were often made in the form of snakes, or they terminated in the head of a goose. Not unfrequently a few metal rings were strung on the bars, to increase the noise. The frame was sometimes ornamented with the figure of a cat. The largest sistra which have been found are about eighteen inches in length, and the smallest about nine inches. The sistrum was principally used by females in religious performances. Its Egyptian name was _seshesh_. The Egyptian cymbals closely resembled our own in shape. There are two pairs of them in the British museum. One pair was found in a coffin enclosing the mummy of a sacred musician, and is deposited in the same case with the mummy and coffin. Among the Egyptian antiquities in the British museum are also several small bells of",

They sat on the coolest corner in Port Said, their table commanding both the cross-way of Chareh Sultan el Osman, and the short, glaring vista of desert dust and starved young acacias which led to the black hulks of shipping in the Canal. From the Bar la Poste came orchestral strains--\"Ai nostri monti\"--performed by a piano indoors and two violins on the pavement. The sounds contended with a thin, scattered strumming of cafe mandolins, the tinkle of glasses, the steady click of dominoes and backgammon; then were drowned in the harsh chatter of Arab coolies who, all grimed as black as Nubians, and shouldering spear-headed shovels, tramped inland, their long tunics stiff with coal-dust, like a band of chain-mailed Crusaders lately caught in a hurricane of powdered charcoal. Athwart them, Parisian gowns floated past on stout Italian forms; hulking third-class Australians, in shirtsleeves, slouched along toward their mail-boat, hugging whiskey bottles, baskets of oranges, baskets of dates; British soldiers, khaki-clad for India, raced galloping donkeys through the crowded and dusty",

Each tube has a separate mouth-piece and six finger-holes, five of which are at the upper side and one is underneath. The _syrinx_, or Pandean pipe, had from three to nine tubes, but seven was the usual number. The straight trumpet, _salpinx_, and the curved horn, _keras_, made of brass, were used exclusively in war. The small hand-drum, called _tympanon_, resembled in shape our tambourine, but was covered with parchment at the back as well as at the front. The _kymbala_ were made of metal, and resembled our small cymbals. The _krotala_ were almost identical with our castanets, and were made of wood or metal. THE ETRUSCANS AND ROMANS. The Romans are recorded to have derived some of their most popular instruments originally from the Etruscans; a people which at an early period excelled all other Italian nations in the cultivation of the arts as well as in social refinement, and which possessed musical instruments similar to those of the Greeks. It must, however, be remembered that many of the vases and other specimens of art which have been found in Etruscan tombs, and on which delineations of lyres and other",
