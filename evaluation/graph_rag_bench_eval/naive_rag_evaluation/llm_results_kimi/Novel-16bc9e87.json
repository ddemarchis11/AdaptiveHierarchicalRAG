Hesselgrave was employed in nearly all the St. Paul offices at various times. He was lieutenant in the First Minnesota Heavy Artillery, and is now engaged in farming in the Minnesota valley. William A. Hill came to St. Paul during the early '50s. He was a member of the Seventh Minnesota. Ole Johnson was a member of the First Minnesota regiment, and died in a hospital in Virginia. William F. Russel, a compositor on the Pioneer, organized a company of sharpshooters in St. Paul, and they served throughout the war in the army of the Potomac. S. Teverbaugh and H.I. Vance were territorial printers, and were both in the army, but served in regiments outside the state. There were a large number of other printers in the military service during the civil war, but they were not territorial printers and their names are not included in the above list. TERRITORIAL PRINTERS IN CIVIL LIFE. One of the brightest of the many bright young men who came to Minnesota at an early day was Mr. James Mills. For a time he worked on the case at the old Pioneer office, but was soon transferred to the editorial department, where he remained for a number of years. After the war he returned to Pittsburgh, his former home,",

NARRATION OF SOME OF THE EXCITING EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862--FORT RIDGELY, NEW ULM AND BIRCH COULIE--OTHER DAY AND WABASHA--GREAT EXCITEMENT IN ST. PAUL. In July and August, 1862, President Lincoln issued proclamations calling for the enlistment of 600,000 volunteers for the purpose of reinforcing the army, then vainly endeavoring to suppress the Southern rebellion. It was probably one of the most gloomy periods in the history of the Civil war.",

The Times continued under the management of Mr. Newson until the first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R. Marshall and Thomas F. Slaughter, who started the St. Paul Daily Press with its material. The Press proved to be too much of a competitor for the Minnesotian, and in a short time Dr. Foster was compelled to surrender to its enterprising projectors, they having purchased the entire plant. This ended the rivalry between the two Republican dailies. Dr. Foster and Maj. Newson, some time afterward, received commissions in the volunteer service of the army during the Civil war, and George W. Moore was appointed collector of the port of St. Paul, a position he held for more than twenty years. Does any one remember that St. Paul had a paper called the Daily North Star? The historians of St. Paul and Ramsey county do not seem to ever have chronicled the existence of this sprightly little sheet. During the presidential campaign of 1860 we had two kinds of Democrats--the Douglas and the Breckinridge or administration Democrats. There were only two papers in the state that espoused the cause of Mr. Breckinridge--the Chatfield Democrat",

THE FIRST BATTLE DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN WHICH THE UNION FORCES SCORED A DECISIVE VICTORY--THE SECOND MINNESOTA THE HEROES OF THE DAY--THE REBEL GENERAL ZOLLICOFFER KILLED. Every Minnesotian's heart swells with pride whenever mention is made of the grand record of the volunteers from the North Star State in the great struggle for the suppression of the rebellion. At the outbreak of the war Minnesota was required to furnish one regiment, but so intensely patriotic were its citizens that nearly two regiments volunteered at the first call of the president. As only ten companies could go in the first regiment the surplus was held in readiness for a second call, which it was thought would be soon forthcoming. On the 16th of June, 1861, Gov. Ramsey received notice that a second regiment would be acceptable, and accordingly the companies already organized with two or three additions made",

McClellan on account of the abolition sentiments expressed in its songs. The general was apparently unable to interpret the handwriting on the wall, as long before the war was ended the entire army was enthusiastically chanting that beautiful melody to the king of abolitionists--   \"John Brown's body lies moldering in the grave   And his soul is marching on.\" Gen. McClellan was at one time the idol of the army, as well as of the entire American people. Before the war he was chief engineer of the Illinois Central railroad and made frequent trips to St. Paul to see the future Mrs. McClellan, a Miss Marcy, daughter of Maj. R.B. Marcy of the regular army, who lived in the old Henry M. Rice homestead on Summit avenue. When Gen. McClellan was in command of the Army of the Potomac Maj. Marcy was his chief of staff. One of the original Hutchinsons is still living, as indicated by the following dispatch, published since the above was written: \"Chicago, Ill., Jan. 4, 1902.--John W.
