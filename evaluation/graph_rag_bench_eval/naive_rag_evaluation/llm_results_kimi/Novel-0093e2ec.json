Nearly two hundred houses were burned before the town was evacuated, leaving nothing standing but a few houses inside the hastily constructed barricade. The long procession of families leaving their desolated homes, many of them never to return, formed one of the saddest scenes in the history of the outbreak, and will ever be remembered by the gallant force under the command of Judge Flandrau, who led them to a place of safety. As soon as Gen. Sibley arrived at Fort Ridgely a detail of Company A of the Sixth regiment, under command of Capt. H.P. Grant of St. Paul, and seventy members of the Cullen Guards, under the command of Capt. Jo Anderson, also of St. Paul, and several citizen volunteers, all under the command of Maj. Joseph R. Brown, was sent out with instructions to bury the dead and rescue the wounded, if any could be found, from their perilous surroundings. They were St. Paul organizations and most all of their members were St. Paul boys. They never had had an opportunity to drill and most of them were not familiar with the use of firearms.

In 1861 Peter and Caroline Richings spent a part of the summer in St. Paul, and local amusement lovers were delightfully entertained by these celebrities during their sojourn. During the war a number of dramatic and musical performances were given at the Athenaeum for the boys in blue. The cantata of \"The Haymakers,\" for the benefit of the sanitary commission made quite a hit, and old residents will recollect Mrs. Winne, Mrs. Blakeley and Prof. Perkins, who took the leading parts. Prof. Phil Roher and Otto Dreher gave dramatic performances both in German and English for some time after the close of the war. Plunkett's Dramatic company, with Susan Denin as the star, filled the boards at this hall a short time before the little old opera house was constructed on Wabasha street. During the Sioux massacre a large number of maimed refugees were brought to the city and found temporary shelter in this place. In 1853 Market hall, on the corner of Wabasha and Seventh streets, was built, and it was one of the principal places of amusement. The Hough Dramatic company, with Bernard, C.W. Couldock, Sallie St. Clair and others were among the notable performers who entertained theatergoers. In 1860 the Wide Awakes used this place for a drill hall, and so proficient did the",

Many instances are recorded of farmers leaving their harvesters in the field and joining the grand army then forming for the defense of the imperilled state and nation, while their courageous and energetic wives have gone to the fields and finished harvesting the ripened crops. By reason of the outbreak the Sioux forfeited to the government, in addition to an annual annuity of $68,000 for fifty years, all the lands they held in Minnesota, amounting in the aggregate to about 750,000 acres, worth at the present time something like $15,000,000.

The Pioneer Guards, the City Guards, the St. Paul Light Artillery, the St. Paul fire department and numerous secret organizations would form in procession and march to the capitol, and in the hall of the house of representatives elaborate exercises commemorative of the birth of the nation's first great hero would take place. Business was generally suspended and none of the daily papers would be issued on the following day. In 1857 Adalina Patti appeared in St. Paul for the first time. She was about sixteen years old and was with the Ole Bull Concert company. They traveled on a small steamboat and gave concerts in the river towns. Their concert took place in the hall of the house of representatives of the old capitol, that being the only available place at the time. Patti's concert came near being nipped in the bud by an incident that has never been printed. Two boys employed as messengers at the capitol, both of whom are now prominent business men in the city, procured a key to the house, and, in company with a number of other kids, proceeded to representative hall, where they were frequently in the habit of congregating for the purpose of playing cards, smoking cigars, and committing such other depradations as it was possible for kids to conceive.

Taylor's front and retreated toward the City of Mexico, in order to assist in the defense of that city against the American forces under the command of Gen. Scott. Peace was declared in 1848 and the Third dragoons were ordered to Jefferson barracks, St. Louis, where they were mustered out of the service. Capt. Shelly took passage in a steamer for St. Paul, where he arrived in July, 1849, being the first printer to permanently locate in Minnesota. The Pioneer was the first paper printed in St. Paul, but the Register and Chronicle soon followed. Capt. Shelly's first engagement was in the office of the Register, but he soon changed to the Pioneer, and was employed by Mr. Goodhue at the time of his tragic death. When Col. Robertson Started the Daily Democrat Capt. Shelly was connected with that office, and remained there until the Pioneer and Democrat consolidated. Capt. Shelly was a member of the old Pioneer guards, and when President Lincoln called for men to suppress the rebellion the old patriotism was aroused in him, and he organized, in company with Major Brackett, a company for what was afterward known as Brackett's battalion. Brackett's battalion consisted of three Minnesota companies, and they were mustered into service in September,",
