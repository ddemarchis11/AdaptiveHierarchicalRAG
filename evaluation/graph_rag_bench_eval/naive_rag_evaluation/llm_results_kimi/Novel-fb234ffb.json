  "question": "In what way was the city of Hamburg involved in the reception of Sterne's works in Germany, especially through the roles of Bode as editor and the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' in reviewing 'Tristram Shandy'?",
  "gold_answer": "Hamburg was involved through the Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent, which reviewed Tristram Shandy and was edited by Bode.",
  "llm_answer": "Hamburg played a central part in the German reception of Sterne’s *Tristram Shandy* through two closely-linked channels:\n\n1. The newspaper *Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent* (from 1763-1770) served as an important critical forum.  \n   - In 1764 it printed a detailed, often quoted review of the first German translation (Zückert 1763), correcting its mistakes and offering sample renderings of Sterne’s text.  \n   - The same paper later carried notices and polemics connected with later translations and with Bode’s own work.\n\n2. Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, resident in Hamburg, was successively editor of that newspaper (1762/63) and, a decade later, the translator-publisher of the most influential German version of *Tristram Shandy* (Hamburg, 1774, 9 parts).  \n   - His editorial activity in the 1760s put him in direct contact with contemporary discussion of Sterne; the 1764 review may already reflect his hand.  \n   - In 1774 he issued the complete Hamburg translation, prefaced by a biographical-critical sketch of Sterne that became a standard source for German readers.  \n   - Bode’s list of subscribers (over 650 names) and the re-issue of a second edition in 1769 show how, from Hamburg, his work spread Sterne’s reputation throughout Germany.\n\nThus, through Bode’s dual role as editor of the *Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent* and as translator-publisher, Hamburg functioned as the chief German centre for reviewing, interpreting and disseminating *Tristram Shandy*.",

      "text": "is not to be located with certainty, yet it may well have been Bode, the later apostle of Sterne-worship in Germany. Bode was a resident of Hamburg at this time, was exceptionally proficient in English and, according to Jördens[13] and Schröder,[14] he was in 1762-3 the editor of the _Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_. The precise date when Bode severed his connection with the paper is indeterminate, yet this, the second number of the new year 1764, may have come under his supervision even if his official connection ended exactly with the close of the old year. To be sure, when Bode ten years later published his own version of Shandy, he translated, with the exception of two rather insignificant cases, none of the passages verbally the same as the reviewer in this journal, but it would be unreasonable to attach any great weight to this fact. Eight or nine years later, when undertaking the monumental task of rendering the whole of Shandy into German, it is not likely that Bode would recall the old translations he had made in this review or concern himself about them. A brief comparison of the two sets of translations suggests that the critic was striving merely for accuracy in correcting the errors of Zückert, and that Bode in his formal translation shows a riper and more certain feeling for the choice of words; the effect of purposeful reflection is",

      "text": "Bode’s translation of the Sentimental Journey contains, further, a sketch of Sterne’s life,[26] his character and his works. Bode relates the familiar story of the dog, but misses the point entirely in rendering “puppy” by “Geck” in Sterne’s reply, “So lang er ein Geck ist.” The watchcoat episode is narrated, and a brief account is given of Sterne’s fortunes in London with Tristram Shandy and the sermons. Allusion has already been made to the hints thrown out in this sketch relative to the reading of Sterne in Germany. A translation from Shandy of the passage descriptive of Parson Yorick serves as a portrait for Sterne. A second edition of Bode’s work was published in 1769. The preface, which is dated “Anfang des Monats Mai, 1769,” is in the main identical with the first, but has some significant additions. A word is said relative to his controversy with a critic, which is mentioned later.[27] Bode confesses further that the excellence of his work is due to Ebert and Lessing,[28] though modesty compelled his silence in the previous preface concerning the source of his aid. Bode admits that even this disclosure is prompted by the clever guess of a critic in the _Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent_,[29] who openly named Lessing as",

A reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[10] in an account of Bode’s and Wichmann’s renderings of “Tom Jones,” begs Bode to fulfill the hopes thus raised, saying he could give Yorick’s friends no more valuable or treasured gift. Böttiger in his biographical sketch of Bode expressed regret that the work never saw the light, adding that the work contained so many allusions to contemporary celebrities and hits upon Bode’s acquaintance that wisdom had consigned to oblivion.[11] A correspondent, writing to the _Teutscher Merkur_,[12] minimizes the importance of this so-called commentary, saying “er hatte nie einen Kommentar der Art, . . . auch nur angefangen auszuarbeiten. Die ganze Sache gründet sich auf eine scherzhafte Aeusserung gegen seinem damaligen Freund in Hamburg, welchen er oft mit der ihm eignen Ironie mit diesem Kommentar zu drohen pflegte.” The list of subscribers to Bode’s translation contained upwards of 650 names, among which are Boie, Claudius, Einsieder, Gerstenberg, Gleim, Fräulein",
