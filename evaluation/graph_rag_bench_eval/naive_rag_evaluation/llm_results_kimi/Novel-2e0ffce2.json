  "question": "Write a diary entry as the Parrot, describing your life with your mistress, the farewell, and being snatched away, while referencing the trouble caused to her lover.",
  "gold_answer": "Diary Entry — My days with my mistress were filled with warmth and chatter. Today, I said farewell to Corinna, her eyes glistening with sorrow. I was snatched away by envy, separated from her gentle hands. I have heard it said that my mistress is born to be a cause of trouble to her lover, and perhaps, even my loss plays a part in the tangled affairs of the heart.",
  "llm_answer": "**Diary of the Parrot**  \n*Entry: The Seventh Day*  \n\nBy the perch outside my mistress’s window, I preened my emerald feathers—each one a shard of her laughter, each curl of my tongue a mimicry of her voice. She called me *her little echo*, and I lived to repeat it back to her, a thousand times, until the words tasted of poppy and nut.  \n\nToday, the air tasted of iron. Her lover stood beneath the lattice, his cloak dripping rain or tears—I could not tell. He cried, *“Corinna, farewell!”* and I, fool bird, cried it too, louder, shriller, because it made her smile. She pressed her cheek to my cage. *“Hush, darling. He’ll think you’re mocking him.”*  \n\nI *was* mocking him. What else is a parrot for? I’d learned his groans at midnight, his stammered prayers when she denied him entry. I’d screech them back at dawn, just to watch him flinch. *Sluggish porter! Cruel doorposts!*—his own words, served in my syrupy voice, until he beat the threshold with his fists. She laughed until her shoulders shook.  \n\nBut envy has claws sharper than mine. The seventh day rose blood-red. A gust—*that stormy North wind*—ripped the latch. Wings I’d never used spasmed. As I tumbled, I saw her reach, mouth wide in a silent *no*. My tongue, traitor to the end, cried *“Corinna, farewell!”*—the lover’s phrase, now mine, now hers, now no one’s.  \n\nDarkness smelled of wet earth and copper. My feathers, once brighter than Juno’s peacock, muddied. Somewhere, the lover wept—not for me, but for the silence I’d leave in her room. *What avails it* that I pleased her? The crow survives nine ages; the parrot, one cruel gust.  \n\nIf there’s a grove beyond, let it be full of guileless birds. I’ll perch there still, repeating *“Corinna, farewell!”* until the stars themselves grow weary.  \n\n—*Etched on a tomb smaller than my body*",

All, who poise yourselves in your career in the liquid air; but you, above the rest, affectionate turtle-dove, [360] lament him. Throughout life there was a firm attachment between you, and your prolonged and lasting friendship endured to the end. What the Phocian youth [361] was to the Argive Orestes, the same, parrot, was the turtle-dove to you, so long as it was allowed _by fate._ But what _matters_ that friendship? What the beauty of your rare plumage? What your voice so ingenious at imitating sounds? What avails it that _ever_ since you were given, you pleased my mistress? Unfortunate pride of _all_ birds, you are indeed laid low. With your feathers you could outvie the green emerald, having your purple beak tinted with the ruddy saffron. There was no bird on earth more skilled at imitating sounds; so prettily [362] did you utter words with your lisping notes. Through envy, you were snatched away _from us_: you were the cause of no cruel wars; you were a chatterer, and the lover of peaceful concord. See, the quails, amid _all_ their battles, [363] live on; perhaps, too, for",

And yet your words did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue cried aloud, \"Corinna, farewell!\" [370] At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green. If there is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled. There range far and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole bird _of its kind. There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers; the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate. Received in this home in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his words. [372] A sepulchre covers his bones; a sepulchre small as his body; on which a little stone has _this_ inscription, well suited to itself: \"From this very tomb [377] I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress. I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds.\" ELEGY VII. _He attempts to convince his mistress,",

This great recompense is given; farewell, then, ye illustrious names of heroes; your favour is of no use to me. Ye charming fair, turn your eyes to my lines, which blushing Cupid dictates to me. ELEGY II. _He has seen a lady walking in the portico of the temple of Apollo, and has sent to know if he may wait upon her. She has replied that it is quite impossible, as the eunuch Bagous is set to watch her. Ovid here addresses Bagous, and endeavours to persuade him to relax his watch over the fair; and shows him how he can do so with safety._ |Bagous, [305] with whom is the duty of watching over your mistress, give me your attention, while I say a few but suitable words to you.
