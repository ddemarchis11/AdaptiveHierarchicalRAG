  "question": "In the context of Hamburg's vibrant literary scene, how is Gotthold Ephraim Lessing connected to the publication and critical review of literary works, specifically with regard to his authorship of 'Hamburgische Dramaturgie,' its publication in Hamburg, and the reviewing of Sterne's 'Tristram Shandy' by the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent' (edited by Bode), which played a notable role in the city's literary criticism?",
  "gold_answer": "Lessing wrote 'Hamburgische Dramaturgie', which was published in Hamburg. Additionally, 'Tristram Shandy' was reviewed by the 'Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent', a publication edited by Bode, who was highly regarded in Hamburg.",
  "llm_answer": "Lessing’s authorship of the *Hamburgische Dramaturgie* is not mentioned in the supplied text, nor is any detail about its publication in Hamburg.  \nWhat the passage does show is that, while Bode was editor of the *Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent*, Lessing’s high esteem for Sterne was invoked in the preface to Bode’s German version of *Tristram Shandy*; Lessing’s approval of the project is the only Hamburg-linked connection the text records.",

      "text": "The writer is evidently compelled, as representative of British literary interests, to bear witness to the Shandy craze, but the attitude of the review is plainly indicative of its author’s disbelief in any occasion for especial concern about Yorick in Germany. Sterne himself is mentioned as a fitful whim of British taste, and a German devotion to him is beyond the flight of fancy.[30] Individual authors, aware of international literary conditions, the inner circle of German culture, became acquainted with Tristram Shandy during this period before the publication of the Sentimental Journey and learned to esteem the eccentric parson. Bode’s possible acquaintance with the English original previous to 1764 has been already noted. Lessing’s admiration for Sterne naturally is associated with his two statements of remarkable devotion to Yorick, both of which, however, date from a period when he had already become acquainted with the Journey. At precisely what time Lessing first read Tristram Shandy it is impossible to determine with accuracy. Moses Mendelssohn writes to him in the summer of 1763:[31] “Tristram Shandy is a work of masterly originality. At present, to be sure, I have read only the first two volumes. In the beginning the book vexed me exceedingly. I rambled on from digression to digression without grasping the real humor of the author. I regarded him as a man like our",

      "text": "that is, almost immediately after its English publication, unless Bode, in his enthusiasm for the book which he was offering the public, inserted the word unwarrantably in Lessing’s statement. To return to Bode’s preface. With emphatic protestations, disclaiming vanity in appealing to the authority of so distinguished a friend, Bode proceeds to relate more in detail Lessing’s connection with his endeavor. He does not say that Lessing suggested the translation to him, though his account has been interpreted to mean that, and this fact has been generally accepted by the historians of literature and the biographers of Lessing.[20] The tone of Bode’s preface, however, rather implies the contrary, and no other proof of the supposition is available. What Bode does assert is merely that the name of the scholar whom he quotes as having expressed a willingness to give a part of his own life if Sterne’s literary activity might be continued, would create a favorable prepossession for his original (“ein günstiges Vorurtheil”), and that a translator is often fortunate enough if his selection of a book to translate is not censured. All this implies, on Lessing’s part, only an approval of Bode’s choice, a fact which would naturally follow from the remarkable statement of esteem in the preceding sentence. Bode says further that out of friendship for him and regard for the reader of taste, this author (Lessing), had",

Böttiger claims that the review of Bode’s translation in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ did much to spread the idea of Bode’s authorship, though the reviewer in that periodical[39] only suggests the possibility of German authorship, a suspicion aroused by the substitution of German customs and motif and word-play, together with contemporary literary allusion, allusion to literary mediocrities and obscurities, of such a nature as to preclude the possibility of the book’s being a literal translation from the English. The exact amount and the nature of Bode’s divergence from the original, his alterations and additions, have never been definitely stated by anyone. The reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ is manifestly ignorant of the original. Böttiger is indefinite and partisan, yet his statement of the facts has been generally accepted and constantly repeated. He admits the German coloring given the translation by Bode through German allusions and German word-plays: he says that Bode allowed himself these liberties, feeling that he was no longer dealing with Sterne, a statement of motive on Bode’s part which the latter never makes and never hints at. The only absolute additions which Böttiger mentions as made by Bode to the narrative of Eugenius are the episode, “Das Hündchen,”",
