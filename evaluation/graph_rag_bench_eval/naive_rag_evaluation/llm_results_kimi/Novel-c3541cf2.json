  "question": "How does the narrative reveal the use of nicknames and alternate identities among the central characters, specifically through Georgiana Tidman's use of the nickname George Tidd and Augustin's role as the Dean, and what impact does this have on the unfolding of their personal and social identities?",
  "gold_answer": "Georgiana Tidman uses the nickname George Tidd, and Augustin is also known as the Dean, showing the use of alternate identities among the characters.",
  "llm_answer": "The text shows that Georgiana Tidman openly trades on her racing alias “George Tidd” while her brother Augustin is known only by his clerical title, “the Dean.”  \nGeorgiana insists that the name George Tidd is the one “they’ll tell you all about” at Newmarket; she even labels the champagne hamper “George Tidd” and signs off with it.  By contrast, no one—herself included—ever calls Augustin anything but “Dean”; his given name is reduced to the single whispered “Gus” when she teases him about money.  \n\nThus the narrative uses nicknames to expose the gap between public façade and private self: Georgiana’s sporting persona is freer, louder, and solvent in ready cash, whereas the Dean’s identity is entirely absorbed by his office, leaving him personally penniless and socially immobilised.  The aliases therefore drive the plot—her “George Tidd” reputation supplies the ready money and the racing know-how that the Dean’s clerical name cannot, forcing him to rely on his “widowed sister” and her disreputable but resourceful alter-ego to save the Deanery’s finances and, by extension, his own standing.",
