  "question": "Imagine you are a member of the Chateau Clique writing a private letter about the ongoing conflict with the Patriotes and the struggles with French Canadians.",
  "gold_answer": "Private Letter — The situation grows tenser with each passing day. The Patriotes, emboldened by the support of their French Canadian base, stand in direct conflict with us. Their victories, such as at St Denis, have only strengthened their resolve. Our efforts are met with resistance, and the Assembly’s complaints about the expenditure of public moneys without the consent of the Executive government complicate matters further. The British government, for its part, continues to keep loyal to French Canadians, but their loyalty to the British crown is being sorely tested.",
  "llm_answer": "Private & Confidential  \nChâteau Saint-Louis, 3 December 1837  \n\nMy dear McTavish,\n\nI write in haste, by candle that gutters like the Province itself, to tell you how near we are to breaking this stubborn French spirit.  Colborne’s regulars and our volunteers have swept the countryside from St-Denis to St-Eustache; the rebel strong-holds are blackened shells, and their pretty Patriote flags—those tricoloured rags—now serve only to wrap the dead.  Yet I cannot rejoice.  The habitants still murmur the old cant of “national identity,” and Papineau’s poison, though driven underground, bubbles in every parish.  We have shattered their battalions but not their convictions.\n\nThe root of the evil is unchanged: the French majority, coddled by the Quebec Act, cherishes the illusion that this country can be governed in a tongue the rest of the Empire neither speaks nor understands.  They demand that their language stand beside ours in every statute, every court, every ledger.  Grant that, and tomorrow they will claim the Assembly, the Council, the revenues—aye, the very sword of command.  We of the Château Clique have fought seven years to keep the levers in loyal hands; if we yield an inch the whole machine slips to them by weight of numbers.\n\nYou ask whether Durham’s coming cheers me.  I confess no great hope.  His lordship’s ear is already filled by the whining of the defeated, and his humane temper shrinks from the stern measures victory demands.  A lenient report will but embolden the malcontents; a united Canada with responsible government means, in plain English, French domination through their majority.  Better the suspended constitution we now rule by proclamation than such a surrender.\n\nYet we must not appear obstinate.  My proposal is to press the Governor to divide the Province.  Let the Ottawa be the frontier: eastward, the old French colony may keep its seigneuries and its priests; westward, we loyal Britons shall build new counties, English in tongue, in law, and in loyalty.  Thus we save the Empire the cost of perpetual coercion, and leave the habitants to their own inertia.\n\nKeep this letter close; burn it if danger hovers.  The mails are watched, and even in our Council-chamber I trust no man’s silence absolutely.  If you can add your voice to mine before Durham lands, do so.  We have beaten the rebels in the field; we must now beat them in the dispatch-box, or all our victories are but a breathing-space.\n\nYours in the King’s service,  \n——",
