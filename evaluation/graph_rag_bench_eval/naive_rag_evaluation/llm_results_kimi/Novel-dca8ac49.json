  "gold_answer": "Launce’s Diary: The day was peaceful until a boat, with John Curgenven aboard, entered our cave. The water stirred as the boat’s shadow passed over us. The other fishes, always chasing me, seemed distracted by the newcomers. I kept close to the rocks at Lizard, wary of both humans and my fellow fish.",

Not the moon-feet children with their crooked spears and fire-smells, but the big wooden beast that coughs and bleeds black water. It nosed into my cave—*my* cave—where I hide when the moon is too bright and the tide too low. I was curled in the green-dark, tail tucked under a ridge of stone, dreaming of shrimp. Then came the *thump-thump* of oars, the shiver of water, and their shadows fell across the roof like predatory gulls.\n\nI froze. We all froze—my cousins half-buried in the sand, the pipefish clinging to the wall like striped quills. Even the blind prawns stopped their frantic dance. The boat-beast stopped too, right where the light dies and the tunnel narrows to a throat. A hush, then *BOOM!* A thunderclap inside stone. The cave screamed back, the sound rolling over itself like waves stacked tall. My heart beat in my gills. They do this—fire their noise-stick to hear the cave roar. As if the cave were a conch they could blow. As if we were not inside it, trembling.\n\nLight spilled—white, unnatural. One of them held a sun in their hand, a small cruel sun they could switch on and off. It found the silver on my flank; I felt it like a hook. I dove deeper, sand exploding around me in a storm. Others fled too—launce, young blennies, a velvet crab who left one claw behind in his panic. The water thickened with our fear.\n\nThey stayed only a dozen heartbeats, though it felt like a tide-cycle. Laughed, even. One voice—soft, female—said, “Give me but five, nay, two minutes more!” as if the cave were a fair-booth and we the painted prizes. Then the boat-beast turned, drank the light back into itself, and drifted out. The darkness returned, bruised and ringing.\n\nWe waited until the ripples from their oars became the normal pulse of the sea. Slowly, cousins re-emerged, peppered with sand like seasoning. I wrote this in the silt with my tail, then erased it with a flick. Let no record remain for the next intruders. The cave is ours again—until the moon swells and the thunder-boat returns.\n\nTonight I will burrow deeper, below the reach of light and noise. Let them have the open water. The cave keeps its own silence, and we keep its secrets.",

You are apt either to chop him right in two, or miss him altogether, when off he wriggles in the sand and disappears. My young people say it requires a practised hand and a peculiar twist of the wrist, to have any success at all in launce fishing. It can only be done on moonlight nights--the full moon and a day or two after--and they are out half the night. They go about barefoot, which is much safer than soaked shoes and stockings. About midnight they light a fire on the sand, cook all the fish they have caught, and have a grand supper, as they had last night. They came home as merry as crickets about two o'clock this morning. Perhaps you might not have noticed what a wonderful moonlight night it was?\" I had; but it would not have occurred to me to spend it in standing for hours up to the knees in salt water, catching unfortunate fish. However, tastes differ, and launce-fishing may be a prime delight to some people; so I faithfully chronicle it, and the proper mode of pursuing it, as one of the attractions at the Lizard. I am not aware that it is practised at any other part",

They have been bathing, and are now going to walk to Cadgwith.\" \"Then nobody fell into the Devil's Throat at Kynance? They all came back to you with whole limbs?\" \"Yes,\" said he smiling, \"and they went again for another long walk in the afternoon. At night, when it turned out to be such splendid moonlight, they actually insisted on going launce-fishing. Of course you know about launce-fishing?\" I pleaded my utter ignorance of that noble sport. \"Oh, it is _the_ thing at the Lizard. My boys--and girls too--consider it the best fun going. The launce is a sort of sand-eel peculiar to these coasts. It swims about all day, and at night burrows in the sand just above the waterline, where, when the moon shines on it, you can trace the silvery gleam of the creature. So you stand up to your ankles on wet sand, with a crooked iron spear which you dart in and hook him up, keeping your left hand free to seize him with.\" \"Easy",

Its only floor is of heaving water, a deep olive green, and so clear that we could see the fishes swimming about pursuing a shoal of launce. Its high-vaulted roof and sides were tinted all colours--rose-pink, rich dark brown, and purple. The entrance was wide enough to admit a boat, but it gradually narrowed into impenetrable darkness. How far inland it goes no one can tell, as it could only be investigated by swimming, a rather dangerous experiment. Boats venture as far as the daylight goes; and it is a favourite trick of the boatman suddenly to fire off a pistol, which reverberates like thunder through the mysterious gloom of the cave. A solemn place; an awful place, some of us thought, as we rowed in, and out again, into the sunshiny open sea. Which we had now got used to; and it was delicious to go dancing like a feather up and down, trusting to John Curgenven's stout arm and fearless, honest face. We felt sad to think this would be our last sight of him and of the magnificent Lizard coast. But the minutes were lessening, and we had some way still to row. Also to land, which meant a leap between the waves upon slippery sea-weedy rocks. In silent dread I watched my children accomplish this feat, and then--",

Hold on, mate, the boat will go right into the cave.\" And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them; while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from which no one could ever hope to come out alive. \"I don't like this at all,\" said a small voice. \"Hadn't we better get out again?\" practically suggested another. But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to return; and begged for \"only five minutes\" in that wonderful place, compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as nothing. They were beautiful, but this was terrible. Yet with its terror was mingled an awful delight. \"Give me but five, nay, two minutes more!\" \"Very well, just as you",

And you'll find a capital tea waiting for you; there isn't a more comfortable inn in all Cornwall.\" Which, we afterwards found, was saying a great deal. Mullion Cove is a good mile from Mullion village, and as we jolted over the rough road I was remorseful over both carriage and horse. \"Not at all, ma'am, he's used to it. Often and often he comes here with pic-nic parties, all the way from Falmouth. I'll put him in at the farm, and be down with you at the Cove directly. You'll find the rocks pretty bad walking, but there's a cave which you ought to see. We'll try it.\" There was no resisting the way the kindly young Cornishman thus identified himself with our interests, and gave himself all sorts of extra trouble on our account. And when after a steep and not too savoury descent--the cove being used as a fish cellar--we found ourselves on the beach, shut in by those grand rocks of serpentine, with Mullion Island lying ahead about a quarter of a mile off, we felt we had not come here for nothing.
