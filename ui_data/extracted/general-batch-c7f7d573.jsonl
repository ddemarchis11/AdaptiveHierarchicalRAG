1\n \n8\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(Unaudited)  \nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAccounting Principles \nOur unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with \naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, the unaudited \ninterim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a \nfair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results \nfor a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the \nMicrosoft Corporation fiscal year 2025 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 30, \n2025.\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts on our consolidated cash flows statements to conform to the current \nperiod presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, \nconsolidated income statements, or net cash from (used in) operations, investing, or financing on our consolidated \ncash flows statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany \ntransactions and balances have been eliminated. \nEstimates and Assumptions \nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue \nrecognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the \nstandalone selling price of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product \nreturns and refunds; loss contingencies; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets \nfor our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful \naccounts; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the \npotential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax \nreturns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ \nfrom management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of \npurchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, \ninvestments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are \nclassified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term \nbased on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is \navailable for current operations.\n17/02/26, 11:32 10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312526027207/msft-20251231.htm 8/68\nPART I\nItem 1\n \n9\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific \nidentification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other \ncomprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates \ndetermined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, \ngeneral market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than \ncost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and \nqualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business \noutlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell \nthe security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other \nincome (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee \nconditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are generally measured at fair value. Equity investments that \nare not recorded at fair value are measured using the equity method of accounting when required or measured at cost \nwith adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). For \nequity investments recorded at fair value, we perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an \nimpairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in \nfair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Equity method investments may be recorded on a lag of up to \nthree months when sufficient financial information is not available in a timely manner. For equity method investments \nrecorded on a lag, we recognize the impact of intervening events that have a material impact on our consolidated \nfinancial statements in the period in which they occurred. \nInvestments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are evaluated to determine whether we are the \nprimary beneficiary of the VIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether we \nhave (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the \nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \nWe have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments \nare not consolidated and the majority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. \nWe have a long-term strategic partnership with OpenAI. In October 2025, we signed a new definitive agreement with \nOpenAI that extends this partnership. Additionally, OpenAI formed a public benefit corporation and completed a \nrecapitalization (“OpenAI Recapitalization”). We have an investment of approximately 27 percent of OpenAI on an as-\nconverted basis accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the OpenAI Recapitalization, we \nhad a decrease in our proportionate ownership of OpenAI and recorded a dilution gain in other income (expense), net. \nRefer to Note 3 – Other Income (Expense), Net for additional information. We calculate our equity method income or \nloss using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method because our liquidation rights and priorities differ \nfrom our underlying ownership interest. Under the HLBV method, we recognize income or loss based on the change in \nthe amount we would receive if the net assets of the investee were distributed at book value. We have made total \nfunding commitments of $13 billion, of which $11.7 billion has been funded as of December 31, 2025.\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for \nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income \n(expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components \nexcluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of \nother comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding \nhedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are \nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are \nprimarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\n17/02/26, 11:32 10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312526027207/msft-20251231.htm 9/68\nPART I\nItem 1\n \n10\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on \nthe extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair \nvalue measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n•Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our \nLevel 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. \nOur Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.\n•Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. \nthe Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated \nby observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these \nmodels project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based \nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and \nspot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. \nagency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and \nbonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap \ncontracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\n•Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions \nthat market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined \nusing model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level \n3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill \nand intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable \ninputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of \nthese investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include \nquoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nContract Balances and Other Receivables \nAs of December 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, \nwas $5.3 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance \nsheets.\nAs of December 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server \ncomponents were $15.1 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our \nconsolidated balance sheets.\nWe record financing receivables when we offer certain customers the option to acquire our software products and \nservices offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of December 31, 2025 and June 30, \n2025, our financing receivables, net were $2.7 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term \nfinancing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated \nbalance sheets. \nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of credit losses inherent in the accounts \nreceivable and financing receivable balances. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, \nhistorical experience, and other currently available evidence.\n17/02/26, 11:32 10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312526027207/msft-20251231.htm 10/68\nPART I\nItem 1\n \n11\nRecent Accounting Guidance\nIncome Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard to improve income tax \ndisclosures. The guidance requires additional disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid and prescribes \nstandardized categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation. We will adopt the standard on the \neffective date in our annual reporting for fiscal year 2026. The standard can be applied either prospectively or \nretrospectively. \nIncome Statement – Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued a new standard to expand disclosures about income statement expenses. The \nguidance requires disaggregation of certain costs and expenses included in each relevant expense caption on our \nconsolidated income statements in a separate note to the financial statements at each interim and annual reporting \nperiod, including amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset \namortization. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2028 and interim \nperiods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our \ndisclosures. \nNOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock \noutstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common \nstock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock \nmethod. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. \nThe components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:  \n(In millions, except per share amounts)  \nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,   \nSix Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n               \n               \n  2025  2024   2025   2024               \nNet income available for common shareholders (A)  $38,458  $24,108  $66,205  $48,775                  \n                 \nWeighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B)  7,431   7,435   7,432   7,434 \nDilutive effect of stock-based awards   29   33   31   35                  \n                 \nCommon stock and common stock equivalents (C)   7,460   7,468   7,463   7,469                  \n                 \nEarnings Per Share                                  \nBasic (A/B)  $ 5.18  $ 3.24  $ 8.91  $ 6.56 \nDiluted (A/C)  $ 5.16  $ 3.23  $ 8.87  $ 6.53                  \n \nAnti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods \npresented.\n17/02/26, 11:32 10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312526027207/msft-20251231.htm 11/68\nPART I\nItem 1\n \n12\nNOTE 3 — OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET \nThe components of other income (expense), net were as follows: \n(In millions)  \nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,   \nSix Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n               \n               \n  2025  2024   2025   2024               \nInterest and dividends income  $ 840  $ 600  $1,816  $1,281 \nInterest expense   (736)  (594)  (1,434)  (1,176) \nNet recognized gains (losses) on investments   339   (860)  (233)  (397) \nNet gains (losses) on derivatives   37   (116)  1,616   (454)\nNet gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements   (50)  (153)  (72)  23 \nOther, net   9,541   (1,165)  4,618   (1,848)                 \n                 \nTotal  $ 9,971  $ (2,288) $6,311  $(2,571)                  \n \nOther income (expense), net included $10.0 billion and $5.9 billion of net gains for the three and six months ended \nDecember 31, 2025, respectively, and $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion of net losses for the three and six months ended \nDecember 31, 2024, respectively, from investments in OpenAI, primarily net recognized gains (losses) on our equity \nmethod investment reflected in Other, net.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include \nreducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our \nderivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. \nForeign Currencies \nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign \ncurrency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. \n17/02/26, 11:32 10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312526027207/msft-20251231.htm 15/68\nPART I\nItem 1\n \n16\nForeign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts \nthat are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign \nexchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. \nInterest Rate \nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair \nvalue hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We \nmanage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-\nbased fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging \ninstruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.\nEquity \nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, \nfutures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.\nCredit \nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default \nswap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. \nThese contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features \nCertain counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding \nlong-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of \n$1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the \nstandard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of December 31, 2025, our long-term unsecured debt \nrating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be \nposted. \nThe following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S. dollar \nequivalents: \n(In

The increase in our effective tax rate for the three and six months \nended December 31, 2025 compared to the prior year was primarily due to deferred tax expense attributable to the \ndilution gain from the OpenAI Recapitalization and changes in the mix of our earnings and tax expenses between the \nU.S. and foreign countries.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three and six months ended December 31, \n2025, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our \nproducts and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of December 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025, unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities were $28.7 \nbillion and $27.4 billion, respectively, and are included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on \nSeptember 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the \nNOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 \nbillion plus penalties and interest. As of December 31, 2025, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies \nare adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s \nadministrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues \nin the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or \ndecrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. \nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S., some of which are currently under audit by local \ntax authorities. The resolution of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. \nOur operations in Ireland remain subject to examination for tax years 2021 and thereafter.\nNOTE 11 — UNEARNED REVENUE \nUnearned revenue by segment was as follows:  \n(In millions)              \n   \n  \nDecember 31,\n2025  \nJune 30,\n2025    \nProductivity and Business Processes  $ 39,721  $ 50,567 \nIntelligent Cloud   11,433   14,022 \nMore Personal Computing   2,890   2,676          \n         \nTotal  $ 54,044  $ 67,265          \n \nChanges in unearned revenue were as follows:  \n(In millions)      \n  \nSix Months Ended December 31, 2025    \nBalance, beginning of period  $ 67,265 \nDeferral of revenue   89,010 \nRecognition of unearned revenue   (102,231)  \n     \nBalance, end of period  $ 54,044      \n \n17/02/26, 11:32 10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312526027207/msft-20251231.htm 22/68\nPART I\nItem 1\n \n22\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts expected to \nbe invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $631 billion as of December 31, 2025. Estimating \nrevenue that will be allocated to remaining performance obligations can involve significant judgments, including \nidentifying and assessing variable consideration and potential renegotiation of commitments. We consider factors such \nas the nature of the terms and duration of the contract across our portfolio of contracts. Revenue allocated to remaining \nperformance obligations related to the commercial portion of revenue was $625 billion as of December 31, 2025, with a \nweighted average duration of approximately 2.5 years. We expect to recognize approximately 25% of both our total \ncompany remaining performance obligation revenue and commercial remaining performance obligation revenue over \nthe next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.\nNOTE 12 — LEASES\nWe have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, \nMicrosoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment.

While we intend to defend these \nmatters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $400 million in aggregate beyond \nrecorded amounts are reasonably possible.

The \nCODM uses operating income to allocate resources during our annual planning process and throughout the year, as \nwell as to assess the performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results compared to prior periods \nand expected results. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following \nsegments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.\n17/02/26, 11:32 10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312526027207/msft-20251231.htm 27/68\nPART I\nItem 1\n \n26\nOur reportable segments are described below.\nProductivity and Business Processes\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, \ncommunication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily \ncomprises:\n•Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud, \ncomprising Microsoft 365 Commercial, Enterprise Mobility + Security, the cloud portion of Windows \nCommercial, the per-user portion of Power BI, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 \nSecurity and Compliance, and Microsoft 365 Copilot; and Microsoft 365 Commercial products, comprising \nWindows Commercial on-premises and Office licensed on-premises. \n•Microsoft 365 Consumer products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, \nOffice licensed on-premises, and other consumer services.\n•LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.\n•Dynamics products and cloud services, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based \napplications across ERP, CRM, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM \napplications.\nIntelligent Cloud\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that power \nmodern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n•Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services, comprising cloud and AI \nconsumption-based services, GitHub cloud services, Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop \nofferings, and other cloud services; and Server products, comprising SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual \nStudio, System Center, related Client Access Licenses, and other on-premises offerings.\n•Enterprise and partner services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, Nuance \nprofessional services, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.\nMore Personal Computing\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the \nexperience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:\n•Windows and Devices, including Windows OEM licensing (Windows Pro and non-Pro licenses sold through \nthe OEM channel) and Devices, comprising Surface and PC accessories.\n•Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content \n(including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, \nadvertising, and other cloud services.\n•Search and news advertising, comprising Bing and Copilot, Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party \naffiliates.\nRevenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our \nbusiness, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from \ncertain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, \nwhich can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a \nprofit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating \nexpenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple \nsegments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.\n17/02/26, 11:32 10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312526027207/msft-20251231.htm 28/68\nPART I\nItem 1\n \n27\nIn addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs \ngenerally include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise \ntaxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, and severance incurred as part of a \ncorporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs \nbeing allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount.\nSegment revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and operating income were as follows during the periods \npresented: \n(In millions)  \nThree Months Ended \nDecember 31,   \nSix Months Ended \nDecember 31,\n \n                 \n                 \n   2025   2024   2025   2024                  \nProductivity and Business Processes                                  \nRevenue  $34,116  $29,437  $67,136  $57,754 \nCost of revenue   6,110   5,569   11,831   10,863 \nOperating expenses   7,407   6,983   14,299   13,490                  \n                 \nOperating income  $20,599  $16,885  $41,006  $33,401                  \n                 \nIntelligent Cloud                                  \nRevenue  $32,907  $25,544  $63,804  $49,636 \nCost of revenue   13,566   9,405   25,880   18,019 \nOperating expenses   5,468   5,288   10,660   10,263                  \n                 \nOperating income  $13,873  $10,851  $27,264  $21,354                  \n                 \nMore Personal Computing                                  \nRevenue  $14,250  $14,651  $28,006  $27,827 \nCost of revenue   6,302   6,825   12,310   13,016 \nOperating expenses   4,145   3,909   7,730   7,361                  \n                 \nOperating income  $ 3,803  $ 3,917  $ 7,966  $ 7,450                  \n                 \nTotal                                  \nRevenue  $81,273  $69,632  $158,946  $135,217 \nCost of revenue   25,978   21,799   50,021   41,898 \nOperating expenses   17,020   16,180   32,689   31,114                  \n                 \nOperating income  $38,275  $31,653  $76,236  $62,205                  \n \nNo sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue for \nthe three or six months ended December 31, 2025 or 2024.

Based on our reviews, \nwe are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial \ninformation for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of \nAmerica. \nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight \nBoard (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2025, and the \nrelated consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for the \nyear then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 30, 2025, we expressed an unqualified \nopinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying \nconsolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2025, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the \nconsolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. \nBasis for Review Results\nThis interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting \nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance \nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information \nconsists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial \nand accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards \nof the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as \na whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\n \n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n \nSeattle, Washington\nJanuary 28, 2026\n17/02/26, 11:32 10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312526027207/msft-20251231.htm 31/68\nPART I\nItem 2\n \n30\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNote About Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected \noperating results that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform \nAct of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. \nForward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including the following sections: “Management’s \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” (Part II, Item 1A of this \nForm 10-Q). These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” \n“anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will \ncontinue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations \nand assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We \ndescribe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially in “Management’s \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures \nAbout Market Risk” (Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-Q), and “Risk Factors”. We undertake no obligation to update or \nrevise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is \nintended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. \nMD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \nyear ended June 30, 2025, and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial \nStatements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).\nOVERVIEW\nMicrosoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence (“AI”) available \nbroadly and doing so responsibly, with a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to \nachieve more. We create platforms and tools, powered by AI, that deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving \nneeds of our customers. \nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and \nbusinesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global \naudience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; \nsupporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, \nmarketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.\nHighlights from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared with the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 included:\n•Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 26% to $51.5 billion.\n•Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 110% to $625 billion.\n•Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 17%.\n•Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue increased 29%. \n•LinkedIn revenue increased 11%.\n•Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19%.\n•Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 39%.\n•Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 1%.\n•Xbox content and services revenue decreased 5%.\n•Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 10%.\n17/02/26, 11:32 10-Q\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312526027207/msft-20251231.htm 32/68\nPART I\nItem 2\n \n31\nIndustry Trends and Opportunities\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each \nindustry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the \nindustry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research \nand development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry \ntrends, and competitive forces.\nWe have a long-term strategic partnership with OpenAI which was originally established in 2019. In October 2025, we \nsigned a new definitive agreement with OpenAI that extends this partnership and continues to build on our shared \nvision to advance artificial intelligence responsibly and make its benefits broadly accessible. Microsoft is a major \ninvestor in OpenAI, and the companies have reciprocal revenue-sharing arrangements. We hold rights to OpenAI’s \nintellectual property, including models and infrastructure, for integration into our products. \nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are \ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and \nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in \nthe cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for \nour software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain \ndynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs \nand may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter \nlocations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing \ndemand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, \nnetworking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units and other components. Our devices are primarily \nmanufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other \nmanufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our \nproducts contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these \nsuppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and \nindustry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, \nbroad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and \nbusinesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue \nand expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates \nmay significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies \nincreased reported revenue and did not have a material impact on reported expenses from our international operations \nfor the three and six months ended December 31, 2025.\nFurther, global, regional, and local economic developments and changes in global trade policies such as restrictions on \ninternational trade, including tariffs and other controls on imports or exports, could result in increased supply chain \nchallenges, cost volatility, and consumer and economic uncertainty which may adversely affect our results of \noperations.\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.
