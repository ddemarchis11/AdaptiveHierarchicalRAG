The College of Coastal Georgia Mariners from Brunswick spent 2010–2011 in the GCAA before moving to the NAIA Division I Southern States Athletic Conference, the same destination later chosen by the Macon-based Middle Georgia State Knights after their 2010–2014 tenure. Young Harris Mountain Lions exited after one season, stepping up to NCAA Division II and the Peach Belt Conference. Middle Georgia Technical Titans of Warner Robins and Waycross Swamp Foxes both remained through 2013, then respectively consolidated with Central Georgia Technical College and South Georgia State College. Georgia Perimeter Jaguars from Decatur stayed until 2015 before merging into Georgia State University, while Albany’s Darton Cavaliers and Marietta’s Chattahoochee Tech Eagles both competed through 2016, after which Darton consolidated with Albany State and Chattahoochee Tech dropped sports. Georgia Northwestern Bobcats of Rome and North Georgia Wolves of Clarkesville stayed in the league indefinitely before each discontinued intercollegiate competition.
