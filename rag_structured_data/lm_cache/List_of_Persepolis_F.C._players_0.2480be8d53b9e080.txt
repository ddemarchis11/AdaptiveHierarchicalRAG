Aziz Asli guarded Persepolis’s goal from 1968 to 1971, sharing the keeper role with Hadi Tavoosi, who served two spells, 1968-69 and 1970-74. Hamid Shirzadegan led the attack from 1968 to 1974, while defenders Ebrahim Ashtiani, Büyük Vatankhah, Jafar Kashani and Reza Vatankhah each returned after the 1969 hiatus to anchor the back line until 1976, 1974, 1975 and 1980 respectively. Forwards Nazem Ganjapour and Hossein Kalani, plus midfielder Fereydoun Moeini, mirrored that split-career pattern, rejoining after 1969 and staying through 1972, 1975 and 1976. Mahmoud Khordbin, already aboard in 1969, stayed a full decade through 1980. Homayoun Behzadi, Mehrab Shahrokhi, Safar Iranpak and Esmaeil Haj Rahimipour all signed in 1970 and remained until 1975 or 1978, while Ali Parvin, arriving the same year, became a club legend with an 18-year midfield tenure ending in 1988. Iraj Soleimani and Mohammad Reza Khalatbari joined in 1971 and left in 1975 and 1978, Bahram Mavaddat kept goal from 1973 to 1976, and Javad Allahverdi patrolled the defence from 1974 to 1981.
