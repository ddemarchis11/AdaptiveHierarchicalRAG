EcoRI from Escherichia coli reads 5'-GAATTC-3' and severs after the G, while its sibling EcoRII targets 5'-CCWGG-3' without offset. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens supplies BamHI, which clips between G and GATCC within 5'-GGATCC-3', and Haemophilus influenzae contributes two enzymes: HindIII, nicking AAGCTT after the first A, and HinFI, cutting GANTC between G and ANTC. Thermus aquaticus yields TaqI, splitting 5'-TCGA-3' after T, whereas Nocardia otitidis provides NotI, severing GCGGCCGC between GC and GGCCGC. Staphylococcus aureus offers Sau3AI, slicing straight through 5'-GATC-3'. Proteus vulgaris PvuII and Serratia marcescens SmaI both generate blunt ends, the former cleaving CAGCTG between CAG and CTG, the latter bisecting CCCGGG between CCC and GGG. Haemophilus aegyptius HaeIII cuts 5'-GGCC-3' in the middle, Arthrobacter luteus AluI severs AGCT between AG and CT, and Escherichia coli EcoRV opens GATATC between GAT and ATC. Escherichia coli also produces the Type III enzyme EcoP15I, which recognizes asymmetric 5'-CAGCAGN25NN-3'. Klebsiella pneumoniae KpnI clips GGTACC after T, Providencia stuartii PstI cuts CTGCAG after A, Streptomyces achromogenes SacI severs GAGCTC after T, Streptomyces albus SalI cuts GTCGAC after T, and Streptomyces caespitosus ScaI opens AGTACT between AGT and ACT.
