In April 1995, TV1 handed a fresh free-to-air run to a wave of vintage favourites: The A-Team, Friday the 13th: The Series, TJ Hooker and The Jeffersons all resurfaced on Network Ten (the latter two under the old Channel 0 branding), while Battlestar Galactica and The Incredible Hulk docked at the Seven Network and Benson, B. J. and the Bear, Fonz and the Happy Days Gang, Knight Rider, McHale’s Navy, Miami Vice and Webster migrated to the Nine Network; Dennis the Menace (1959) was shared by Seven, Nine and Ten. The same month, TV1 also kept The Bionic Woman, Dragnet, Gimme a Break! and She Wolf of London exclusive to its own schedule. Later, on 7 August, Max gave Twinkle the Dream Being its Australian television encore.
