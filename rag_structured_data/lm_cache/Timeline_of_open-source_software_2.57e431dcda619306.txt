In 1991 Linus Torvalds started the Linux kernel, whose source code released that same year would expand from a few commercially restricted C files to 290 MB under the GNU GPL by 2007, while Guido van Rossum first released Python. The next year Lynne and William Jolitz began public 386BSD releases, Andrew Tridgell wrote the initial Samba at the Australian National University, and frustration over 386BSD’s direction led Chris Demetriou, Theo de Raadt, Adam Glass and Charles Hannum to launch NetBSD in March 1993. December 1993 brought FreeBSD 1.0, Bob Amstadt and Eric Youngdale started Wine to run Windows programs on Linux, and the first Linux Journal appeared in March 1994. Rasmus Lerdorf’s PHP reached the public in June 1995, the same year Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis created the General Image Manipulation Program and Yukihiro Matsumoto released Ruby, later popularized by Ruby on Rails. Robert McCool’s Apache web server debuted in 1996 alongside Matthias Ettrich’s KDE, Miguel de Icaza and Federico Mena founded GNOME in August 1997, and Sun Microsystems bought StarOffice in 1999, freeing its code as OpenOffice.org that August and dual-licensing it under LGPL and SISSL on 19 July 2000.
