Christine Baranski’s screen career began with bit parts: in 1982 she was the blonde in the bar in Soup for One, and the following year she played a nymphomaniac in Lovesick. She stepped up to named roles as Maxine in 1984’s Crackers, then as Thea in 9½ Weeks and Carol Freeman in Legal Eagles, both released in 1986. After portraying Harriet in 1987’s The Pick-up Artist, she took the real-life part of Andrea Reynolds in 1990’s Reversal of Fortune. 1993 brought three turns: Lucy in The Night We Never Met, Carol in Life with Mikey, and Becky Martin-Granger in Addams Family Values. She spent 1994 juggling Connie Chasseur in The Ref, Mrs. Margaret Maggie Higgs in Getting In, and Miss Strapford in The War. A 1995 prosecutor in New Jersey Drive preceded her Ann Marwood Bartle in Jeffrey. She then appeared as Katherine Archer in 1996’s The Birdcage, Thelma in 1998’s The Odd Couple II, and Constance Bulworth in Bulworth the same year. She closed the decade as Bunny Caldwell in Cruel Intentions and Carol once more in Bowfinger, both 1999 releases.
