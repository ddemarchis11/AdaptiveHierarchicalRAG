Convoy ON 67, which sailed from Liverpool on 14 February 1942, comprised twenty merchant vessels. The 7,984-GRT British freighter Adellen, built in 1930, was torpedoed and sunk by U-155 on 22 February, while the 8,009-GRT British Anadara, launched in 1935, succumbed to combined fire from U-558 and U-587 two days later. Norway’s 8,325-GRT Belinda, completed in 1939, continued safely toward the West Indies, as did the 4,847-GRT British Consuelo, bound for New York City and already a veteran of convoy HX 228. Cristales, a 5,389-GRT British ship from 1926, carried Convoy Vice-Commodore Captain R H R MacKay OBE toward Halifax but collided on 24 February. Daghestan and Empire Spray, both 1941-built CAM ships of 7,248 and 7,242 GRT respectively, also headed for Halifax, while the Soviet 7,363-GRT Dekabrist, dating from 1903, steamed for New York. The 8,146-GRT British Diloma, damaged by U-158, nevertheless reached Halifax, and the 8,142-GRT Dolabella and 8,036-GRT Dromus both shaped course for Curaçao. Empire Druid, Empire Steel, Empire, and Empire Celt—modern 1941 British ships of 9,813, 8,138, 8,134, and 8,032 GRT—were routed to Port Arthur, Baton Rouge, and Port Arthur respectively; Empire Celt was sunk by U-158 on 24 February. That same day, the Norwegian 9,432-GRT Eidanger and 9,551-GRT Finnanger, both built in the late 1930s, were also sunk by U-558. The 6,409-GRT Norwegian Glittre, bound for Aruba, survived only to be lost a year later in convoy ON 166, while the 3,071-GRT British Gloucester City, launched in 1919, made for Philadelphia, and the 6,578-GRT Norwegian Hamlet joined the convoy from Iceland on 19 February.
