In 1960 Dick Hyde played trombone on Ann Richards and Stan Kenton’s Capitol jazz-pop album “Two Much!”. Six years later he supplied the same horn for Nancy Sinatra’s Reprise set “Sugar”, and in 1967 doubled on trombone and tuba for Ian Whitcomb’s rock outing “Yellow Underground” on Tower while also blowing trombone for Harpers Bizarre’s Warner Bros. pop-rock release “Feelin’ Groovy”. 1968 found him switching to woodwinds for Van Dyke Parks’ “Song Cycle” and returning to trombone for Mason Williams’ “The Mason Williams Phonograph Record”, both on Warner Bros. The next year he contributed trombone to the multi-genre “Fused” by The Mike Post Coalition, Bob Jung’s big-band “Jung! : The Big Band Syndrome” on Command, Bugsy’s pop-rock “Inside Bugsy” on Dot, and Blue Mitchell’s funky “Collision in Black” on Blue Note. Hyde’s 1970s sessions began with trombone on David Axelrod’s jazz-rock “Earth Rot” for Capitol and Neil Diamond’s rock opus “Tap Root Manuscript” on Uni, followed by Chet Baker’s Verve jazz set “Blood, Chet and Tears”. He then played trombone on Rita Coolidge’s 1971 A&M album “Rita Coolidge”, Dory Previn’s folk-country “Reflections in a Mud Puddle” on United Artists, and David Axelrod’s jazz-funk “The Auction” on Decca. In 1972 he shifted to horn for Henry Mancini’s RCA Victor soundtrack “Music from the TV Series: The Mancini Generation”, and in 1973 supplied horn for Arlo Guthrie’s “Gypsy Davy” track on “Last of the Brooklyn Cowboys”, Cheech & Chong’s comedy-rock “Los Cochinos” on Ode, and trombone for Claudia Lennear’s funk-soul “Phew” on Warner Bros.
