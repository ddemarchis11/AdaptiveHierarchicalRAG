Stephen Gilbert’s 1968 horror novel Ratman’s Notebooks gives us two rats: Ben, the menacing star who reappears in both Willard films, and the white Socrates, befriended and exploited for evil. Terry Pratchett’s near-blind albino guru Dangerous Beans alone resists Spider’s mind control in The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents, while China Miéville’s fallen monarch King Rat, father of Saul, wages centuries of war with the Piper. Eduard Uspenskiy tucks Lariska, Old Lady Shapoklyak’s purse-dwelling pet, into the Cheburashka tales, and W. H. Beck’s class-pet Malcolm redeems his “menace” reputation by rescuing a kidnapped iguana in Malcolm at Midnight. Frances Hodgson Burnett’s Sara Crewe nicknames the domestic rat Melchisedec her “Bastille rat” during her servitude at Miss Minchin’s Seminary, and Robert C. O’Brien appoints the wise Nicodemus leader of the scientifically enhanced rats of NIMH. Eve Titus pits Basil of Baker Street against the master-criminal Professor Ratigan, Jules Verne sends the heroic Ratine to break the evil magician Gardafour’s spells, and Lynne Jonell gives Emmy the comforting, power-wielding Ratty. Suzanne Collins supplies Ripred, the giant gnawer who commands the rat resistance in The Underland Chronicles, while Beatrix Potter’s Samuel Whiskers and Anna Maria nearly turn Tom Kitten into a roly-poly pudding. J. K. Rowling’s Scabbers lounges in Ron Weasley’s pocket, Louisa May Alcott’s March girls keep the pet rat Scrabble, and E. B. White’s barnyard gourmand Templeton begrudgingly aids Wilbur. Barbara Wersba’s literate Walter courts the like-minded Miss Pomeroy, and Paul Zindel’s white pet Surfer becomes the music-and-dance-loving leader of mutant rats. Finally, Cameron Stelzer renames circus escapee Wentworth Winterbottom as Whisker when he joins Captain Black Rat’s Pie Rat crew aboard the Apple Pie.
