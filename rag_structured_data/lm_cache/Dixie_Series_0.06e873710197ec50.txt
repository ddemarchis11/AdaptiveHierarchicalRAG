Fort Worth dominated the Dixie Series’ first decade, claiming the 1920 title 4-2-1 over Little Rock Travelers and repeating in 1921 against Memphis Chicks. After Mobile Bears briefly interrupted with a 4-2-1 Southern Association triumph in 1922, Fort Worth reeled off three straight: 1923 over New Orleans Pelicans, 1924 over Memphis, and 1925 over Atlanta Crackers. Dallas Steers defeated New Orleans 4-2-1 in 1926, Wichita Falls Spudders swept the Pelicans in 1927, and Houston Buffaloes topped Birmingham Barons 4-2 in 1928, before Birmingham returned the favor against Dallas in 1929. Fort Worth resumed control in 1930, downing Memphis 4-1. Birmingham Barons reclaimed Southern pride in 1931, edging Houston 4-3, and Chattanooga Lookouts followed by ousting Beaumont Exporters 4-1 in 1932. New Orleans Pelicans then secured back-to-back crowns, 4-2 over San Antonio Missions in 1933 and 4-2 over Galveston Buccaneers in 1934. Oklahoma City Indians snapped the streak for the Texas League in 1935, 4-2 over Atlanta, before Tulsa Oilers blanked Birmingham 4-0 in 1936. Fort Worth Cats reappeared to beat Little Rock Travelers 4-1 in 1937 and outlasted Nashville Vols 4-3 in 1939, while Atlanta Crackers sandwiched a 4-0-1 victory over Beaumont Exporters in 1938.
