Akiruno in Tokyo writes its name in hiragana as あきる野市, while its full kanji forms 秋留野 and 阿伎留野 linger as historical variants. Ichikikushikino, Kagoshima’s いちき串木野市, keeps the hiragana prefix but matches its kanji 市来串木野 exactly. Higashikagawa, Kagawa’s 東かがわ市, inserts hiragana for “kagawa” where the kanji 東香川 renders the whole in characters. Higashimiyoshi, Tokushima’s 東みよし町, likewise uses hiragana for “miyoshi” against the full-kanji 東三好. Kinokawa, Wakayama’s 紀の川市, slips a hiragana “no” between the kanji elements of 紀之川. Minamiawaji, Hyōgo’s 南あわじ市, spells “awaji” in hiragana though the kanji 南淡路 supplies the traditional form. Izunokuni, Shizuoka’s 伊豆の国市, keeps the hiragana “no” where 伊豆之国 writes “country” in kanji. Fujimino, Saitama’s ふじみ野市, renders “fujimi” entirely in hiragana while 富士見野 preserves the kanji for “see” and “field.”
