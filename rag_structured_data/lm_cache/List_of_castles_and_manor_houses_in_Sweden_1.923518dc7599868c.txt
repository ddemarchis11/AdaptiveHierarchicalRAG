Carlsten Fortress, raised in 1667 on the rocky coast of Bohuslän, now welcomes visitors as a museum, while the slightly older Charlottenborg manor house from 1651 in Östergötland serves the same purpose. Charlottenlund Castle in Scania, built in 1849, remains a private home, as does Dagsnäs Castle in Västergötland, completed in 1874. The exotic Chinese Pavilion at Drottningholm, dating to 1769, and Christinehof Castle from 1740 in Scania are both museums, whereas Claestorp Castle in Södermanland, finished in 1754, operates as a hotel. Dalaborg, the 1304 fortress in Dalsland, stands today as a ruin, and 15th-century Djursholm Castle in Stockholm houses offices. Drottningholm Palace, begun in 1580 in Stockholm, functions as both private residence and museum. Dybäck Castle, a 14th-century Scania stronghold, is still privately owned. Edsberg Castle in Uppland, built in 1630, is now a school, as is 17th-century Ekebyholm Castle nearby. Ekenäs Castle in Östergötland, originating in the 15th century, is a museum, while Ekebyhov Castle from the 1670s in Uppland shares that role. Ekensholm Castle in Södermanland, erected in the 1820s, remains a private residence. Eketorp Fort on Öland, a 5th-century ringfort, survives as a museum ruin. Ekholmen Castle in Uppland, completed in 1857, and 17th-century Ekolsund Castle in the same province both serve as hotels, while Elghammar Castle in Södermanland, built in 1807, is a private home.
