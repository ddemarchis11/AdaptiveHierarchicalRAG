Giorgio Fieschi, Genovese Dean of the Sacred College and bishop of Albenga, held the cardinalatial see of Ostia e Velletri since Eugenius IV elevated him on 18 December 1439. On that same day the Greek humanists Isidore of Kiev, Latin Patriarch of Constantinople and administrator of Nicosia, and Bessarion of Nicea, protector of the Basilians and administrator of Mazara del Vallo and Pamplona, received the suburban sees of Sabina and Frascati. Joining them were the French Benedictine Guillaume d’Estouteville, archbishop of Rouen and protector of the Augustinians, the Castilian Dominican Juan de Torquemada, administrator of Palestrina and abbot of Subiaco, and the Venetian cardinal-nephew Pietro Barbo, bishop of Vicenza and archpriest of the Vatican Basilica. Nicholas V continued the series on 20 December 1448, promoting the Catalan Antonio de la Cerda, bishop of Lerida and administrator of Giovinazzo, the Roman Latino Orsini, administrator of Bari and archpriest of the Lateran, the French Alain de Coëtivy, bishop of Avignon and administrator of Nîmes and Dol, and the Bolognese cardinal-nephew Filippo Calandrini, bishop of Bologna. Callixtus III added his own circle in 1456: on 20 February the Catalan cardinal-nephew Luis Juan del Mila y Borja, administrator of Segorbe and legate in Bologna, and the Portuguese archbishop of Lisbon, Jaime de Portugal, administrator of Paphos; on 17 December the Castilian Juan de Mella, bishop of Zamora, the Milanese Giovanni Castiglione, bishop of Pavia, the Sienese humanist Enea Silvio Piccolomini, bishop of both Siena and Warmia, and the Neapolitan Giacomo Tebaldi, archbishop of Naples and camerlengo. Prospero Colonna, protodeacon since Martin V raised him on 24 May 1426, and Rodrigo Borgia, Catalan cardinal-nephew, vice-chancellor, administrator of Valencia and papal generalissimo, completed the electorate that chose Pius II.
