The FT, built from 1939-1945, paired 555 A units with 541 B units to deliver 2,700 hp through twin EMD 16-567 engines on a B-B+B-B wheel plan. In 1946 the F2 offered 1,350 hp from a single EMD 16-567B, with 74 A and 30 B units, while the longer F3 run of 1946-1949 raised output to 1,500 hp and totaled 1,111 A and 696 B units. The F7, produced 1949-1953, kept the 1,500 hp rating and 567B engine but grew to 2,366 A and 1,483 B units; its passenger variant FP7, built the same years, omitted B units and delivered 1,500 hp to 381 A units. The F9, 1953-1960, upgraded to the 567C for 1,750 hp and comprised 99 A and 156 B units, mirrored by the FP9 of 1954-1959 with 90 A units and 1,750 hp. Finally, the unique 1956-1960 FL9 used a B-A1A layout, could draw 660 V DC from third rail, and offered either 567C at 1,750 hp or 567D1 at 1,800 hp across 60 locomotives.
