Astrid Wirtenberger dominated the leaderboard, earning perfect 40s for her sparkling Foxtrot and Jive, plus top marks of 36 for Mambo and 34 for Samba, while her 33 in Waltz still kept her ahead. Alexandra Meissnitzer proved the season’s other standout, posting the highest Cha Cha Cha (37), Quickstep (36), Paso Doble (34) and Tango (39). Alfons Haider and Mirna Jukić jointly peaked at 33 for Rumba, and Haider later collected 32 for Viennese Waltz, yet he also sank to the Cha Cha Cha basement alongside Mirna Jukić with 23. Dieter Chmelar shouldered most of the low scores: 19 in Foxtrot and Samba, 15 in Jive, 17 in Quickstep and Waltz. Markus Wolfahrt bottomed out at 17 in both Rumba and Tango, Mike Galeli hit 25 in Viennese Waltz and 29 in Mambo with Alfons Haider, and Reinhard Nowak joined Chmelar at 17 in Quickstep.
