On 2 February 2011 Star Cinema opened the year with Chito S. Roño’s horror-comedy “Bulong,” pairing Vhong Navarro and Angelica Panganiban, followed five days later by Marilou Diaz-Abaya’s drama “Ikaw Ang Pag-ibig,” which united Jomari Yllana, Ina Feleo, Eddie Garcia, Marvin Agustin and Jaime Fabregas under Star Cinema and Unitel Productions. Valentine’s season brought GMA Films’ anthology “My Valentine Girls,” directed by Dominic Zapata, Andoy Ranay and Chris Martinez and starring Richard Gutierrez, Solenn Heussaff, Lovi Poe, Eugene Domingo, Rhian Ramos and Jillian Ward. March laughter came from Wenn V. Deramas’ Viva Films release “Who’s That Girl” with Anne Curtis, Luis Manzano and Eugene Domingo, and from Mae Cruz’s Star Cinema hit “Catch Me, I’m in Love” starring Gerald Anderson, Sarah Geronimo and Matteo Guidicelli. April stayed comic as Tony Y Reyes’ “Pak! Pak! My Dr. Kwak!” teamed Vic Sotto, Bea Alonzo, Pokwang, Zaijan Jaranilla and Xyriel Manabat via Star Cinema & MZet. Olivia M. Lamasan’s May romance “In the Name of Love” paired Angel Locsin and Aga Muhlach for Star Cinema, while Cathy Garcia-Molina’s June entry “Forever and a Day” matched Sam Milby and KC Concepcion. July doubled the fun: Chris Martinez’s “Temptation Island” gathered Marian Rivera, Heart Evangelista, Lovi Poe, Solenn Heussaff, Rufa Mae Quinto and John Lapus for Regal & GMA Films, and Soxie H. Topacio’s “The Adventures of Pureza” starred Melai Cantiveros and Jason Francisco via Star Cinema & SineScreen.
