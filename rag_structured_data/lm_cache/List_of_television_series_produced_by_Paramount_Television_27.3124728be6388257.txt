The Fugitive ran on ABC from 1963 to 1967 in partnership with United Artists Television, while The Invaders occupied the same network a year later, 1967-1968. Dan August followed on ABC for the 1970-1971 season, after which CBS launched Cannon, a 1971-1976 crime drama that Viacom later handled in syndication. ABC’s The Streets of San Francisco spanned 1972-1977, with Warner Bros. Television involved only on the pilot and first season. Over on CBS, Barnaby Jones solved cases from 1973 to 1980, Woodruff Productions stepping in for its last two seasons, and The Manhunter tracked fugitives across 1974-1975. ABC closed the 1970s with the single-season Caribe in 1975, Bert D’Angelo/Superstar in 1976—later syndicated by Viacom—and the 1976-1977 manhunt series Most Wanted. NBC entered the Quinn Martin stable in 1977 with Quinn Martin’s Tales of the Unexpected, continued with The Runaways (1978-1979) alongside New Vistas Productions, and ended the decade with A Man Called Sloane in 1979, again with Woodruff Productions.
