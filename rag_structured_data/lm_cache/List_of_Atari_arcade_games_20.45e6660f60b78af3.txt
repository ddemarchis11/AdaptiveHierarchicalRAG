T-Mek, a 1994 four-player 3D vehicular combat title, put gamers inside MEK war machines to blast one another, while back in 1974 Tank let two tank commanders duel simultaneously, followed by Tank II in 1975 and the eight-player Tank 8 of 1976, the first Atari arcade board ever to carry its own CPU. Tempest arrived in 1980 with color vector graphics and a crab-shaped blaster defending tunnel mouths for up to two alternating players, and the unreleased 1996 one-on-one fighter Tenth Degree sported anime-styled 3D combatants in the Tekken mold. Atari’s 1988 Tetris offered simultaneous two-player block stacking, the same year Toobin’ sent duos paddling downstream to hurl cans at riverbank targets, while 1990’s underwater spy caper ThunderJaws cast two elite agents against Madam Q beneath the waves. The solo, unfinished 1983 flight game Tomcat never launched its F-14, yet 1974’s four-player Touch Me tested timing like a coin-op Simon, 1989’s Tournament Cyberball 2072 let four robot-football squads earn cash for upgrades, 1978’s Tournament Table served Pong-style variants for one to four, and 1977’s monochrome Triple Hunt set one lone hunter on safari.
