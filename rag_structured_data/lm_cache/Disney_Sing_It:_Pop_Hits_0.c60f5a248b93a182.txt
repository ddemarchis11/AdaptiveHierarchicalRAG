Demi Lovato follows with three Disney-branded entries: Get Back and La La Land from 2008 and the 2009 single Don’t Forget. The Jonas Brothers contribute five Disney-affiliated cuts spanning 2007 to 2008—Hold On, SOS, When You Look Me In The Eyes, Lovebug and Burnin’ Up. Vanessa Hudgens adds her 2008 Disney-tied Sneakernight, while non-Disney voices include Colbie Caillat’s 2008 Realize and 2007 Bubbly, Jesse McCartney’s 2008 It’s Over (marked US exclusive) and 2009 How Do You Sleep, Taylor Swift’s 2006 I’m Only Me When I’m With You and 2008 Change, plus OneRepublic’s 2006 Apologize; none of these carry Disney affiliation, regional locks or release-year clustering.
