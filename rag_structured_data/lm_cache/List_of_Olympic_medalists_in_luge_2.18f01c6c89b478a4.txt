At Innsbruck 1964 Josef Feistmantl and Manfred Stengl gave Austria gold ahead of compatriots Reinhold Senn and Helmut Thaler, while Walter Aussendorfer and Sigisfredo Mair took bronze for Italy. Four years later in Grenoble Klaus Bonsack and Thomas Köhler of East Germany claimed the title, with Austria’s Manfred Schmid and Ewald Walch second and West Germans Wolfgang Winkler and Fritz Nachmann third. In Sapporo 1972 East Germans Horst Hörnlein and Reinhard Bredow shared the top step with Italy’s Paul Hildgartner and Walter Plaikner after no silver was awarded, while bronze stayed with the GDR through Klaus Bonsack and Wolfram Fiedler. Hans Rinn and Norbert Hahn then defended their 1976 Innsbruck victory at Lake Placid 1980, sandwiching silver for Italy’s Peter Gschnitzer and Karl Brunner and bronze for Austrians Georg Fluckinger and Karl Schrott. West Germany struck gold in Sarajevo 1984 via Hans Stangassinger and Franz Wembacher, ahead of Soviet pair Yevgeny Belousov and Aleksandr Belyakov and GDR bronze-medallists Jörg Hoffmann and Jochen Pietzsch, who reversed the order to win four years later in Calgary ahead of compatriots Stefan Krauße and Jan Behrendt. Krauße and Behrendt then won for unified Germany in Albertville 1992 and again in Nagano 1998, sandwiching Lillehammer 1994 where Italians Kurt Brugger and Wilfried Huber edged team-mates Hansjörg Raffl and Norbert Huber. Patric Leitner and Alexander Resch started Germany’s new century with gold at Salt Lake City 2002, while Austrians Andreas Linger and Wolfgang Linger doubled their titles in Turin 2006 and Vancouver 2010 before Germans Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt took the next two Olympic crowns at Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018.
