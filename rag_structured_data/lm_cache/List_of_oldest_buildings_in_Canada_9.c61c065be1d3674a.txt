Holy Trinity Anglican Church, erected in 1854 at Stanley Mission, stands as Saskatchewan’s earliest documented survivor. Batoche added two 19th-century landmarks: the Mission of St. Antoine de Padoue in 1884 and, eleven years later, the Jean Caron Sr. Farm Home. Saskatoon’s Marr Residence dates to 1885, while Duck Lake shelters both the 1880 Almighty Voice Jailhouse and an 1896 All Saints Anglican Church. Katepwa Beach’s All Saints Anglican Church was built in 1887, Cumberland House received its Powder Magazine in 1890, and Regina raised its Territorial Administration Building in 1891. Fort Qu’Appelle’s Hudson’s Bay Company Store opened in 1897, the same year the Motherwell Homestead rose at Abernethy.
