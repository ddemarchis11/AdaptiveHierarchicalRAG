Chuck Jones launched Pepé Le Pew on January 6, 1945 with Odor-able Kitty for Looney Tunes, returned two years later with Scent-imental Over You, then scored an Oscar on November 12, 1949 when For Scent-imental Reasons paired the skunk with Penelope. Arthur Davis took a one-off detour on October 2, 1948, letting Wellington the dog face Pepé in Odor of the Day. Jones resumed control, moving to Merrie Melodies for Scentimental Romeo (March 24, 1951) and Little Beau Pepé (March 29, 1952), then switched back to Looney Tunes for the solitary Wild Over You on July 11, 1953. Friz Freleng borrowed the character on January 2, 1954, squeezing Sylvester and Tweety into Dog Pounded, after which Jones reteamed with Penelope for The Cats Bah (March 20, 1954) and, through 1955-1962, delivered five more romances—Past Perfumance, Two Scent’s Worth, Heaven Scent, Touché and Go, Who Scent You?—all for Merrie Melodies except the last. Abe Levitow directed Penelope once in Really Scent (June 27, 1959), before Jones closed the canon with A Scent of the Matterhorn (June 24, 1961) and the Parisian finale Louvre Come Back to Me! (August 18, 1962), adding Claude the cat to Penelope’s company.
