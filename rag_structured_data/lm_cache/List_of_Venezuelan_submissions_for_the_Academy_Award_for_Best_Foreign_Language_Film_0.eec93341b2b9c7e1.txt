Venezuela entered Román Chalbaud’s El Pez que Fuma for the 50th Academy Awards in 1978 and, after a six-year gap, submitted Jacobo Penzo’s The House of Water as La casa de Agua for the 57th. Fina Torres’s Oriana followed for 1985, then Luis Alberto Lamata’s Jericho for 1991, Alejandro Saderman’s Golpes a mi Puerta (nominated as Knocks at My Door) for 1994, and José Ramón Novoa’s Sicario for 1995; none advanced.

Novoa reappeared in 2000 with Oro Diablo, again unrewarded. The 2001 entry, Alberto Aruelo’s Una casa con vista al mar, became A House with a View of the Sea, while 2002 brought Luis Manzo’s La pluma del arcángel, anglicised as The Archangel’s Feather. Leonardo Henriquez’s Sangrador represented 2003, Elia Schneider returned with Punto y Raya for 2004, and Alfredo Anzola’s 1888: El Extraordinario Viaje de Santa Isabel, submitted as 1888: The Extraordinary Voyage of the Santa Isabel, was disqualified in 2005. Solveig Hoogesteijn’s Maroa: Una Niña de la Calle, shortened to Maroa, entered the 79th awards, Mariana Rondon’s Postales de Leningrado became Postcards from Leningrad for 2007, Alberto Bellame’s El tinte de la fama was listed as The Color of Fame in 2008, Efterpi Charalambidis sent Libertador Morales, el Justiciero under its full Spanish title in 2009, and Marcel Rasquin closed the decade with Hermano in 2010; all remained un-nominated.
