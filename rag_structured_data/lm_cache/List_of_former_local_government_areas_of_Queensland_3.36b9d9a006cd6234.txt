In 1925 the South-East Queensland shires of Balmoral, Belmont, Coorparoo, Enoggera, Kedron, Moggill, Sherwood, Stephens and Taringa, together with the part-shires Tingalpa and Yeerongpilly, were abolished and folded into the new City of Brisbane. The same fate befell the former City of Brisbane itself, the City of South Brisbane, and the towns Hamilton, Ithaca—proclaimed in 1903—Toowong, Windsor and Sandgate, all absorbed into the enlarged capital city at the same moment.
