Daniela Campuzano carried Mexico’s flag in cycling at the 2016 Summer Games, while Hubertus von Fürstenberg-von Hohenlohe performed the same honor in alpine skiing for both the 2014 and 2010 Winter Olympics. Taekwondo athlete María Espinoza was the 2012 Summer bearer, preceded by diver Paola Espinosa in 2008 and Fernando Platas, who led the delegation twice, in 2004 and again in 2000. Roberto Tamés represented Mexico in bobsleigh at the 2002 Winter ceremony, and Nancy Contreras did so in cycling at the 1996 Summer Games. Von Fürstenberg-von Hohenlohe also opened the 1994 Winter Olympics for Mexico, just as Jesús Mena did for diving at the 1992 Summer Games and Roberto Alvárez for cross-country skiing at the 1992 Winter edition. Ernesto Canto carried the flag in athletics during the 1988 Summer Olympics, the same year Riccardo Olavarrieta did so in figure skating for the Winter event. Ivar Sisniega led the 1984 Summer athletics delegation, Carlos Girón the 1980 diving squad, Teresa Díaz the 1976 gymnastics team, Felipe Muñoz the 1972 swimmers, David Bárcena the 1968 track athletes, and Fidel Negrete the 1964 athletics corps.
