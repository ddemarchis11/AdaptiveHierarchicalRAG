HMAS Wagga, a Bathurst-class corvette, served from 1942 to 1962, while her sister Wallaroo, also a Bathurst corvette, was lost in 1943 after only a year. The name Wallaroo reappeared in the 1990s when MSA Wallaroo, a Bandicoot-class minesweeper, patrolled from 1991 into the 2010s. Wallaby and Warrigal, both Wallaby-class water/fuel lighters, operated alongside each other from 1983 and 1984 respectively until 1997. HMAS Waree, an auxiliary tug, worked 1942-1946, joined by HMAS Wato (1941-1945) and the civilian tug Wattle (1934-1971); a later Wattle became a crane stores lighter from 1972 to 1997. The Tribal-class destroyer Warramunga served 1942-1963, and the V-class destroyer Waterhen 1933-1941. Two ships carried the name Warrego: a River-class torpedo-boat destroyer (1912-1928) and a Grimsby-class sloop (1940-1963). HMAS Warrnambool first sailed as a Bathurst corvette 1941-1947, then re-entered service as a Fremantle patrol boat 1981-2005.
