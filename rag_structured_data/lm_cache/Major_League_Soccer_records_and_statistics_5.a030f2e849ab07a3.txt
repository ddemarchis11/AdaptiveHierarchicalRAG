Ezequiel Barco’s 2018 arrival at Atlanta United from Independiente cost a league-record $15 million, eclipsing the $14 million Atlanta paid River Plate for Pity Martínez the next year. Toronto FC splurged twice in 2014: $11 million to pry Jermain Defoe from Tottenham Hotspur and $10.8 million to bring Michael Bradley from Roma. Clint Dempsey moved from Tottenham to Seattle Sounders FC for $9.3 million in 2013, while Giovani Dos Santos left Villarreal for Los Angeles Galaxy at $8.9 million in 2015. Miguel Almirón joined Atlanta United from Lanús for $8.2 million in 2017, and fellow Lanús alum Lucas Melano headed to Portland Timbers for $6.4 million in 2015, the same fee Seattle later paid Boca Juniors for Nicolás Lodeiro in 2016. Huracán’s Kaku completed the top-ten list when New York Red Bulls secured him for $6.2 million in 2018.
