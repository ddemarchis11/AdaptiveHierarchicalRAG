Yukon Energy’s Aishihik hydro station on Aishihik Lake, commissioned with two 1975 units and a third added in 2011, delivers 37.5 MW. At Dawson City, five fixed and one movable diesel back-up units stand ready, while Faro maintains three fixed diesel back-ups and Mayo keeps two. Whitehorse hosts both the 0.81 MW Haeckel Hill wind farm—its 1993 Bonus 0.15 MW turbine joined by a 2000 Vestas V47-660 0.66 MW turbine—and the 40 MW Whitehorse Rapids hydro plant on Schwatka Lake, built in stages during 1958, 1969 and 1985. A separate 5 MW Mayo Hydro plant, dating from 1951 with two 2.5 MW units, operates alongside the Mayo diesel back-ups, and Whitehorse Rapids also has seven fixed plus one movable diesel back-up units.
