Between 1974 and 2010, twenty country names vanished from ISO 3166-1 and received four-letter “formerly-used” codes. Burma became Myanmar (BUMM) while keeping numeric code 104; Dahomey turned into Benin (DYBJ); New Hebrides adopted the name Vanuatu (NHVU); East Timor restyled itself Timor-Leste (TPTL); French Afars and Issas emerged as Djibouti (AIDJ); Byelorussian SSR simplified to Belarus (BYAA). Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia (CSHH), Gilbert and Ellice Islands separated into Kiribati and Tuvalu (GEHH), Netherlands Antilles dissolved into Bonaire-Sint Eustatius-Saba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten (ANHH), and the Pacific Trust Territory fragmented into Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Northern Mariana Islands and Palau (PCHH). The Neutral Zone was absorbed partly by Iraq and partly by Saudi Arabia (NTHH). Several territories merged into larger entities: British Antarctic Territory and Dronning Maud Land into Antarctica (BQAQ, NQAQ), French Southern and Antarctic Territories into Adélie Land/Antarctica and French Southern Territories (FQHH), Johnston and Midway Islands into United States Minor Outlying Islands (JTUM, MIUM), Metropolitan France back into France (FXFR), German Democratic Republic into Germany (DDDE), Canton and Enderbury Islands into Kiribati (CTKI), and the Panama Canal Zone into Panama (PZPA).
