Bill Boaks, standing for the Public Safety Democratic Monarchist White Resident label, polled just 5 votes in the 1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election, a tally matched by Smiley Smilie running as an Independent in 2016 Tooting, Bobby Smith with no description in 2019 Peterborough, and Kailash Trivedi of the Independent Janata Party in the 1988 Kensington contest. John Connell, campaigning under the banner “Peace – stop ITN manipulation,” received 7 votes in 1984 Chesterfield. Esmond Bevan, describing himself as Systems Designer, secured 8 votes in the 1983 Bermondsey by-election, the same figure achieved by Independents Tony Farnon and Norman Scarth in 2008 Haltemprice and Howden. Bobby Smith doubled his appearance with 9 votes in 2016 Tooting, this time listed for Bring Back Elmo.
