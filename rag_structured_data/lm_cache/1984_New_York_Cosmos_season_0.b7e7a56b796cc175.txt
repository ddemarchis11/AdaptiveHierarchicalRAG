Dan Canter, wearing the number 3 jersey, arrived from Team America to anchor the Cosmos defense, joined by Polish veteran Władysław Żmuda, who switched from Hellas Verona to take the number 6 slot. Up front, Giuseppe Damiani crossed from Milan to claim the number 7 shirt, while Stan Terlecki moved from the Golden Bay Earthquakes to wear 14 and fellow forward Andrew Parkinson, formerly of Team America, was handed the number 20 strip. Midfield reinforcements came from across the continent: Pedro DeBrito joined from the Tampa Bay Rowdies to occupy the number 22 role, Gerry Gray and Carmine Marcantonio both transferred from the defunct Montreal Manic to take 25 and 27 respectively, and Gerry Reardon arrived from the Tulsa Roughnecks as the squad’s number 30. Chico Borja, another Team America export, was given the number 28 forward berth, and defender Doc Lawson completed the incoming class, swapping the indoor New York Arrows for the outdoor Cosmos while inheriting the number 32 shirt.
