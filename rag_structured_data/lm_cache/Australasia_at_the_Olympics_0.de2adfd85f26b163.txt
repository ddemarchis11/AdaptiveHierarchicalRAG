At the 1908 London Games, the Australasia side struck gold when its rugby union squad won the men’s competition, while Snowy Baker pocketed silver in the boxing middleweight division and Frank Beaurepaire claimed two swimming medals: silver in the men’s 400 m freestyle and bronze in the 1500 m. Harry Kerr added a bronze in the 3500 m walk. Four years later in Stockholm, Fanny Durack topped the women’s 100 m freestyle, with Mina Wylie taking silver behind her. The men’s 4 × 200 m freestyle relay title went to Cecil Healy, Malcolm Champion, Leslie Boardman and Harold Hardwick; Healy also gained silver in the individual 100 m, and Hardwick earned bronze in both the 1500 m and 400 m. Anthony Wilding completed the haul with bronze in the men’s indoor singles tennis.
