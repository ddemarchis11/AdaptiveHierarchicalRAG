Jacksonville’s Jumbo Shrimp have captured six Southern League crowns—1968, 1996, 2001, 2005, 2009 and 2010—while playing at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville, whereas Pensacola’s Blue Wahoos, housed at Pensacola Bayfront Stadium, are still seeking their first title. In the Class-A Florida State League, the Fort Myers Mighty Mussels lead with seven championships (1969-72, 1978, 2018 twice) at Hammond Stadium, followed by the St. Lucie Mets with five (1988, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2006) at Tradition Field and the Tampa Tarpons with five (1994, 2001, 2004, 2009, 2010) at Legends Field. Lakeland’s Flying Tigers earned three (1976, 1977, 1992) at Joker Marchant Stadium, Daytona’s Tortugas three (1995, 2004, 2008) at Jackie Robinson Ballpark, and Charlotte’s Stone Crabs two (1983, 1990) at Charlotte Sports Park, while Bradenton’s Marauders (2016 at McKechnie Field), Clearwater’s Threshers (2007 at Spectrum Field) and Palm Beach’s Cardinals (2005 at Roger Dean Stadium) each boast one. Dunedin’s Blue Jays, Jupiter’s Hammerheads and the Florida Fire Frogs have yet to win. On the hardwood, the Lakeland Magic play in the NBA G League at RP Funding Center without a title, while the Jacksonville Giants have dominated the ABA with three banners (2012, 2013, 2016) at VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena and the Miami Midnites collected three FBA crowns (2014, 2015, 2016) at David Posnack Jewish Community Center; Daytona Beach Sharks, Native Pride and South Florida Gold remain ringless.
