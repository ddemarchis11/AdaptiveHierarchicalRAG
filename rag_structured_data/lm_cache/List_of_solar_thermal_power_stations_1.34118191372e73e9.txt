The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park Phase IV in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, leads the list with 700 MW of electrical capacity, combining parabolic trough and solar tower technologies. Golmud CSP, a 200 MW power tower installation, operates in Golmud, Qinghai province, China. Chile’s Cerro Dominador Solar Thermal Plant (Atacama 1) near María Elena in Antofagasta delivers 110 MW via a solar power tower. China dominates the smaller-capacity segment: Urat Middle Banner CSP in Inner Mongolia generates 100 MW with parabolic troughs, while five 50 MW plants—Erdos Solar Power Plant in Hanggin Banner, Dacheng Dunhuang CSP using Fresnel reflectors in Gansu, Gansu Akesai CSP and Rayspower Yumen CSP both employing parabolic troughs, and Hami CSP with a power tower in Xinjiang—each contribute 50 MW. Luneng Haixi CSP in Haixi Zhou, Qinghai Sheng, also produces 50 MW via a power tower, and Yumen CSP in Gansu adds another 50 MW using an innovative beam-down tower design.
