JCDecaux’s bike-share footprint began modestly in 2003 when Cyclocity rolled out 35 bikes across 4 stations in Córdoba, Spain, followed the same year by Gijon-Bici’s 64 bikes at 8 stands in Gijón. France soon dominated the map: Besançon’s VéloCité started in 2007 with 200 bikes at 30 stations, while Marseille answered with Le vélo’s 1 000 bikes at 130 stations that same year, Mulhouse fielded 240 Vélocité bikes at 40 points, and Lyon—JCDecaux’s 2005 flagship—still runs 4 000 Vélo’v bikes from 348 hubs. Amiens added Vélam in 2008 with 313 bikes at 26 stations, Nancy launched VélOstan’lib the same year with 250 bikes at 29 stations, and Cergy-Pontoise followed in 2009 deploying 400 VélO2 bikes across 42 stations, the same year Brussels unveiled Villo! and its 5 000 bikes at 360 stations. Dublin’s 2009 dublinbikes brought 1 500 bikes to 102 Irish stations, Créteil’s 2010 Cristolib placed 130 bikes at 10 stops, and Gothenburg’s 2010 Styr & Ställ offers 600 bikes from 50 Swedish docks. Later expansions include Ljubljana’s 2011 BicikeLJ with 510 bikes at 51 stations, Kazan’s 2013 VeliK supplying 120 bikes at 6 Russian points, Lillestrøm’s 2013 Bysykkel fielding 50 bikes at 5 Norwegian stands, and Lundahoj’s 2014 debut in Lund with 250 bikes across 17 stations.
