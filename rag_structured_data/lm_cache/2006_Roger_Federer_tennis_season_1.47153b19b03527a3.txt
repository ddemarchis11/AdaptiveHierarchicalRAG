Roger Federer opened 2006 by pocketing $142,000 for winning the Qatar ExxonMobil Open, then collected $922,560 for his Australian Open triumph, pushing his early-season earnings to $1,064,560. A $98,600 payday at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships—plus a modest $1,500 for a doubles cameo—lifted him to $1,164,660 before March. He then secured $490,000 at the Pacific Life Open and another $1,750 in doubles there, nudging his running total to $1,656,410, and followed with $533,350 for capturing the NASDAQ-100 Open, reaching $2,189,760. Clay brought $200,000 for Monte Carlo and $7,050 more in doubles, edging him to $2,396,810, and another $200,000 at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia took him to $2,596,810. After a $598,350 runner-up cheque at the French Open he stood at $3,195,160, then added $113,000 for the Gerry Weber Open and a career-best $1,190,725 for Wimbledon, surging to $4,498,885. A $400,000 Rogers Cup final and a small $15,000 Cincinnati consolation moved him to $4,513,885, before the $1,200,000 US Open title catapulted him to $5,713,885. Late-season victories in Tokyo ($118,000), Madrid ($450,000) and Basel ($142,000) carried him to $6,423,885, and he closed the year by claiming a $1,520,000 windfall at the Tennis Masters Cup, finishing with a record $7,943,885 in single-season prize money.
