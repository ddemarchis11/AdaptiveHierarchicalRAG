Sharron Angle, former Nevada assemblywoman and 2010 GOP Senate nominee, backed Rick Santorum on 2 January 2012, as did Colorado’s ex-lieutenant governor Jane Norton, ex-congressmen Bob Schaffer and Tom Tancredo—though Tancredo, a Constitutionalist who had first backed Herman Cain, joined the Santorum column the same day. Idaho treasurer Ron Crane followed on 14 February, joined that day by Megadeth front-man Dave Mustaine; Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, who had earlier endorsed Mitt Romney, switched to Santorum on 17 February. Contemporary-Christian star Michael W. Smith capped the spree on 12 March. All endorsements were later rendered moot when Santorum suspended his campaign.
