Russia debuted at Junior Eurovision 2005 with Vladislav Krutskikh’s Russian-language “Doroga k solntsu,” finishing 9th with 66 points, then soared to victory in 2006 when the Tolmachevy Twins sang “Vesenniy jazz” for 154 points. Alexandra Golovchenko placed 6th in 2007 with “Otlichnitsa,” Mikhail Puntov 7th in 2008 with “Spit angel,” and Ekaterina Ryabova took silver in 2009 with “Malenkiy prints,” scoring 116 points. After Liza Drozd and Sasha Lazin repeated that runner-up spot in 2010 with the bilingual “Boy and Girl” on 119 points, Ryabova returned in 2011—becoming the contest’s first ever returning artist—and finished 4th with 99 points for “Romeo and Juliet.” Lerika, Dayana Kirillova and the Water of Life Project each placed 4th in 2012, 2013 and 2016 respectively, while Alisa Kozhikina’s “Dreamer” brought 5th place in 2014 and Mikhail Smirnov’s “Mechta” 6th in 2015. Polina Bogusevich gave Russia its second win in 2017, earning 188 points with “Wings,” before Anna Filipchuk slipped to 10th in 2018 with “Unbreakable.” The nation’s lowest result came in 2019 when Tatyana Mezhentseva and Denberel Oorzhak placed 13th with 72 points for “A Time for Us.”
