Gene Tierney stepped before the cameras as herself on The Sir Charles Mendl Show in 1947, returned beside Ed Sullivan for Toast of the Town’s episode 6.33 in 1953, and at the 26th Academy Awards in 1954 handed the Costume Design trophy alongside hosts Donald O’Connor and Fredric March. She mystified the panel as the August 25 mystery guest on What’s My Line? in 1957, then played Ellen Galloway opposite host Ronald Reagan in the 1960 General Electric Theater installment “Journey to a Wedding.” In 1969 she portrayed Faye Simpson with Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. in The F.B.I. episode “Conspiracy of Silence” and Lenore Constable opposite Ray Milland in the TV movie Daughter of the Mind. Tierney chatted with Merv Griffin in 1974 and again in 1979, traded quips with Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show in 1980, visited Mike Douglas on his program the same year, and sat down with Dinah Shore for Dinah! also in 1980. She assumed the role of Harriet Toppington alongside Lindsay Wagner in the 1980 TV miniseries Scruples, and posthumously appeared via archive footage in the March 26, 1999 Biography documentary “Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait” hosted by Peter Graves.
