Mitchell and Kenyon’s 1901 The Arrest of Goudie, arguably the world’s first filmed crime reconstruction, was shot in Liverpool, while the 1965 musical Ferry ’Cross the Mersey brought Gerry & The Pacemakers to the city. Albert Finney’s 1971 dark comedy Gumshoe follows a would-be private eye through Liverpool streets, and Educating Rita, though filmed in Dublin, sets its story there in 1983. Coast to Coast, a 1987 comedy thriller starring Lenny Henry, was both set and shot in Liverpool the same year as Business as Usual and The Dressmaker, with Distant Voices, Still Lives following in 1988 alongside the British thriller The Fruit Machine, likewise set and filmed in the city. Dancin’ Thru the Dark appeared in 1990, the same year as Hear My Song, a drama about tenor Josef Locke that used Liverpool for part of its setting and filming. Blood on the Dole and Dark Summer both date from 1994, Dockers from 1999, Going Off Big Time—a gangster tale shot in and around Liverpool—from 2000, Digital Reaper from 2004, Dead Man’s Cards from 2006, and Charlie Noades R.I.P., a 2009 comedy, rounds out the list, with the BBC and WGBH’s 1999 David Copperfield also filming there.
