David Caruso led the first four episodes as Detective John Kelly before departing, after which Jimmy Smits stepped in as Bobby Simone for the remainder of the season. Dennis Franz anchored every episode as the grizzled Andy Sipowicz, supported throughout by James McDaniel’s Lieutenant Arthur Fancy, Nicholas Turturro’s Officer James Martinez, Sharon Lawrence’s Assistant District Attorney Sylvia Costas, Gordon Clapp’s Detective Greg Medavoy, and Gail O’Grady’s civilian aide Donna Abandando. Amy Brenneman appeared only in the first two episodes as Janice Licalsi, while Justine Miceli’s Detective Adrienne Lesniak recurred sporadically from episode 3 through the finale. Kim Delaney entered late as Detective Diane Russell, recurring from episode 19 to 22, and Bill Brochtrup’s administrative aide John Irvin did the same from episode 17 onward.
