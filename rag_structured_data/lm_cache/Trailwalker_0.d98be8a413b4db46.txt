The original Trailwalker began in 1981 on Hong Kong’s Maclehose Trail, where walkers left Pak Tam Chung in Sai Kung and had 48 hours to reach Yuen Long. Britain joined the movement in 1997 with a 30-hour South Downs crossing from Petersfield to Brighton Racecourse, later adding the circular Yorkshire Dales Trailtrekker in 2009 that starts and finishes in Skipton the same year Ireland’s 30-hour Trailtrekker ran from Donark Park to Carlingford via Newcastle, County Down.

New Zealand’s Whakatane edition, Edgecumbe to Whakatane in 48 hours, arrived in 2019, while Japan’s 2007 route linked Odawara City to Lake Yamanaka within the same two-day limit. Europe’s 30-hour challenges include Belgium’s 2008 High Fens trek from Bütgenbach to Eupen, France’s 2010 Parc du Morvan and 2014 Vallée d’Abondance events, and Germany’s 2010 circular Spessart route starting and ending in Bad Orb. Spain prefers 32-hour courses: 2011 Girona Olot to Sant Feliu de Guíxols and 2017 Euskadi’s loop in the Vitoria Mountains.
