The United States fielded the 20 mm M39 cannon during the Cold War, while Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union both relied on internal-power 20 mm designs—the Mauser MG 213 and the ShVAK respectively—during World War II. The Soviet Union later introduced the 23 mm Rikhter R-23, another Cold-War-era internal-power weapon. Germany’s 27 mm Mauser BK-27 continued the Cold-War lineage, and the modern Rheinmetall RMK30, externally powered, pushed caliber to 30 mm. Britain and France each produced 30 mm internal-power cannons—the ADEN and DEFA—during the Cold War, whereas France also fielded the externally powered GIAT 30 in the same era. Switzerland’s Oerlikon Millennium 35 mm Naval Revolver Gun System represents the modern period with its 35 mm internal-power design.
