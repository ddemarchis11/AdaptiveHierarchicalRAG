Barcelona hosts two Michelin 3-star temples: Lasarte, where Martín Berasategui and Paolo Casagrande have held the accolade since 2016, and ABaC, placed under Jordi Cruz since 2018. Down the Mediterranean coast, Quique Dacosta’s eponymous Dénia restaurant has commanded three stars since 2012, while Ángel León’s Aponiente in El Puerto de Santa María joined the elite in 2018. Girona’s El Celler de Can Roca, headed by Joan Roca, has been a three-star destination since 2009, and nearby Larrabetzu’s Azurmendi, led by Eneko Atxa, followed in 2013. In the Basque town of Lasarte-Oria, Martín Berasategui’s flagship restaurant has enjoyed the guide’s highest honour continuously since 2001. Madrid’s only 3-star establishment, DiverXO, belongs to David Muñoz, awarded in 2014. San Sebastián claims two longstanding laureates: Arzak, where Juan Mari Arzak and daughter Elena have kept the rating since 1989, and Akelare, under Pedro Subijana, promoted in 2015. The newest Spanish entry is El Cenador de Amós in Villaverde de Pontones, where Jesús Sánchez earned his third star in 2020.
