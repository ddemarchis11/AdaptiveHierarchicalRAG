The Boston Celtics dominated the late 1950s and 1960s with a 13-season Conference Finals run from 1957 to 1969, capturing 12 conference titles across 1957–1966 and 1968–69. The Los Angeles Lakers answered with two separate six-season streaks: first from 1982 to 1989 they took seven conference crowns (1982–85, 1987–89), and earlier from 1968 to 1973 they secured four (1968–70, 1972–73). St. Louis Hawks stayed in the mix for six straight years (1956–61) and won four conference titles (1957–58, 1960–61), while the New York Knicks earned three conference championships (1970, 1972–73) during their six-season stretch from 1969 to 1974. Detroit’s Pistons twice logged five-season runs, first from 1987 to 1991 with three conference wins (1988–90) and later from 2003 to 2008 with two (2004–05). Minneapolis Lakers grabbed three conference titles (1952–54) across five straight appearances (1951–55), and the franchise later added another five-season streak (1959–63) with three more crowns (1959, 1962–63). Chicago Bulls (1989–93) and Golden State Warriors (2015–19) each posted five-season streaks, the Bulls winning three conference titles (1991–93) and the Warriors sweeping all five (2015–19). Syracuse Nationals (1954–57), Philadelphia 76ers (1965–68 and 1980–83), Miami Heat (2011–14), and Cleveland Cavaliers (2015–18) each sustained four-season Conference Finals appearances, securing two, one, three, four, and four conference titles respectively.
