Cholic acid (E1000) and choline salts (E1001) serve as emulsifiers, while amylase (E1100) and the proteases—protease, papain, bromelain and ficin grouped under E1101—double as stabilisers and flavour enhancers. Glucose oxidase (E1102) acts as an antioxidant, invertase (E1103) as a stabiliser, lipases (E1104) are listed without an assigned purpose, and lysozyme (E1105) functions as a preservative. Polydextrose (E1200) works simultaneously as a stabiliser, thickening agent, humectant and carrier, whereas polyvinylpyrrolidone (E1201) and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (E1202) act purely as stabilisers; polyvinyl alcohol (E1203) and pullulan (E1204) appear without specified roles. The dextrin roasted to white and yellow shades (E1400), acid-treated starch (E1401), alkaline-modified starch (E1402), bleached starch (E1403) and monostarch phosphate (E1410) are all thickening agents, with oxidized starch (E1404) also emulsifying, while enzyme-treated starch (E1405) is included without a declared purpose.
