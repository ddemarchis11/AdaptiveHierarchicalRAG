Texas honors the Commemorative Air Force as its official air force and pan de campo as the state bread, while the Dutch oven reigns as the designated cooking implement and the towering Sauroposeidon claims the dinosaur title. Chili became the state dish in 1977, Texas 42 the official domino game, and cotton the celebrated fiber and fabric in 1997. The Guadalupe bass took its place as state fish in 1989, square dance became the folk dance in 1991, and the Texas red grapefruit was named state fruit in 1993. The Lone Star Cut distinguishes Texas as the only state with its own gemstone cut, while Texas blue topaz has served as state gem since 1969. Sideoats grama became the state grass in 1971, the monarch butterfly the insect symbol in 1995, and the buckyball molecule represents Texas scientific heritage. Western swing fills the air as state music, the acoustic guitar the musical instrument, and the native pecan has been the state nut since 1919. Among peppers, the native chiltepin and the jalapeño, designated in 1995, share official recognition.
