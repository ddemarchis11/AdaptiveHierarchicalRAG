Nelson Rivas joined from Inter Milan on a free transfer 3 October 2011 to anchor the defence wearing number 2, while fellow centre-back Hassoun Camara, Evan Bush in goal, and midfielder Siniša Ubiparipović were all promoted from the NASL side on frees between 11 October and 1 November. On 23 November Montreal plundered the Expansion Draft, selecting Zarek Valentin from Chivas USA, Justin Mapp from Philadelphia, Jeb Brovsky from Vancouver, Collen Warner from Real Salt Lake, Josh Gardner from Columbus and Sanna Nyassi from Colorado, then immediately traded for Chivas striker Justin Braun, sending James Riley the other way. That same day they landed Tyson Wahl from Seattle for allocation money, and within five days added Fort Lauderdale’s Bryan Arguez on a free. Late November brought captain Davy Arnaud from Sporting KC in exchange for Seth Sinovic and allocation money, and Jamaican goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts from Los Angeles for allocation money. December saw Miguel Montaño arrive on a free from Seattle, Greg Sutton from New York, Danish-based Canadian international Patrice Bernier from Lyngby, and Brazilian Felipe from FC Lugano, while Duke forward Andrew Wenger was selected first overall in the 2012 MLS SuperDraft on 12 January.
