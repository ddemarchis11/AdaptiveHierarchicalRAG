Ama in Aichi is officially あま市 though its kanji 海部 survives, while Fukui’s Awara appears as あわら市 beside the older 芦原. えびの市 names Ebino in Miyazaki, written 蝦野 in kanji, and えりも町 stands for Erimo in Hokkaidō, whose kanji 襟裳 is still recognised.

Mie’s Inabe is いなべ市 against 員弁, Kōchi’s Ino appears as いの町 beside 伊野, and Chiba’s Isumi is いすみ市 though 夷隅 remains. Fukushima’s Iwaki is written いわき市 while 磐城 persists, and Ishikawa’s Kahoku is かほく市 against 河北. Wakayama supplies Katsuragi as かつらぎ町 with 葛城 and Minabe as みなべ町 with 南部. Gunma counters with Midori written みどり市 though 緑 is known, and Minakami as みなかみ町 beside 水上. Aichi’s Miyoshi is みよし市 paired with 三好, Hokkaidō’s Mukawa is むかわ町 against 鵡川, and Aomori offers Mutsu as むつ市 with 陸奥 and Oirase as おいらせ町 with 奥入瀬. Akita’s Nikaho completes the set as にかほ市 though 仁賀保 is remembered.
