The Atlantic Coast Conference placed seven schools in the 2007 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament—Clemson, Florida State, Miami (FL), North Carolina, NC State, Virginia, and Wake Forest—while the Big 12 sent six: Baylor, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma State, Texas, and Texas A&M. The Southeastern Conference was represented by five teams—Arkansas, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, South Carolina, and Vanderbilt—and the Big West and Conference USA each earned four bids, with UC Irvine, UC Riverside, Cal State Fullerton, and Long Beach State comprising the Big West contingent, and East Carolina, Memphis, Rice, and Southern Miss making up the C-USA group. The Pac-10, despite Oregon State’s eventual national title, received only four invitations: Arizona, Arizona State, Oregon State, and UCLA. The Big East, Big Ten, and Sun Belt each claimed three spots—Louisville, Rutgers, and St. John’s from the Big East; Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio State from the Big Ten; and Louisiana-Lafayette, New Orleans, and Troy from the Sun Belt. Jacksonville and Stetson carried the Atlantic Sun, Creighton and Wichita State represented the Missouri Valley, Western Carolina and Wofford came from the Southern Conference, and Pepperdine and San Diego earned West Coast Conference berths. Single-bid leagues included Charlotte (Atlantic 10), Albany (America East), Coastal Carolina (Big South), VCU (Colonial), UIC (Horizon), Brown (Ivy), and LeMoyne (Metro Atlantic).
