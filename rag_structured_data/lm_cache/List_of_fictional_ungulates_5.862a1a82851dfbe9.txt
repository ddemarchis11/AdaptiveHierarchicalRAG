Dash the live-action donkey grazes in Big Barn Farm alongside Ewenice the sheep, Gobo the goat, and Madam the cow, while Cranky Doodle Donkey and Matilda, a male and female donkey couple, trot through My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Elliot the puppet moose stars in his own show Elliot Moose, just as Mr. Moose the puppet moose jokes on Captain Kangaroo, and Lamb Chop the puppet ewe appears across various Shari Lewis programs. Muffin the mule, a 1933 Hogarth Puppets creation, headlines Muffin the Mule, while the puppet alpaca duo Nuzzle and Scratch host their self-titled series. Shaun the stop-motion sheep leads Shaun the Sheep, and Zaza the puppet zebra trots through De Fabeltjeskrant.
