In 2004-05 the San Antonio Spurs claimed the division with a 59-23 (.720) mark and went on to win the NBA Finals. They repeated as division kings the next year at 63-19 (.768) but fell in the Conference Semifinals. Dallas seized the 2006-07 crown behind a blistering 67-15 (.817) record yet were stunned in the First Round. New Orleans, still the Hornets, took the 2007-08 title at 56-26 (.683) before bowing out in the Conference Semifinals. San Antonio returned to the top in 2008-09 with a 54-28 (.659) ledger but lost in the opening playoff round, and again in 2010-11 at 61-21 (.744) with the same early exit. Dallas regained the division in 2009-10 at 55-27 (.671) yet could not survive the First Round. The Spurs rattled off three straight division wins: 2011-12 at 50-16 (.758) before a Conference Finals loss, 2012-13 at 58-24 (.707) before a Finals defeat, and 2013-14 at 62-20 (.756) before capturing another NBA title. Houston broke through in 2014-15 at 56-26 (.683) and pushed to the Conference Finals. San Antonio answered with 67-15 (.817) in 2015-16 and 61-21 (.744) in 2016-17, exiting in the Semifinals and Conference Finals respectively. Houston closed the span with back-to-back crowns: 65-17 (.793) in 2017-18 and 53-29 (.793) in 2018-19, both seasons ending in the Conference Finals and Semifinals.
