Baron Athenry, created in 1172 for the Bermingham family, slipped into dormancy in 1799 after having also held the Earl of Louth title until that peerage expired. The de Courcy line still holds the 1223-created Baron Kingsale, while the Fitzmaurice family’s Baron Kerry of the same year survives and now graces the Marquess of Lansdowne. FitzGerald’s Baron Desmond, dating from 1259, was forfeited in 1582 after centuries of also being Earl of Desmond. Barry’s Baron Barry, begun in 1261, lasted until 1823, having added Viscount Buttevant and Earl of Barrymore along the way. Butler (later Clifford-Butler) has held Baron Dunboyne since 1324, confirmed by 1541 letters patent. Preston’s Baron Gormanston, created c. 1370, remains extant and also yields the Viscount Gormanston and a UK peerage; Preston’s younger-title Baron Loundres, created 1478, is subsidiary to that viscountcy. Fleming’s Baron Slane, also c. 1370, was forfeited in 1691. St Lawrence’s Baron Howth (1430) expired in 1909 after accumulating Viscount St Lawrence and Earl of Howth. Plunkett’s Baron of Dunsany, perhaps 1439, survives, whereas Plunkett’s Baron Killeen (1449) lasted until 1984 while also serving as Earl of Fingall. Fitzeustace’s Baron Portlester (1462) ended in 1496; Barnewall’s Baron Trimlestown of the same year endures. Bold’s Baron Ratoath (1468) vanished in 1479. Nugent’s Baron Delvin (1486) stands today, later becoming Earl of Westmeath and briefly UK Marquess of Westmeath. Eustace’s Baron Kilcullen (1535), subsidiary to Viscount Baltinglass, was forfeited in 1585. Power’s Baron Power (1535), under the Earl of Tyrone, was forfeited in 1704. Fitzmaurice’s Baron Odorney (1537) expired in 1541. O Conor Faly’s Baron Offaly (1538) ended in 1552.
