Sri Lanka’s 335-km Mahaweli River rises in Horton Plains and empties at Trincomalee, while the 164-km Malvathu River starts near Dambulla and reaches the sea at Vankalai. From the same Dambulla hills, the 148-km Kala Oya flows through Wilpattu to its mouth, and the 145-km Kelani River descends from Adam’s Peak to Colombo. Ritigala feeds the 142-km Yan Oya that ends at Pulmoddai, and Kurunegala gives birth to the equally long Deduru Oya draining into Chilaw. Adam’s Peak also spawns the 138-km Walawe River, which reaches Ambalantota, and the 129-km Kalu Ganga, which finishes at Kalutara. Maduru Oya, both a river and its own source, travels 135 km to Kalkudah, whereas Hakurugammana’s 134-km Maha Oya waters Negombo. Bandarawela’s Kirindi Oya runs 117 km to Bundala, Lunugala’s Kumbukkan Oya covers 116 km to Kumana, and Namunukula’s Menik Ganga flows 114 km through Yala. Gongala’s Gin Ganga travels 113 km to Gintota, Saliyagama’s Mi Oya winds 109 km to Puttalam, and Yalkumbura’s Gal Oya covers 108 km before reaching Oluvil.
