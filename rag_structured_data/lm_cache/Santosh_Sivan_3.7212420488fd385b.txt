Santosh Sivan earned his first National Film Award in 1988 for directing the English short Story of Tiblu, and two years later won Best Cinematography for the Malayalam feature Perumthachan. He repeated that cinematography honour in 1991 for the Malayalam short Mohiniyattam and again in 1995 for Kalapani. Switching to the director’s chair, he guided the Hindi children’s film Halo to the 1996 National Award, then the Tamil features The Terrorist and Malli to top honours in 1998, the latter cited for its environmental message. That same year his camera work on Iruvar (Tamil) and Dil Se (Hindi) both earned National Awards for Best Cinematography. In 2004 he directed Navarasa, which was named Best Tamil Feature, while his 2008 Kannada short Prarambha won for Best Educational Film, and in 2011 he co-produced the Malayalam feature Indian Rupee, recipient of the Best Feature Film in Malayalam award.
