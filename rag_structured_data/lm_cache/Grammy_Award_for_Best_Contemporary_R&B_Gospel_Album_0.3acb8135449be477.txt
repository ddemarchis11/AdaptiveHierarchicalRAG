Take 6 won the first Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album Grammy in 1991 for *So Much 2 Say*, edging out The Winans’ *Return*, Richard Smallwood Singers’ *Portrait*, Edwin Hawkins’ *Face to Face* and Daryl Coley’s *He’s Right On Time/Live from Los Angeles*. BeBe & CeCe Winans repeated for *Different Lifestyles* the next year, while producer Mervyn Warren and friends took 1993 with the soulful re-imagining *Handel’s Messiah: A Soulful Celebration*. The Winans themselves claimed 1994’s trophy with *All Out*, after which Take 6 collected a second win for 1995’s *Join the Band*. CeCe Winans went solo to triumph in 1996 with *Alone In His Presence*, and Kirk Franklin & the Family exploded onto the scene, winning 1997’s *Whatcha Lookin’ 4* and 1999’s *The Nu Nation Project*. Between those victories, Take 6 secured their third title with 1998’s *Brothers*. Yolanda Adams then dominated the new century, seizing 2000’s *Mountain High … Valley Low* and 2002’s concert set *The Experience*. Mary Mary and producer Warryn Campbell broke through in 2001 with *Thankful*, Eartha surprised in 2003 with *Sidebars*, and Donnie McClurkin followed in 2004 with *… Again*. Smokie Norful’s 2005 debut *Nothing Without You* earned him the prize, CeCe Winans returned in 2006 with *Purified*, and Kirk Franklin added two more wins for 2007’s *Hero* and 2009’s *The Fight of My Life*, while Fred Hammond’s 2008 *Free to Worship* and Heather Headley’s 2010 *Audience of One* closed the category’s final seasons before its 2012 retirement.
