América arrived from São José do Rio Preto to contest the 2005 Campeonato Paulista after finishing 12th the previous year, while Atlético Sorocaba, 15th in 2004, hoped to climb from their Sorocaba base. Corinthians, based in São Paulo, carried the weight of a disappointing 16th-place campaign, as did Guarani from Campinas, who had ended 2004 in 17th. Inter de Limeira earned promotion as 2004 Série A2 champions, and Ituano, 14th last season, returned from Itu. Marília, 10th in 2004, and Mogi Mirim, 18th, both aimed higher, while Palmeiras, fourth in 2004, sought the title from their São Paulo home. Paulista, runners-up in 2004, came from Jundiaí with title ambitions. Ponte Preta, seventh last year, and Portuguesa, 13th, both represented Campinas and São Paulo respectively, as Portuguesa Santista, sixth in 2004, arrived from Santos. Rio Branco, 11th the prior season, hailed from Americana, while Santo André, ninth in 2004, and Santos, third, both targeted the trophy. São Caetano entered as reigning 2004 champions, São Paulo, fifth last year, chased a record 21st crown, União Barbarense, eighth in 2004, came from Santa Bárbara d'Oeste, and União São João, 19th the previous season, arrived from Araras hoping to survive.
