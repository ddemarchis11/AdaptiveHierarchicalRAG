Baron Carleton, created for the Boyle family on 19 October 1714, expired in 1725, while the same day’s creation for the Temples as Baron Cobham ended in 1749 yet left the 1718 Viscount Cobham line still alive. Watson’s Baron Throwley, also dated 19 October 1714, became extinct in 1746 after its first holder was simultaneously made Earl of Rockingham. Parker’s Baron Parker, dated 10 March 1716, survives and produced the Earls of Macclesfield in 1721. Coningsby’s barony of 18 June 1716 died with him in 1729, taking his Irish barony and the 1719 earldom with it. The Onslow barony of 19 June 1716 endures and generated the UK Earls of Onslow in 1801. Newport’s Baron Torrington of 20 June 1716 lasted only until 1719, whereas Cadogan’s Baron Cadogan of Reading, created 21 June 1716, fell extinct in 1726, though a later 1817 barony survives with the Earls Cadogan. Romney’s barony, born 22 June 1716, is extant and yielded the UK Earls of Romney in 1801. St John’s Baron St John of Battersea, dated 2 July 1716, lives on, its holder also Viscount St John from day one and Viscount Bolingbroke since 1751. Cholmondeley’s Baron Newburgh, 10 July 1716, persists, merging with the earldom and later UK marquessate of Cholmondeley. Newton’s 1717 Baroness of Hampton Court expired in 1761, having been Viscountess and then Countess Coningsby. Paulet’s 1717 Baron Pawlett of Basing died out in 1754 while his older English titles continue. Stanhope’s 1717 Baron Stanhope of Elvaston survives, the viscountcy also created that day and the earldom of 1718 now merged with the Earls of Harrington. The second Baron Cobham, created 23 May 1718 for the Temple-Grenville line, is extant, passing through marquesses and dukes of Buckingham until 1889, then uniting with the Earls Temple of Stowe and Barons Lyttelton. Boscawen’s 1720 Baron Boscawen-Rose endures, paired from birth with Viscount Falmouth and later with a short-lived UK earldom. Moreton’s 1720 Baron Ducie became extinct in 1770, though a 1763 revival continues. Wallop’s 1720 Baron Wallop survives as the viscountcy of Lymington and later earldom of Portsmouth. Lechmere’s 1721 barony ended in 1727, while Byng’s 1721 Baron Byng persists, created Viscount Torrington simultaneously.
