Ian Browne, Steven Hooker and Bill Lawry all attended RMIT before claiming Olympic or Commonwealth gold, while Jared Tallent is still studying there after adding Olympic silver to his Commonwealth race-walking title. Elizabeth Gardner, Lydia Lassila and Nick Morris each earned a Bachelor of Applied Science (Human Movement) at RMIT, with Lassila later soaring to Winter Olympic gold and Morris becoming a Paralympic champion wheelchair basketballer. Current student David Morris continues the tradition as a freestyle skier, and fellow student Elizabeth Patrick coxes the rowing squad. Carrie Graf, who captained and coached the Australian women’s basketball team, holds the same degree, as does James Tomkins, the triple-Olympic-gold rower who also works as a financial analyst after completing a Bachelor of Business. Julien Wiener, the first Jewish Test cricketer for Australia, also studied business management at RMIT. Allan Hahn, Emeritus Professor at the Australian Institute of Sport, received an honorary Doctor of Applied Science from RMIT where he taught, and Charlie Walsh, former national cycling coach, developed the RMIT-AIS Olympic Superbike while on faculty. Gus Johnston, armed with a BA in Advertising, campaigns against homophobia in sport after representing Australia in hockey, and Max Walker, architect via RMIT’s Diploma of Architecture, played both Test cricket and AFL for Melbourne. Colin Ridgway, another attendee, became the first Australian to play in the NFL with the Dallas Cowboys, and golf great Peter Thomson took physics classes at RMIT en route to five British Open titles.
