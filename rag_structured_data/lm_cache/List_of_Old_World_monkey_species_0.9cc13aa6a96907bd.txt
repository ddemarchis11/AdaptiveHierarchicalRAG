Allen’s swamp monkey, Allenopithecus nigroviridis, was classified by Pocock in 1907 and remains of least concern. The Angolan talapoin, Miopithecus talapoin, dates to Schreber’s 1774 description and is also least concern, while its close relative the Gabon talapoin, Miopithecus ogouensis, was distinguished much later by Kingdon in 1997 and shares the same status. The long-limbed patas monkey, Erythrocebus patas, was named by Schreber in 1775 and is still least concern. Within Chlorocebus, Linnaeus himself described both the green monkey and the grivet in 1758, both least concern; Neumann’s 1902 Bale Mountains vervet, C. djamdjamensis, is vulnerable, whereas Ogilby’s 1841 tantalus monkey, F. Cuvier’s 1821 vervet monkey, and Scopoli’s 1786 malbrouck all remain least concern. Among Cercopithecus, Schwarz’s 1932 Dryas monkey is critically endangered, Linnaeus’s 1758 Diana monkey is vulnerable, Schreber’s 1774 roloway monkey is endangered, and Matschie’s 1905 golden monkey is also endangered, while Linnaeus’s 1766 greater spot-nosed monkey, Wolf’s 1822 blue monkey, Pocock’s 1907 silver monkey, Sykes’s 1831 Sykes’s monkey, Schreber’s 1774 mona monkey, and Waterhouse’s 1838 Campbell’s mona monkey are all listed as least concern.
