Badou Ndiaye left Galatasaray for Stoke City in 2018 after the club pocketed €16 million, the highest fee the Lions have ever received. A year earlier, Bruma’s €15 million move to RB Leipzig ranked second, while Arda Turan’s €12 million switch to Atlético Madrid in 2011 once held the record. In 2019, two departures followed close behind: Ozan Kabak joined VfB Stuttgart for €11 million and Garry Rodrigues headed to Al-Ittihad for €9 million. Hakan Şükür’s €8.2 million transfer to Internazionale back in 2000 still places sixth, narrowly ahead of Kader Keïta’s €8.15 million sale to Al-Sadd in 2010. Burak Yılmaz moved to Beijing Guoan for €8 million in 2016, Adrian Ilie left for Valencia at €7 million in 1998, and Alex Telles completed the top ten when Porto paid €6.5 million for him in 2016.
