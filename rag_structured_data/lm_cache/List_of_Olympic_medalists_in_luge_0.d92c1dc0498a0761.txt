At the 1964 Innsbruck Games, Thomas Köhler led a German sweep of the men’s singles podium ahead of Klaus Bonsack and Hans Plenk. Manfred Schmid gave Austria gold in 1968, while former champion Köhler took silver and compatriot Klaus Bonsack bronze, both now for East Germany. East Germans filled every step at Sapporo 1972 as Wolfgang Scheidel, Harald Ehrig and Wolfram Fiedler claimed gold, silver and bronze. Detlef Günther kept the East German streak alive in Innsbruck 1976, edging West Germany’s Josef Fendt and teammate Hans Rinn. Bernhard Glass made it five straight East German titles at Lake Placid 1980, ahead of Italy’s Paul Hildgartner and West German Anton Winkler. Hildgartner reversed the order in Sarajevo 1984, winning gold while Soviets Sergey Danilin and Valery Dudin completed the podium. Jens Müller restored East German supremacy at Calgary 1988, followed by West Germany’s Georg Hackl and Soviet Yuri Kharchenko. Georg Hackl then began his own dynasty, winning gold for unified Germany at Albertville 1992 ahead of Austrians Markus Prock and Markus Schmidt, repeating the feat at Lillehammer 1994 with Prock second and Italy’s Armin Zöggeler third, and again at Nagano 1998, this time ahead of Zöggeler and German Jens Müller. Zöggeler finally reached the top at Salt Lake City 2002, relegating Hackl to silver and Prock to bronze, and defended his title in Turin 2006 ahead of Russia’s Albert Demchenko and Latvia’s Mārtiņš Rubenis. Germany regained the summit at Vancouver 2010 through Felix Loch, with teammate David Möller second and Zöggeler third, and Loch repeated in Sochi 2014 ahead of Demchenko and Zöggeler once more. Austria’s David Gleirscher claimed Pyeongchang 2018 gold, the United States’ Chris Mazdzer took silver and Germany’s Johannes Ludwig bronze.
