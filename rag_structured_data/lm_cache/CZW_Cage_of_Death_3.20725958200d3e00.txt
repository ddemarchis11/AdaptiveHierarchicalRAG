The H8 Club—Nate Hatred and Nick Gage—then overpowered Jay and Mark Briscoe in straight tag action, while Joey Corman pinned both Samir and Brad Michaels to survive their triple-threat. John Zandig and Danny Rose fought to a chaotic no-contest, and The S.A.T. (Joel, Jose and Will Maximo) saved Pastor Jim’s CZW career by besting Chris Divine, Quiet Storm and Brian XL in a six-man wager. Jon Dahmer and Fast Eddie Valentine claimed a three-way tag victory over Chri$ Ca$h & GQ and Chris Stylz & Ian Knoxx. Trent Acid unified the CZW and BJW Junior Heavyweight titles by dethroning Ruckus, Johnny Kashmere downed Menace one-on-one, and Mad Man Pondo survived Z-Barr in a hardcore brawl. Adam Flash snatched the CZW Iron Man Championship from defending Nick Berk and Nick Mondo in a Falls-Count-Anywhere triple-threat, and, in the night’s culmination, Justice Pain kept his CZW World Heavyweight crown by defeating Wifebeater inside the lethal Cage of Death.
