The inaugural 1913 Carlisle trial crowned the United Kingdom trio of W. B. Gibb, W. B. Little and Charlie Collers, while T. K. Teddy Hastings became the first American to start. War cancelled the 1914 Grenoble event, but Switzerland’s J. Morand, A. Robert and Eduard Gex won the revived 1920 Grenoble contest and repeated their victory at Geneva in 1921 and 1922. Sweden’s Gustav Göthe, Yngve Eriksson, Bernhard Malmberg and J. A. Bylund dominated Stockholm 1923. Belgium 1924 introduced the Silver Vase, won by Norway’s C. Vaumund, O. Graff and J. Juberget while the UK’s G. S. Arter, C. Wilson and F. W. Giles took the International Trophy. In 1925 Southampton the same British squad—Bert Kershaw, G. S. Arter and F. W. Giles—claimed both trophies, and Australia’s vase entry finished third. Buxton 1926 saw Graham Walker, J. Lidstone and P. Pike double for Britain and a ladies’ team place third for the first time. Ambleside 1927 made history when Marjorie Cottle, Edyth Foley and Louise MacLean became the only women’s team ever to win the Silver Vase, while L. Crisp, Graham Walker and F. W. Giles secured Britain’s International Trophy. Harrogate 1928 kept the UK on top through V. C. King, F. W. Neill and H. G. Uzzell, and the 1929 Munich-Geneva route rewarded G. R. Butcher, George Rowley and F. W. Neill. Italy’s Rosolino Grana, Luigi Gilera and Miro Maffeis won back-to-back trophies at Grenoble 1930 and Merano 1931. Britain regained honours in 1932 with Albert E. Perrigo, George Rowley and N. P. O. Bradley. Nazi Germany’s Ernst Jakob Henne, Josef Stelzer, Josef Mauermayer and Wiggerl Kraus triumphed at Llandrindod Wells 1933 and repeated with Wiggerl Kraus, J. Müller and teammates in Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1934 and Oberstdorf 1935, where Arthur Geiss, Walfried Winkler and Ewald Kluge also gave Germany the Vase. Britain struck back in 1936 as Vic Brittain, George Rowley, W. S. Waycott and E. Belsten won the International event, and in 1937 Brittain, Rowley, Waycott and Gordon Wolsey repeated while the Netherlands’ A. P. van Hammersveld, G. Bakker-Schut and J. Moejes captured the Vase.
