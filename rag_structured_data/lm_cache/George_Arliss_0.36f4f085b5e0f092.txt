George Arliss first appeared on screen in 1921 as the enigmatic Dr. Muller in “The Devil” and that same year won acclaim portraying Benjamin Disraeli in “Disraeli.” Through 1922 he embodied Montgomery Royle, a pianist turned recluse, in “The Man Who Played God,” played shipping magnate James Alden in “The Ruling Passion,” and appeared as himself in “The Starland Review.” He then assumed the turban of the Rajah of Rukh for 1923’s “The Green Goddess,” became frugal inventor John Reeves in 1924’s “Twenty Dollars a Week,” and reprised Disraeli for the 1929 sound remake that earned him an Oscar. Arliss returned as the Raja of Rukh in 1930’s “The Green Goddess” and portrayed stubborn sea-captain Sylvanus Heythorp in “Old English.” In 1931 he took the title role of Alexander Hamilton and again played James Alden in “The Millionaire.” During 1932 he revisited Montgomery Royle and appeared as financier Henry Wilton in “A Successful Calamity.” He embodied Voltaire in 1933, revived John Reeves in “The Working Man,” and played Phillip, the King, in “The King’s Vacation.” His final 1934 performances cast him as the Duke of Wellington in “The Iron Duke,” Cabot Barr in “The Last Gentleman,” and both Mayer and Nathan Rothschild in “The House of Rothschild.”
