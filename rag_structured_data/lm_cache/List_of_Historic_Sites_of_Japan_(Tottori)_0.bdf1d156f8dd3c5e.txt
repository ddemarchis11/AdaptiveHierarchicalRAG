Kotoura shelters the vanished Sainoo temple and the mountain palace where emperors once paused at Senjōsan, while nearby Ōtaka preserves the offices that once administered the region. Kurayoshi guards three ancient tombs—Amidaji, Sanmyōji and the tower bases of Ōhara and Ōmidō temples—echoing a time when courtiers and monks shared the same hills. Tottori city itself claims the tomb of Ifukibe Tokotari-hime, the solid Kajiyama burial mound, and the Aoyakamiji ruins where early farmers left their pots. Iwami’s Iwai Haiji once rose in pagoda form above the coast, and Misasa’s forested Mount Mitoku still carries the memory of ascetic monks. Yurihama’s Hashizu tombs and Yonago’s Mukoeyama and Aoki sites trace the same kofun culture, while the sprawling Mukibanda settlement spills across both Yonago and Daizen. Wakasa keeps the ghost-story stones of Oniga Castle, and Kamiyodo Haiji in Yonago marks another lost temple yard. Farther south, the old Chizu Road climbs over Shitosaka Pass, a route once traveled by merchants and warriors alike.
