The Bremner Historic Mining District, listed on June 15, 2000, lies along Golconda Creek roughly 47 miles southeast of Chitina. Chisana’s two entries—the Historic District added November 29, 1985, and the adjoining Historic Mining Landscape registered May 14, 1998—sit near the airstrip at Chisana and at an undisclosed Northway location respectively. Kansky’s, entered May 16, 1997, stands at mile 42 on Nabesna Road two miles north of the old Nabesna Mine. The Kennecott Mines, recorded July 12, 1978, occupy the east side of Kennicott Glacier about 6½ miles north of McCarthy. In McCarthy itself, the General Store gained recognition January 31, 1978, on the corner of Kennicott Avenue and Skolai Street, while the Power Plant followed on April 26, 1979, beside McCarthy Creek off Shushanna Avenue. The Nabesna Gold Mine Historic District, enrolled May 25, 1979, rests at the base of White Mountain at the road’s end. Finally, the Valdez Trail–Copper Bluff Segment, listed February 12, 1998, parallels the Richardson Highway at milepost 106.5 near Copper City.
