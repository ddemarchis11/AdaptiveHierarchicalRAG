20th Century Fox Animation’s 2012 output reached Network Ten and its digital offshoot Eleven, while Showtime’s movie channels handled subscription viewing. DreamWorks Animation split its library: older titles stayed on Seven and Nine plus 7mate and GO!, but new releases shifted to Network Ten, Eleven and Showtime, with Movie Network retaining the back-catalogue pay rights. Nickelodeon Movies followed the same Ten/Eleven/Showtime path. Pixar films screened on Seven Network and its digital siblings 7Two and 7mate, and on pay they rotated through Movie Network, Disney Channel and Disney Junior. Sony Pictures Animation’s run on Nine Network and GO! was set to expire late 2012, after which Showtime movie channels would take over. Universal Animation Studios parked its titles on Seven and 7mate with Showtime carriage. Vanguard Animation likewise used Nine and GO! free-to-air and Showtime on pay. Walt Disney Animation Studios mirrored Pixar’s pattern: Seven, 7Two, 7mate free-to-air and Movie Network, Disney Channel, Disney Junior for subscribers. Warner Bros. Animation kept to Nine and GO! on broadcast, while Movie Network and Cartoon Network shared the pay-window.
