Red Hat offers an LDAP solution under a GPL linking exception that explicitly permits linking to non-GPL code, while another Red Hat product built on 389 Directory Server is released straight GPL. Microsoft, Apple, CA Technologies, Critical Path, ForgeRock, IBM, and NetIQ all distribute proprietary LDAP software. Michael Ströder and the Apache Software Foundation each provide Apache License 2.0 offerings. Stefan Bebbo Franke and the Mandriva development team publish GPL-licensed packages. Atos (formerly Siemens) is also listed among the developers. Mark Cavage’s work carries the MIT License, whereas Martin Hedenfalk and OpenBSD use the ISC license. The Open Identity Platform Community and Sun Microsystems both choose CDDL, and Kurt Zeilenga’s Slapd-based project is available under the OpenLDAP Public License.
