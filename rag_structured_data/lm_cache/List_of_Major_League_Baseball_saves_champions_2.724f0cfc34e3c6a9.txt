In 1882 Eddie Fusselback of the St. Louis Brown Stockings recorded the first recognized save, a lone one. The next year Bob Barr and Tony Mullane matched that single save while splitting their seasons between Pittsburgh and St. Louis. Four pitchers—Oyster Burns, Frank Mountain, and Hank O'Day, representing Baltimore, Columbus, and Toledo—shared the 1884 lead with one save apiece, after which Burns alone topped the 1885 ledger with three for Baltimore. The 1886 crown splintered among six men: Bones Ely, Dave Foutz, Nat Hudson, Ed Morris, and Joe Strauss, each finishing one save for either Louisville or St. Louis. Adonis Terry then posted three for Brooklyn Grays in 1887, and in 1888 Pop Corkhill, Bob Gilks, and Tony Mullane each collected one while wearing Cincinnati or Cleveland uniforms. Mullane doubled his previous total by saving five for Cincinnati in 1889, Herb Goodall followed with four for Louisville Colonels in 1890, and Boston Reds teammates Bill Daley and Cinders O'Brien closed out 1891 with two saves each.
