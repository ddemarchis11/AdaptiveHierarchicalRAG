Albania’s 1924 Albanian Parliament Building is slated for replacement, while Andorra only obtained its New Parliament of Andorra in 2014. Austria has legislated from the 1883 Austrian Parliament Building since the late 19th century, and Belarus from the 1934 House of Government.

Denmark’s Folketing gathers in the 1928 Christiansborg Palace, and Estonia’s Riigikogu in Toompea Castle, whose oldest parts reach back to the early 13th century but whose parliamentary hall was added in 1922. Finland’s 1931 Parliament House, France’s 1728 Palais Bourbon for the National Assembly and 1615 Luxembourg Palace for the Senate, Germany’s 1894 Reichstag for the Bundestag and 1904 House of Lords of Prussia for the Bundesrat, Greece’s 1843 Old Royal Palace for the Hellenic Parliament, Hungary’s 1904 Hungarian Parliament Building, and Iceland’s 1881 Alþingishúsið for the Althing complete the list.
