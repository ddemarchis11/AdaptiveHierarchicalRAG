Nintendo’s Donkey Kong Country ruled the 1995 charts for eight months at #1, while its own fighting title Killer Instinct peaked at #1 across four. Acclaim matched that top spot with the basketball slam of NBA Jam: Tournament Edition, which stayed six months, and again with the run-and-gun Judge Dredd, though Dredd lasted only three. Acclaim’s Justice League Task Force fought its way to #2 for the same three-month span, and their Spider-Man action game reached #4 for four. Williams Entertainment’s Mortal Kombat 3 climbed to #2 in three months, Kyle Petty’s No Fear Racing parked at #3, and Nintendo rounded out the list with Kirby’s Avalanche and EarthBound each peaking at #4 after three charting months.
