Defending champion Santa Cruz entered the 2013 Pernambucano as 26-time winners from Recife and top-seeded holders playing at the 60,040-seat Arruda, while city rivals Sport, 39-time champions last crowned in 2010 and fresh off a 2012 runner-up finish, staged matches at Ilha do Retiro for 32,983 fans. Náutico, fourth in 2012, brought 21 titles (most recently 2004) to Aflitos, a 22,856-capacity Recife ground. Salgueiro, third the previous year, hosted at Cornélio de Barros (10,240), and Petrolina, fifth in 2012, used Paulo de Souza Coelho (5,000). Caruaru supplied two clubs: Central, tenth in 2012, and Atlético do Porto, seventh, both sharing 19,548-seat Lacerdão. Promoted sides Chã Grande, 2012 Série A2 champions, and Pesqueira, that division’s runners-up, stepped up to Barbosão (4,000) and Joaquim José de Brito (3,500) respectively. Serra Talhada (ninth), Ypiranga of Santa Cruz (sixth) and Belo Jardim (eighth) rounded out the field at Nildo Pereira, Limeirão and Mendonção/SESC, each holding 5,000 or fewer; none of these clubs had ever lifted the trophy.
