Downsville Bridge, 174 ft long, was built in 1854 across the East Branch of the Delaware River in Delaware County and joined the National Register of Historic Places in 1999, the same year that county-mates Fitches Bridge (100 ft, 1870, West Branch), Hamden Bridge (125 ft, 1859, West Branch) and the 32-ft Lower Shavertown, or Campbell, Bridge over Trout Creek (1877) were also listed. Delaware County’s Tuscarora Club Bridge, a 38-ft 1870 span across Mill Brook, lacks that listing. Jay Bridge, a 160-ft 1857 structure, carries Essex County traffic over the Ausable River, while 50-ft Salisbury Center Bridge (1875) crosses Spruce Creek in Herkimer County and was listed in 1972. Hyde Hall Bridge, an 1825 53-ft span over Shadow Brook in Glimmerglass State Park, Otsego County, gained registry status in 1998, matched that year by Saratoga County’s 35-ft Copeland Bridge (1879) across Beecher Creek. Schoharie County’s 232-ft Blenheim Bridge, erected in 1855 across Schoharie Creek, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964, entered the Register in 1966, was destroyed by Tropical Storm Irene on 28 August 2011 and rebuilt 2017-2018. Sullivan County holds the NRHP-listed 98-ft Beaverkill, or Conklin, Bridge (1865), the 48-ft Bendo, or Willowemoc, Bridge (1860), the 119-ft Halls Mills Bridge (1912) over the Neversink River, and the 117-ft Van Tran Flat, formerly Mott’s Flat or Livingston Manor, Bridge (1860) across Willowemoc Creek. Tompkins County’s 115-ft Newfield Bridge (1853) crosses Cayuga Creek and was listed in 2000, the same year Ulster County’s 62-ft Ashokan, or New Paltz Campus, Bridge (1889) over Esopus Creek joined the Register, along with the 138-ft Perrine’s Bridge (1844) across the Wallkill River, which had already been listed in 1973, and the 66-ft Grants Mills Bridge (1902) over Mill Brook, listed in 1999. Ulster County also has the 27-ft Forge Bridge and 43-ft Tappan, or Kittle, Bridge, both from 1906 and spanning Dry Brook.
