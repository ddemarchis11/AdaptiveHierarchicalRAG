Sumerian, an isolate tongue of Mesopotamia, fell silent in the early second millennium BCE. Around the same epoch Eblaite, a Semitic language, disappeared from Syria, while slightly earlier, by about 1500 BCE, the isolate Hattic had already vanished from Anatolia. Northwest Anatolia lost Palaic, another Anatolian branch member, around 1300 BCE, and within two centuries Hittite itself, the dominant Anatolian language, was extinct by roughly 1100 BCE. Hurrian, belonging to the Hurro-Urartian family, ceased to be spoken after about 1200 BCE across its wide span from Anatolia through Syria to Mesopotamia. Slightly later, after 1170 BCE, the Syrian coastal Semitic language Ugaritic also fell out of use. Finally, the still-undeciphered Cypro-Minoan script, used on Cyprus, went out of recorded use sometime between 1550 and 1050 BCE.
