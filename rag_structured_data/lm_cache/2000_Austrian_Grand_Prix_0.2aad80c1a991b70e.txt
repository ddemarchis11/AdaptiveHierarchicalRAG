Giancarlo Fisichella’s Benetton-Playlife slotted eighth at 1:11.658, with Mika Salo’s Sauber-Petronas ninth on 1:11.761 and Jos Verstappen’s Arrows-Supertec rounding out the top ten in 1:11.905. Pedro Diniz and Pedro de la Rosa filled the next two spots for Sauber and Arrows, 1:11.931 and 1:11.978, while Nick Heidfeld’s Prost-Peugeot, Alexander Wurz’s Benetton and Heinz-Harald Frentzen’s Jordan followed within a hundredth of each other.
