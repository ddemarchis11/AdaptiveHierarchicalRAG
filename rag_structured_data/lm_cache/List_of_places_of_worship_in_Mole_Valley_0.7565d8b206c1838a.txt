St James’s at Abinger Common, Grade II*, is a restored 12th- and 13th-century Surrey vernacular church whose Lawrence Lee 1967 east window holds the county’s finest modern glass. In Ashtead, the 13th-century St Giles, Grade II*, keeps 16th-century stained glass from Herckenrode Abbey, while its 1905 brick chapel-of-ease St George’s was designed by Blomfield’s firm; nearby, Ashtead Baptist Church, registered in 1924, succeeded an 1895 chapel, and St Michael’s Roman Catholic Church, registered October 1967, replaced a 1948 building with Peter French’s octagonal brick design. Betchworth’s Grade I St Michael’s, mid-13th-century but reworked 1851 and 1870, memorialises Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie. Box Hill’s St Andrew’s, completed 1969, links to Brockham’s Christ Church, Ferrey’s 1850 Grade II limestone-and-firestone cruciform. Buckland’s Grade II St Mary the Virgin was wholly rebuilt 1860 by Henry Woodyer with Bargate stone and a shingled bell turret; Woodyer also rebuilt Capel’s 13th-century St John the Baptist in 1865 with similar materials. Capel’s 1724-25 Quaker meeting house, Grade II, serves a 1650s congregation. Charlwood’s Grade I St Nicholas shows Norman origins, 13th-century aisle and 15th-century reconfiguration. Coldharbour’s 1848 Christ Church, Ferrey’s sandstone chapel rebuilt 1904 by Caröe, crowns a hilltop. In Dorking, St Paul’s (1857) and St Martin’s (1868-77, Grade II*) share Ferrey and Woodyer designs; St Martin’s now houses Methodists whose earlier chapels are gone. Crossways Baptist (1869/76) and Dorking Baptist Chapel’s 1910 tin-tabernacle-cored building serve Baptists, while Moores Road shelters the First Church of Christ, Scientist. The former Plymouth Brethren room on Hart Road, registered 1984, became the 100-capacity Dorking Muslim Community Association and Mosque in 2006; Brethren now meet in the Mint Gardens room registered March 1997.
