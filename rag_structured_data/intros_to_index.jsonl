Aside from the NBA Playoff appearance streaks, this list also includes the NBA Finals appearance streak and the NBA championships win streak. On March 24, 1971, the Philadelphia 76ers (formerly known as the Syracuse Nationals) set an NBA record of 22 consecutive playoff appearances in the time between the 1950 NBA Playoffs and the 1971 NBA Playoffs. The 76ers won two NBA championships during their streak. As of 2019, the San Antonio Spurs are tied for the NBA record of 22 consecutive playoff appearances. The Spurs' streak started in the 1998 NBA Playoffs and is, as of 2019, the longest active playoff streak in any major North American sports league. The Spurs have won five NBA championships during their streak. The Boston Celtics hold the longest consecutive NBA Finals appearance streak with ten appearances between 1957 and 1966. During the streak, the Celtics won eight consecutive NBA championships - also an NBA record."}

Restriction enzymes are one class of the broader endonuclease group of enzymes. Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into five types, which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA substrate at their recognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another. To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each sugar-phosphate backbone (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix. These enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and provide a defence mechanism against invading viruses. Inside a prokaryote, the restriction enzymes selectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called restriction digestion; meanwhile, host DNA is protected by a modification enzyme (a methyltransferase) that modifies the prokaryotic DNA and blocks cleavage. Together, these two processes form the restriction modification system. Over 3,000 restriction enzymes have been studied in detail, and more than 600 of these are available commercially. These enzymes are routinely used for DNA modification in laboratories, and they are a vital tool in molecular cloning.", "section_title": "", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme", "serialization": "intro_only", "to_index_text": "A restriction enzyme, restriction endonuclease, or restrictase is an enzyme that cleaves DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites within molecules known as restriction sites.

The Alien was a science fiction film under production in the late 1960s which was eventually cancelled. The film was being directed by Bengali Indian director Satyajit Ray and produced by Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures. The script was written by Ray in 1967, based on Bankubabur Bandhu, a Bengali story he had written in 1962 for Sandesh, the Ray family magazine. In 1987, the superhero film Mr. India was a huge success which strengthened the hold of sci-fi films in India, especially Bollywood. Indiatimes Movies ranks the movie amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films. Mr. India brought the idea of science fiction to the general people in India. In 2003, the blockbuster film Koi. Mil Gaya marked the beginning of the successful Krrish film series, which is the first sci-fi/superhero film series in Indian cinema. The 2018 Tamil film 2.0 starring Rajinikanth and Amy Jackson is one of the most expensive and the most successful sci/fi film ever produced in India."}

It was the tenth round of the 2000 Formula One season and the 24th Austrian Grand Prix. The 71-lap race was won by McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen after starting from pole position. His teammate David Coulthard finished second with Rubens Barrichello third for the Ferrari team. Michael Schumacher, the eventual Drivers' Champion, led the Championship going into the race and started from fourth position alongside Barrichello. At the first corner BAR's Ricardo Zonta ran into the rear of Michael Schumacher. The incident forced the German to retire and caused a safety car deployment. After the safety car pulled in after one lap Häkkinen and Coulthard extended a comfortable lead over the rest of the field. When Häkkinen made his pit stop on lap 38, he rejoined behind Coulthard, but ahead of Barrichello. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 41, allowing Häkkinen back into the lead which he held to clinch his second victory of the 2000 season. As a consequence of the race, Coulthard's second place narrowed the gap to Michael Schumacher in the Drivers' Championship to six points, while Häkkinen's win meant he closed to within two points of Coulthard.

Michael Schumacher, the eventual Drivers' Champion, led the Championship going into the race and started from fourth position alongside Barrichello.

Non-sporting competitions in areas such as speech, debating and dance have also been added to the event schedule. Country Week is recognised as being the biggest event of its kind in the southern hemisphere. The event typically involves about 40 schools with around 3,000 students and over 200 teachers and support staff. The carnival is held toward the end of the second school term in late June and early July and lasts for one week. The Amanda Young Foundation has supported the event by donating water bottles to all participating students. The bottles carry messages about the dangers of sharing water bottles to prevent the spread of meningococcal disease. In 2015 the number of participants at the carnival was approximately 3,700, with the RAC sponsoring the event distributing water bottles as part of a road safety campaign, highlighting the over representation of young drivers dying on country roads."}

They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the National Hockey League's (NHL) Eastern Conference. The Flyers were founded in 1967 as one of six expansion teams, increasing the size of the NHL at that time to 12 teams. Since the franchise was established, the team has won the Stanley Cup two times as league champions in 1974 and 1975, the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl six times - twice as division champions and four times as conference champions - and the Prince of Wales Trophy as conference champions four times.

Only Bobby Clarke and Eric Lindros have won regular season most valuable player honors as Flyers. Clarke won the Hart Memorial Trophy three times in 1972-73, 1974-75 and 1975-76 while Lindros won in 1994-95. Both Clarke and Lindros also won the Lester B. Pearson Award, awarded to the most outstanding player as voted by the players and now known as the Ted Lindsay Award, Clarke in 1973-74 and Lindros in 1994-95. Four Flyers players have won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs, twice when the Flyers won the Stanley Cup - Bernie Parent in 1974 and 1975 - and twice when they lost in the finals - Reggie Leach in 1976 and Ron Hextall in 1987.

They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the National Hockey League's (NHL) Eastern Conference. The Flyers were founded in 1967 as one of six expansion teams, increasing the size of the NHL at that time to 12 teams. Since the franchise was established, the team has won the Stanley Cup two times as league champions in 1974 and 1975, the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl six times - twice as division champions and four times as conference champions - and the Prince of Wales Trophy as conference champions four times. Prior to the Presidents' Trophy first being award in 1985-86, the Flyers led the league in points three times in 1974-75, 1979-80, and 1984-85, but have not led the league in points at the end of the regular season since. Only Bobby Clarke and Eric Lindros have won regular season most valuable player honors as Flyers. Clarke won the Hart Memorial Trophy three times in 1972-73, 1974-75 and 1975-76 while Lindros won in 1994-95. Both Clarke and Lindros also won the Lester B. Pearson Award, awarded to the most outstanding player as voted by the players and now known as the Ted Lindsay Award, Clarke in 1973-74 and Lindros in 1994-95. Four Flyers players have won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs, twice when the Flyers won the Stanley Cup - Bernie Parent in 1974 and 1975 - and twice when they lost in the finals - Reggie Leach in 1976 and Ron Hextall in 1987.
