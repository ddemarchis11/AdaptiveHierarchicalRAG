The United States is the tournament's first dominant team, winning the tournament 14 of the 18 events held (as of 2012), as well as medaling in all but one tournament. The Czech Republic is the next most successful team, winning the tournament twice and winning 14 medals.\nIn 2007 the United States beat the Czech Republic for gold in Düsseldorf, Germany, while Germany itself took bronze. Great Britain stunned the United States 5-4 in the 2008 final in Philadelphia, with Canada earning bronze. The Czechs then began a four-year reign: in 2009 they defeated Canada in Varese, Italy, leaving the United States with bronze; in 2010 they edged the United States again in Düsseldorf while France claimed bronze; in 2011 they repeated the same medal order in Roccaraso, Italy; and in 2012 they overcame host Colombia in Bucaramanga, the United States settling for bronze. Anaheim 2013 saw the Czechs beat the United States once more, Canada third. France broke through in 2014, downing Canada in Toulouse with the Czechs third. The Czech Republic returned to the top in 2015 in Rosario, Argentina, ahead of France and Italy, then in 2016 defeated Italy on home ice in Asiago/Roana, Switzerland taking bronze. France regained the title in 2017 in Nanjing, China, over Spain with Italy third. The United States reclaimed gold in 2018 in Asiago/Roana, Italy, ahead of Italy and Spain. In 2019 the Czechs again edged the United States in Barcelona, Spain, with Spain third. Cartagena, Colombia, was slated to host the 2020 championship."}

There are 32 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories. The UNESCO list contains one designated site in both England and Scotland (the Frontiers of the Roman Empire) plus eighteen exclusively in England, five in Scotland, three in Wales, one in Northern Ireland, and one in each of the overseas territories of Bermuda, Gibraltar, the Pitcairn Islands, and Saint Helena. The first sites in the UK to be inscribed on the World Heritage List were Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast; Durham Castle and Cathedral; Ironbridge Gorge; Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey; Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites; and the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd in 1986. The latest site to be inscribed was the Jodrell Bank Observatory in England in July 2019. The constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (commonly referred to as UNESCO) was ratified in 1946 by 26 countries, including the UK. Its purpose was to provide for the conservation and protection of the worlds inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of history and science. The UK contributes £130,000 annually to the World Heritage Fund which finances the preservation of sites in developing countries. Some designated properties contain multiple sites that share a common geographical location or cultural heritage. The United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO advises the British government, which is responsible for maintaining its World Heritage Sites, on policies regarding UNESCO. The UK National Commission for UNESCO conducted research in 2014-15 on the Wider Value of UNESCO to the UK, and found that the UK's World Heritage Sites generated an estimated £85 million from April 2014 to March 2015 through their association with the global network.

The gu vary greatly in area (from 10 to 47 km²) and population (from less than 140,000 to 630,000). Songpa is the most populated, while Seocho has the largest area. Gu are similar to London's or New York's boroughs or Tokyo's 23 special wards, and a gu's government handles many of the functions that are handled by city governments in other jurisdictions. This city-like standing is underscored by the fact that each gu has its own legislative council, mayor and sister cities. Each gu is further divided into dong or neighborhoods. Some gu have only a few dong while others (like Jongno-gu) have a very large number of distinct neighborhoods.\nDobong-gu, a residential district in Seoul’s northeast since 1963, comprises Dobong-dong, Banghak-dong, Ssangmun-dong and Chang-dong and is famed for Dobongsan mountain.

The Award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The Finnish Academy Awards submission is selected by an expert jury which is chosen by the Finnish Film Foundation. All 32 films listed below were accepted by AMPAS, although two films- Drifting Clouds and Lights in the Dusk- were withdrawn by director Aki Kaurismäki after the films were sent to Hollywood in both 1996 and 2006. According to Mark Johnson, the chairman of the Academy's foreign-language committee, he was told by the Finnish selection committee that Kaurismaki does not like film competitions. As of 2017[update], only one Finnish film has been nominated for the Foreign Film Oscar- their 2002 submission The Man Without a Past was nominated for an Oscar on January 2003. Ironically, Past was also directed by Kaurismäki, but was not withdrawn. However, Kaurismaki boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony as protest over the U.S. involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Because of Kaurismaki's withdrawals, Klaus Härö has represented Finland more than any other Finnish director - four times.\nRauni Mollberg’s Maa on syntinen laulu represented Finland at the 46th Academy Awards in 1973 but was not nominated, and he returned thirteen years later with Tuntematon sotilas for the 59th ceremony with the same result. Pirjo Honkasalo and Pekka Lehto’s Tulipää went forward in 1980, followed by Jaakko Pakkasvirta’s Pedon merkki in 1981, Heikki Partanen’s Pessi ja Illusia in 1984, Päivi Hartzell’s Lumikuningatar in 1987, Pekka Parikka’s Talvisota in 1990, Christian Lindblad’s Ripa ruostuu in 1994 and Markku Pölönen’s Kivenpyörittäjän kylä in 1995, all unsuccessfully.

Rubens Barrichello finished second for Ferrari with BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve third scoring his last F1 podium finish. Juan Pablo Montoya started from pole position alongside Ralf Schumacher. Michael Schumacher, the eventual Drivers' Champion started fourth, behind Mika Häkkinen of McLaren. The race was marked by an airborne accident going into the first corner involving Michael Schumacher and Luciano Burti for Prost, which caused the track to be scattered with shreds of carbon fibre and the race restarted as a result. Both Williams drivers retained their positions at the end of the first lap, with Michael Schumacher passing Häkkinen for third. Over the course of the race, Montoya extended a considerable lead over Ralf Schumacher.

The carnival is organised by School Sport WA. The carnival includes sports such as Australian rules football, hockey, soccer, netball, volleyball and basketball in a range of divisions. Non-sporting competitions in areas such as speech, debating and dance have also been added to the event schedule. Country Week is recognised as being the biggest event of its kind in the southern hemisphere. The event typically involves about 40 schools with around 3,000 students and over 200 teachers and support staff. The carnival is held toward the end of the second school term in late June and early July and lasts for one week. The Amanda Young Foundation has supported the event by donating water bottles to all participating students. The bottles carry messages about the dangers of sharing water bottles to prevent the spread of meningococcal disease. In 2015 the number of participants at the carnival was approximately 3,700, with the RAC sponsoring the event distributing water bottles as part of a road safety campaign, highlighting the over representation of young drivers dying on country roads.\nIn 2005 Bunbury Senior High School won the boys basketball title while Geraldton Senior College claimed both the boys football and boys hockey crowns, and Albany Senior High School took out the boys soccer championship.

From 2012 forward, recordings in this category have been shifted to the Best Gospel Album category.\nTake 6 won the first Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album Grammy in 1991 for *So Much 2 Say*, edging out The Winans’ *Return*, Richard Smallwood Singers’ *Portrait*, Edwin Hawkins’ *Face to Face* and Daryl Coley’s *He’s Right On Time/Live from Los Angeles*. BeBe & CeCe Winans repeated for *Different Lifestyles* the next year, while producer Mervyn Warren and friends took 1993 with the soulful re-imagining *Handel’s Messiah: A Soulful Celebration*. The Winans themselves claimed 1994’s trophy with *All Out*, after which Take 6 collected a second win for 1995’s *Join the Band*. CeCe Winans went solo to triumph in 1996 with *Alone In His Presence*, and Kirk Franklin & the Family exploded onto the scene, winning 1997’s *Whatcha Lookin’ 4* and 1999’s *The Nu Nation Project*. Between those victories, Take 6 secured their third title with 1998’s *Brothers*. Yolanda Adams then dominated the new century, seizing 2000’s *Mountain High … Valley Low* and 2002’s concert set *The Experience*. Mary Mary and producer Warryn Campbell broke through in 2001 with *Thankful*, Eartha surprised in 2003 with *Sidebars*, and Donnie McClurkin followed in 2004 with *… Again*. Smokie Norful’s 2005 debut *Nothing Without You* earned him the prize, CeCe Winans returned in 2006 with *Purified*, and Kirk Franklin added two more wins for 2007’s *Hero* and 2009’s *The Fight of My Life*, while Fred Hammond’s 2008 *Free to Worship* and Heather Headley’s 2010 *Audience of One* closed the category’s final seasons before its 2012 retirement."}

The Top 14 is at the top of the national league system operated by the French National Rugby League, also known by its French initialism of LNR. There is promotion and relegation between the Top 14 and the next level down, the Rugby Pro D2. The fourteen best rugby teams in France participate in the competition, hence the name Top 14. The competition was previously known as the Top 16. The league is one of the three major professional leagues in Europe (along with the English Premiership and the Pro14, which brings together top clubs from Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Italy and South Africa), the most successful European teams from which go forward to compete in the European Rugby Champions Cup, the pan-European championship which replaced the Heineken Cup after the 2013-14 season. The first ever final took place in 1892, between two Paris-based sides, Stade Français and Racing Club de France, which were the only teams playing the competition that year, with the latter becoming the inaugural champions. The competition has been held on an annual basis since, except from 1915 to 1919 - because of World War I - and from 1940 to 1942 - because of World War II. Toulouse is the most successful club in the competition with 20 titles.\nVincent Clerc tops the all-time try chart with 101 touchdowns amassed for Grenoble, Toulouse and Toulon between 2002 and 2018. One behind him, Laurent Arbo crossed 100 times while turning out for Pau, Castres, Montpellier and Perpignan across 1991-2007. Aurélien Rougerie’s entire 1999-2018 career at Clermont yielded 96 tries, good for third. Fellow Clermont star Napolioni Nalaga added 87 in two spells there and at Lyon from 2006-2017. Still active Toulouse full-back Maxime Medard has 81 since 2004, while Montpellier’s Timoci Nagusa has 78 from 2010 onward.
